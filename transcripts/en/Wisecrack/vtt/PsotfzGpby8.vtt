<v Speaker 1>legendary lotharios rick Sanchez and </v>

10
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>bojack horseman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save it for Youtube.</v>

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this wisecrack addition on</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism with bojack and rick.</v>

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Many assume that nihilism simply means </v>
<v Speaker 1>believing in nothing.</v>

14
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.703
<v Speaker 1>Nothing Lebowski Nacin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually refers to a number of </v>

15
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and ethical positions.</v>

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.673
<v Speaker 1>And while they all differ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different flavors of nihilism all </v>

17
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>begin from the shared premise that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is no inherent meaning value or order in</v>

18
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

19
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a solution here.</v>

20
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>You're not seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although many in the edge,</v>

21
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Lord might get a kick out of using </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilists catchphrases to show the world</v>

22
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.794
<v Speaker 1>their heart of darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't speak because of Friedrich </v>

23
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

24
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.024
<v Speaker 1>most of these folks miss out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of nihilism rather than a </v>

25
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>philosophy best embodied by tyler </v>
<v Speaker 1>durden.</v>

26
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Nihilism can be the basis for meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldviews.</v>

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to narrow our focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to two different branches of </v>

28
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.384
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential nihilism and cosmic </v>

29
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.294
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as cosmic pessimism to help </v>

30
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>us navigate the wonderful world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential nihilism.</v>

31
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.233
<v Speaker 1>We'll be talking about everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite functionally alcoholic horse </v>

32
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.413
<v Speaker 1>bojack horseman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to provide insight into the cold </v>

33
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:36.324
<v Speaker 1>rationality of cosmic nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're turning to another functional </v>

34
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick Sanchez,</v>

35
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry even if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy relationship with alcohol,</v>

36
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you'll still be able to figure out which</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism is right for you.</v>

37
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Part one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential nihilism.</v>

38
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Existential nihilism is nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

39
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>When we realized that there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherent meaning to our lives and at its</v>

40
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:58.254
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human existence is just a precarious </v>

41
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.014
<v Speaker 1>dance upon the grave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to us to create meaning in our </v>

42
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>lives through our own freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

43
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>We can have values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we must create and sustain them,</v>

44
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's this worldview which fuels </v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack horseman.</v>

45
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.343
<v Speaker 1>I'm responsible for my own happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even be responsible for my own </v>

46
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.254
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into the nihilists </v>

47
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>undercurrents of bojack horseman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history of</v>

48
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The term nihilism,</v>

49
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.604
<v Speaker 1>which first coined at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>18th century by German philosopher </v>

50
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.934
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich Jacoby and Response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment reason which you worried </v>

51
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>would explain away the conditions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

52
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.773
<v Speaker 1>This rationalist med that explained way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any spaces of uncertainty or mystery </v>

53
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>rendering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything there was knowable,</v>

54
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.853
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar,</v>

55
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>well scientifically traditions or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot thing.</v>

56
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the first philosophers to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the implications of nihilism was</v>

57
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.534
<v Speaker 1>Soren Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the New York Times has referred to </v>

58
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.353
<v Speaker 1>as the Danish doctor of dread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although kingergarten ever used the </v>

59
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism is regarded as one of the</v>

60
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.430
<v Speaker 1>fathers of modern existentialism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>

61
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't known for the substance abuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical for many nihilist.</v>

62
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.843
<v Speaker 1>He did pour so much sugar into his </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee that it piled up above the </v>

63
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:07.744
<v Speaker 1>liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an iceberg warning of adult onset </v>

64
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true story,</v>

65
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>which is insane and probably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous than sipping scotch before you</v>

66
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:16.264
<v Speaker 1>get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trigger Guard thought that despair was </v>

67
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>an essential part of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

68
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>which he referred to as the sickness </v>
<v Speaker 1>unto death.</v>

69
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.243
<v Speaker 1>This human despair is dialectical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means you're always at </v>

70
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>odds with yourself or to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

71
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.483
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane doesn't get better and it doesn't </v>

72
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.304
<v Speaker 1>get easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep lying to myself saying I'm </v>

73
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>gonna Change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm poisoning.</v>

74
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.263
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were either in despair because we think </v>

75
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>nothing is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened again.</v>

76
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Why do I keep thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things will make me happy.</v>

77
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.923
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with me or we despair </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we think everything is possible </v>

78
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>and can't make a decision.</v>

79
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 2>What should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make a break for it.</v>

80
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Drive to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start a new life there.</v>

81
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.123
<v Speaker 2>Made a local girl fall in love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked my way into a line job at a </v>

82
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.720
<v Speaker 2>textile plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gradually worked my way up until I owned</v>

83
00:03:57.721 --> 00:03:58.381
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

84
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>what am I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't run a textile plant.</v>

85
00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 2>That's way too much responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

86
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:03.980
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The walls are closing in.</v>

87
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.710
<v Speaker 2>We're in in despair</v>

88
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.543
<v Speaker 1>about being who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I just do them to be the person that </v>

89
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I am the person in that book or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair because we can't be who we think</v>

90
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>we are all this time I assumed there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to me than everyone thought,</v>

91
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.333
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there isn't this despair is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the root of the melancholy that plagues </v>

92
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>much of the human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same melancholy we see in almost all</v>

93
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:28.380
<v Speaker 1>of the characters of bojack horseman </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Todd's worries about his sexuality.</v>

94
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a sexual to princess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolyn's anxieties about motherhood.</v>

95
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Your pregnancy is no longer viable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>how do we make it viable again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except Mr.</v>

97
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.193
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems fine and of course bojack is a </v>

98
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 1>character that seems to have it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful acting career,</v>

99
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:53.340
<v Speaker 1>beautiful home money and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet he can't seem to enjoy any of it and</v>

100
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>even when seemingly good things happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

101
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>he manages to either feel disappointed.</v>

102
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>You're an Oscar nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel?</v>

103
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel I feel I feel the same or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sabotaged his own happiness.</v>

104
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since this morning,</v>

105
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>you ate all the muffins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I eat them all in one sitting because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no self control and I hate myself.</v>

107
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.683
<v Speaker 1>No matter what decision he makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's marked by regret and no matter how </v>

108
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:23.034
<v Speaker 1>well things work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack is haunted by an unshakeable </v>

109
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:28.590
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here regard describes this experience in</v>

110
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either or if you marry,</v>

111
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 1>you will regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do not marry,</v>

112
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you will also regretted rather you marry</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you do not marry,</v>

113
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you will regret both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what bojack does,</v>

114
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:42.210
<v Speaker 1>whether it's virtuous or selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stench of regret follows.</v>

115
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Look what I did to the people I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to care about.</v>

116
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.053
<v Speaker 1>I had sex with the one person I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen you be in love with and for </v>

117
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard.</v>

118
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an exception to the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

119
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the very nature of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

120
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.030
<v Speaker 1>We see bojack experiencing this type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self doubt during an anxiety attack,</v>

121
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.973
<v Speaker 1>hasn't seasoned for idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do all day pieces or </v>

122
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.753
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety is caused by the uncertainty </v>

123
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>that lies beneath every decision and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>considers anxiety.</v>

124
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways that we experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom because we're free,</v>

125
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.174
<v Speaker 1>we're responsible for our own decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that these decisions leads </v>

126
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.194
<v Speaker 1>to anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paragraph describes this anxiety as </v>

127
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>standing at the edge of an abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety may be compared with dizziness.</v>

128
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.820
<v Speaker 1>He who's I happened to look down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the yawning abyss,</v>

129
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>becomes dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence,</v>

130
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.403
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is the dizziness of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this terrifying freedom means we can </v>

131
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.084
<v Speaker 1>literally do anything including botched </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide attempts via yellow convertible </v>

132
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.733
<v Speaker 1>for character yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to work through this </v>

133
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:38.954
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and despair is the acceptance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmic absurdity of reality and </v>

134
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>living one's life by faith.</v>

135
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not keen on using religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>to combat meaninglessness,</v>

136
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.423
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Character Carton thinks that faith is </v>

137
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:51.674
<v Speaker 1>simply the courage to attempt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful existence in the face of a </v>

138
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:55.274
<v Speaker 1>meaningless world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you need to take </v>

139
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.764
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your own happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this at the conclusion of season </v>

140
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While nothing drastic has changed,</v>

141
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>bojack has accepted the complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his relationship with his mother,</v>

142
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma,</v>

143
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>but budget is that you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

144
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>it's me and it's decided to find meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his new little sister hollyhock.</v>

145
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Almost a hundred years after character </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard collapsed in the street and died,</v>

146
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.403
<v Speaker 1>a French philosopher named John Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sartre picked up the mantle and develop </v>

147
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.364
<v Speaker 1>the first explicitly existentialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and in a move that both rick </v>

148
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:29.894
<v Speaker 1>and bojack would love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sartre had many of his philosophical </v>

149
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>insights while drinking at bars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

150
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>While bojack himself isn't a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand by my critique of South Sartre,</v>

151
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.013
<v Speaker 1>argued that existentialism is a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to the meaninglessness of the </v>

152
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>universe by creating meaning ourselves.</v>

153
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>So while there is no ethical value to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>found in the world,</v>

154
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>nor a god to take comfort in humans can </v>
<v Speaker 1>create meaning through our own lives.</v>

155
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>There may be no cure to disparity </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

156
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>but at least we can try to make our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives meaningful.</v>

157
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.173
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to remember that while </v>

158
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 1>existential nihilism offers the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of a meaningful life,</v>

159
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.873
<v Speaker 1>eight guarantees us nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's our responsibility to </v>

160
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>constantly create meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As kierkegaard said,</v>

161
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>we must live forward and understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

162
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Closure is a made up thing by Steven </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg to sell movie tickets.</v>

163
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:18.014
<v Speaker 1>It's like true love and the Munich </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics doesn't exist in the real </v>

164
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing to do now is just to keep</v>

165
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>living forward part to cosmic nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>or pessimism.</v>

166
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Now that we've seen the ways in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential nihilism manages to offer </v>

167
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>some meaning and hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the less optimistic branch</v>

168
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 1>of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cosmic nihilism.</v>

169
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Cosmic nihilism is a colder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper,</v>

170
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.364
<v Speaker 1>rational branch of thought which argues </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no truth or meaning to be </v>

171
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>found in the universe and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed human meanings like freedom,</v>

172
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

173
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.543
<v Speaker 1>and joy are just myths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We believe in order to cope with the </v>

174
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.873
<v Speaker 1>empty void at the center of our reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the we create our at best fables </v>

175
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>that act as coping mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Q,</v>

176
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:00.740
<v Speaker 1>morty.</v>

177
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Nobody exists on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody belongs anywhere.</v>

178
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come Watch TV</v>

179
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>for the cosmic dial list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to keep busy while we wait for</v>

180
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:11.274
<v Speaker 1>the coming heat death of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're kidding ourselves if we think </v>

181
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>we're capable of creating genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

182
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems to fit the philosophy of Rick</v>

183
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

184
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.053
<v Speaker 1>while admitting nothing matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still waxes poetic about taking the </v>

185
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>universe for a ride.</v>

186
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.340
<v Speaker 4>When you know nothing matters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe is yours and I've never met</v>

187
00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:29.174
<v Speaker 4>a universe that was into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Universe is basically an animal at </v>

188
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.700
<v Speaker 4>grazes on the ordinary creates infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>idiots just to eat them,</v>

189
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 4>not unlike your friend Timmy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy.</v>

190
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardly matters.</v>

191
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetie,</v>

192
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Speaker 4>you know smart people get a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 4>climb on top,</v>

193
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.233
<v Speaker 4>take reality for a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it will never stop trying to throw </v>

194
00:09:43.101 --> 00:09:45.800
<v Speaker 4>you and eventually it will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no other way off.</v>

195
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Bojack's version of this sentiment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly more optimistic.</v>

196
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>The universe is a wild</v>

197
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.730
<v Speaker 3>beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tame it.</v>

198
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.240
<v Speaker 3>All you can do is try to live inside it.</v>

199
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Husband nihilism explains Rick's overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>hedonism.</v>

200
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.263
<v Speaker 1>He's happy to spend his days partaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in orgies and drinking himself into a </v>

201
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>stupor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if rick believes in science,</v>

202
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.013
<v Speaker 1>it seems more likely just a way to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>his time then some way to improve the </v>

203
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.244
<v Speaker 1>lives of those around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While existential nihilism might work </v>

204
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>for the optimists and hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any good edge,</v>

205
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:17.124
<v Speaker 1>Lord knows that cosmic nihilism is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only philosophical position for those </v>

206
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>brave enough to turn themselves into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle.</v>

207
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.783
<v Speaker 1>Pickle Rick and morty goes to great </v>
<v Speaker 1>lengths to establish rick as this kind </v>

208
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>of nihilist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing everything to science and while</v>

209
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:31.974
<v Speaker 1>not a cosmic nihilist himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual forefather of this </v>

210
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 1>position is Prussian mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the year runner up 1883,</v>

211
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich Nietzsche is famous nihilist </v>
<v Speaker 1>adage,</v>

212
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 1>God is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been scrawled in as many high school</v>

213
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>bathroom walls as the phone number for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom.</v>

214
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>This phrase is often misinterpreted as </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that God is dead.</v>

215
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 1>There is no meaning and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>

216
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.013
<v Speaker 1>What cosmic nihilism is not a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment about reality or a counter </v>

217
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:57.444
<v Speaker 1>ethics to religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Rick Sanchez yelling this or </v>

218
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If God exists,</v>

219
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it's me or this July.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made them up and even meet himself,</v>

220
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>wasn't ready for the full on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump into the void required for the full</v>

221
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>membership into the cosmic dial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His club,</v>

222
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>unlike Nietzsche and nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic nihilism,</v>

223
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>takes a more cold and rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach and meanings plainly that there</v>

224
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:21.534
<v Speaker 1>is no inherent value to existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick and morty takes this to new </v>

225
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:25.764
<v Speaker 1>heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is the universe cold and </v>

226
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>uncaring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of them.</v>

227
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you think matters matters.</v>

228
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.923
<v Speaker 1>This is special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is happening infinite times across </v>

229
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:41.091
<v Speaker 1>infinite realities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including this one brand of contemporary</v>

230
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:42.084
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eliminative materialism would bring joy </v>

231
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>to rick's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This position,</v>

232
00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 1>champion by the husband and wife Tag </v>
<v Speaker 1>Team Patricia and Paul churchland argues</v>

233
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:50.604
<v Speaker 1>that many common sense attitudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherited from modern psychology should </v>

234
00:11:53.481 --> 00:11:54.314
<v Speaker 1>it be dropped in favor of more </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific and empirical notions and in </v>

235
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.684
<v Speaker 1>an ironic twist for a married couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe that notion such as love </v>

236
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 1>should be dismissed as folk psychology.</v>

237
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.613
<v Speaker 1>When you say that you love your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just describing a chemical </v>

238
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>process occurring in the brain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to stimuli,</v>

239
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>or to quote Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people call love.</v>

240
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.073
<v Speaker 1>It's just a chemical reaction to compels</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals to breed and while bojack might </v>

241
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 1>find meaning in is lingering love for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane.</v>

242
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.373
<v Speaker 1>A good eliminativists like rick knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human emotions are fundamentally </v>

243
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>both to the extent that love is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of familiarity.</v>

244
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:27.814
<v Speaker 1>Over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my access to infinite timelines </v>

245
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 1>precludes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Necessity of attachment.</v>

246
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 1>We can also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Beth season three,</v>

247
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>arc in this light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's torn between Jerry and rick on the</v>

248
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure sentimental,</v>

249
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 1>irrational love for a buffoon and on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side with her father,</v>

250
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.543
<v Speaker 1>the kind of cold calculation that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine to replace yourself with an </v>

251
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 1>identical clone and abandoned your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family while you go on space.</v>

252
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make a clone of you,</v>

253
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.423
<v Speaker 1>a perfect instance of you with all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories and exact copy in every way at </v>

254
00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 1>11 provide for the kids.</v>

255
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.853
<v Speaker 1>You could be gone a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week or the rest of your life with </v>

256
00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.194
<v Speaker 1>zero consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if rick had a favorite contemporary </v>

257
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good chance it would be Thomas</v>

258
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.973
<v Speaker 1>Metzinger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike those who assume that the human </v>

259
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:07.834
<v Speaker 1>self is a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all have medsync or argues that </v>

260
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>no such thing has ever existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having a self insight us,</v>

261
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 1>he argues that all we are is a jumbled </v>
<v Speaker 1>network of neurons and chemicals.</v>

262
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.493
<v Speaker 1>The self is just a useful fantasy we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sense of our experience like a </v>

263
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>sort of psychological fairytale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is that you all this,</v>

264
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:30.514
<v Speaker 1>systems that simulate or emulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves for themselves as they're </v>

266
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>listening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if Metzinger is right,</v>

267
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.010
<v Speaker 1>we all have to give up the illusion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity has any real purpose or that we</v>

268
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 1>all have some kind of special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique soul.</v>

269
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.453
<v Speaker 1>As a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty frequently trivializes </v>

270
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:50.530
<v Speaker 1>the self and consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Rick's creations become sentience and</v>

271
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 1>have existential crises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this classic.</v>

272
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 1>What is my purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pass butter.</v>

273
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the club bow and also this </v>
<v Speaker 1>remote override.</v>

275
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

276
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Bypassing override.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

277
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.750
<v Speaker 1>This brand of nihilism can end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounding misanthropic.</v>

278
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>A theme we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh course associate with Rick Push,</v>

279
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:14.614
<v Speaker 1>primary reason for spending time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own grandson is that his stupidity </v>

280
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.520
<v Speaker 1>serves as an intern dimensional cloaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>device for his own genius.</v>

281
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.393
<v Speaker 1>See Rick and morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genius waves get canceled out by </v>

282
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.064
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.463
<v Speaker 1>morty waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This rejection of the self makes cosmic </v>

284
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less prone to ethics.</v>

285
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Then it's artsy cousin existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>

286
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.173
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom so celebrated by the </v>

287
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:42.450
<v Speaker 1>existentialists turns out to be just </v>
<v Speaker 1>another illusion for the cosmic phyliss.</v>

288
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.890
<v Speaker 1>So there isn't anything to ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics.</v>

289
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.590
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's certain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

290
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>And if there is no value on which to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build an ethical system,</v>

291
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 1>then one is free to do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

292
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Whether that means watching TV or </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in the intergalactic arms trade</v>

293
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of hitting your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>arcade,</v>

294
00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.833
<v Speaker 1>sold a gun to a murderer so you can play</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games or turning an entire planet </v>

295
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 1>into monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing yourself,</v>

296
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.043
<v Speaker 1>abandoning your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sitting down for a beer moments </v>

297
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

298
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Cause what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick isn't exactly fumbling for meaning,</v>

299
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but he knows he probably has a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>escapable emotions.</v>

300
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>He might as well just deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

301
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I hate myself.</v>

302
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I think I deserved to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

303
00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:21.744
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though Rick Shirley share some </v>

304
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:24.554
<v Speaker 1>ideas with Bojack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cosmic nihilism makes him a closer </v>

305
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>philosophical relative of rust Cole,</v>

306
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 5>because pole terms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm what's called a pessimist.</v>

307
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.143
<v Speaker 5>We are things that Labor under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>illusion of having a program with total </v>

308
00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:42.240
<v Speaker 5>assurance that we are each some body </v>
<v Speaker 5>weight.</v>

309
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:44.070
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's nobody.</v>

310
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Coincidentally another misanthropic </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>

311
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>part three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Versus Sanchez.</v>

312
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 1>So at this point you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the right nihilism for me?</v>

313
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you find yourself fighting off the </v>

314
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>despair of a shallow and meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

315
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.153
<v Speaker 1>Do you continue to search for purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>and goodness despite your awareness of </v>

316
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 1>this meaninglessness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll be remembered if I win,</v>

317
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.104
<v Speaker 1>an Oscar will be remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what have been my life will </v>

318
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:10.730
<v Speaker 1>have meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

319
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Are Most of your friends and associates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Centene,</v>

320
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.693
<v Speaker 1>animals with important jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might be an existential </v>

321
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love and meaning are possible for you,</v>

322
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but it'll take some hard work without </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee.</v>

323
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.693
<v Speaker 1>So pick up some character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard Sartre or Simone de Beauvoir and </v>

324
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 1>hit the local bistro for some strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocktails and spirited conversation.</v>

325
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.133
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you doubt the inherent meaning of human </v>

326
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:32.564
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel no ethical obligations to </v>

327
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 1>friends or family is your best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bird person?</v>

328
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Well then cosmic nihilism might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best life philosophy you've been waiting</v>

329
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

330
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:43.214
<v Speaker 1>download season one of true detective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and search the dark web for some </v>

331
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.304
<v Speaker 1>nootropic drugs to enhance your rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacities and maybe set up a countdown </v>

332
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 1>clock on your wall to get ready for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventual heat death of our universe.</v>

333
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.013
<v Speaker 1>And if you desire a belief system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>merges poorly written science fiction </v>

334
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:57.554
<v Speaker 1>with an alien base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volcanic cosmology and multi thousand </v>

335
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.880
<v Speaker 1>dollar commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well call Tom Cruise.</v>

336
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And even if you still feel an urge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaning in the world,</v>

337
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.913
<v Speaker 1>spending time with shows like rick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>morty and bojack horseman think give </v>

338
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.393
<v Speaker 1>some insight into how the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications of nihilism look in </v>

339
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:18.770
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither type of nihilism is about giving</v>

340
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 1>up completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather they both offer approaches to</v>

341
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 1>moving forward in a largely uncertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

342
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a cosmic nihilist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a date,</v>

343
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:28.274
<v Speaker 1>this Valentine's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe wait until the third or fourth </v>

344
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 1>date to bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

345

<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned earlier in the video,</v>

348
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:42.860
<v Speaker 1>the idea for this video came from a fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>

349
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:43.694
<v Speaker 1>so I just wanted to take a second to </v>

350
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>address some of the questions that heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask.</v>

351
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Can you guys do the philosophy of wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack?</v>

352
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.470
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the point of what you guys do?</v>

353
00:17:54.471 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have any political beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

354
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.683
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to take a second to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>this through a fan email that </v>

355
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>particularly touched me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is from trevor.</v>

356
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:02.904
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to send an earnest </v>

357
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:04.794
<v Speaker 1>personal note of thanks to wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the thought provoking content and </v>

358
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the wise crack addition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full metal alchemist brotherhood video.</v>

359
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I have lived my adult life without faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any sort.</v>

360
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 1>This video truly put things into </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and articulated thoughts and</v>

361
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:16.194
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to quite </v>

362
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for helping me open my</v>

363
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 1>mind a bit more and respect other points</v>
<v Speaker 1>of view.</v>

364
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes wisecrack meaningful to me.</v>

365
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.153
<v Speaker 1>It's empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's allowing new ideas to be </v>

366
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 1>communicated to people through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they love and ultimately the idea</v>

367
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 1>of seeing life through another person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view and perspectives.</v>

368
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Other opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about for me.</v>
