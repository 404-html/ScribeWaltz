00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet boat jared here,</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.813
<v Speaker 1>season three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode seven of Rick and Morty is one </v>

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>of the darkest and densest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>In less than half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the episode managed to build a rich,</v>

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>complex and utterly dismal political </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>only for the show to summarily dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Still not curious about what might've </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened at that crazy senate up place,</v>

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 2>not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laurie.</v>

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 2>That place will never have any bearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>over our lives ever again,</v>

10
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.063
<v Speaker 1>but in that short time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rick lantis mix up paints a really </v>

11
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>interesting picture of modern politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically as it pertains to hope,</v>

12
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.343
<v Speaker 1>resistance and revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack quick take on </v>

13
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>the ric Lantis Mixup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guessed it,</v>

14
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into that,</v>

15
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:44.864
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank quid for sponsoring this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video quite as a really cool app that </v>

16
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>allows you to collect stickers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cards,</v>

17
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.654
<v Speaker 1>and toys for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Featuring a bunch of the shows we love </v>

18
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>here at wise crack breaking bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure time,</v>

19
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Bob's Burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Trek,</v>

20
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty.</v>

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Think of it like opening up packs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball cards.</v>

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been collecting rick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>morty stickers for about a month now and</v>

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>it's actually amazing how quick they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>to add new stickers.</v>

24
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much the day after a new episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>is released,</v>

25
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:12.914
<v Speaker 1>they have new gifts and stickers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can send to your friends over taxed </v>

26
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>or slap onto images in your camera roll.</v>

27
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is the mailman from </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that says,</v>

28
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:21.800

<v Speaker 1>Thanks a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to the show.</v>

36
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.053
<v Speaker 1>So a quick recap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty go on an adventure to </v>

37
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Atlantis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry.</v>

38
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>That actually doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead we're thrown into the citadel of</v>

39
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Rick's as they rebuild after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic events of the shank.</v>

40
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:53.294
<v Speaker 1>Redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic elections are being held for </v>

41
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>the first time in the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion of the council districts.</v>

42
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.003
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

43
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>The world building in this episode is </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking amazing,</v>

44
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.463
<v Speaker 1>especially in how it cleverly mirrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>our current political climate from a </v>

45
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:10.664
<v Speaker 1>news organization that's only one end </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from CNN that trivializes descent </v>

46
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>in order to maintain the status quo.</v>

47
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

48
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 2>the suspect says the citadels ally built</v>
<v Speaker 2>on lies,</v>

49
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.373
<v Speaker 2>and some others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say appreciate the life you have </v>

50
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 2>because it can always be worse</v>

51
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.173
<v Speaker 1>to an intercity devastated by drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns to a hogwarts that teaches the </v>

52
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised mortise to accept their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot in life.</v>

53
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 2>This is a great adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great adventure.</v>

54
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.513
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely one of the harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives to follow and certainly more </v>

55
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.174
<v Speaker 1>complex than your traditional episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to lay out the many subplots </v>

56
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.403
<v Speaker 1>as follows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evil morty comes to power on a platform </v>

57
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:52.841
<v Speaker 1>of unity and change before revealing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>grander and more totalitarian intentions</v>

58
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>in an illusion to training day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fresh out of the academy police,</v>

59
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>rick has to join a crooked cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morty,</v>

60
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.793
<v Speaker 1>and confront the corrupt underbelly of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the citadel where he is forced to </v>

61
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>confront his ideals and abandoned them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems reminiscent of the ending of La</v>

62
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>confidential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're an idealistic cop,</v>

63
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.174
<v Speaker 1>has to break the rules and kill his </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior undermining the same justice </v>

64
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.704
<v Speaker 1>system he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was protecting a group of orphaned </v>

65
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>morty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set off for an adventure.</v>

66
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.084
<v Speaker 1>I'll last stand by me before sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hopes and dreams into the literal </v>

67
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>trash,</v>

68
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.590
<v Speaker 2>garbage dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand back.</v>

69
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.493
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick is passed over for a promotion and </v>

70
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>realizes he's wasted his life on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>assembly line.</v>

71
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 1>He revolts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his triumph is quickly ruined by the</v>

72
00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Speaker 1>powers that be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all of these cases,</v>

73
00:03:38.361 --> 00:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>we see any kind of political or personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimism for change,</v>

74
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>crushed by a cruel and indifferent </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

75
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.153
<v Speaker 1>This episode really builds off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes that we talked about earlier in </v>

76
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Rick Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sing the stone,</v>

77
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 1>specifically alienation or the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern society is strange as us from the</v>

78
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.470
<v Speaker 1>world and our peers making us all dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

79
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.360
<v Speaker 1>In the case of rick man seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone,</v>

80
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.223
<v Speaker 1>the creature comforts of society turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exciting world of the apocalypse </v>

81
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.000
<v Speaker 1>into a domestic nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we see many versions of the smartest</v>

82
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>man in the universe reduced to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drudgery of modern life and mixed in.</v>

83
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 1>We see signs of a deeply divided </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

84
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 2>The number of displaced mortise is </v>
<v Speaker 2>soaring woolrich rick.</v>

85
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.534
<v Speaker 2>Satisfaction levels are plummeting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the divide between the two groups has </v>

86
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 2>never been whiter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saw that one real quick,</v>

87
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but as evil morty suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a distraction.</v>

88
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.683
<v Speaker 2>Sentidos problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't homeless mortise or outraged </v>

89
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:31.314
<v Speaker 2>drinks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The citadels problem is the rick and </v>

90
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 2>morty is feeding on the citadels deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real divide,</v>

91
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.043
<v Speaker 2>the rich versus the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a divide between Rick's and </v>

92
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.313
<v Speaker 2>mortise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The division IC is between the bricks </v>

93
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>and mortars that liked the citadel </v>
<v Speaker 2>divided and the rest of us.</v>

94
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is</v>

95
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>that despite the apparent ruling class </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Rick's,</v>

96
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>everyone is a big thing.</v>

97
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Some of alienation told us we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>special because we were rick,</v>

98
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 2>but they stripped us of everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made us unique.</v>

99
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.693
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't sound like brick work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't come to the citadel to be a </v>

100
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 2>plumber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>

101
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Even the cops are like into just workers</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the assembly line of Justice.</v>

102
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Speaker 2>We know how you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working just like you,</v>

103
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>but our assembly line is justice,</v>

104
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>but in addition to being victims of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those individuals in power,</v>

105
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the rics are also victims of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable system,</v>

106
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and here's where my favorite part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole app</v>

107
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 3>episode comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is simple rick,</v>

108
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.393
<v Speaker 3>but he's no dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He realized long ago that the greatest </v>

109
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 3>thing he'd ever create was his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We captured that moment.</v>

110
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.853
<v Speaker 3>We run it on a loop through simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>rick's mind and the chemical that makes </v>

111
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 3>his brains to create goes into every </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple rick simple wafers,</v>

112
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:36.964
<v Speaker 3>wafer cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come home to the impossible flavor of </v>

113
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 3>your own completion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come home to simple rick's.</v>

114
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.273
<v Speaker 1>This gets at a really smart question </v>
<v Speaker 1>tackled by a lot of different </v>

115
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:46.904
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll summarize the issue as this is </v>

116
00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:51.980
<v Speaker 1>our escape from the alienation of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

117
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Just strengthening the foundations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system that drives that alienation.</v>

118
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.523
<v Speaker 1>Simple follows what I'll call beat Ron </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson trope someone who fights are </v>

119
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:02.504
<v Speaker 1>fast paced world by slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with their hands and spending </v>

120
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>time with the family and a world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>crams us into cubicles and hunches.</v>

121
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>US over assembly lines are only respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the simple life running away from the</v>

122
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>urban clamor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living off the land,</v>

123
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>learning a trade like woodworking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconnecting with your family,</v>

124
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly,</v>

125
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:22.724
<v Speaker 1>this kind of idea gained prevalence as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was industrialized and </v>

126
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:26.234
<v Speaker 1>subsequently corporatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw the rise of organizations like </v>

127
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.684
<v Speaker 1>the boy scouts and the establishment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>national parks where you could practice </v>

128
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>not being crammed in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could be argued that this escaped</v>

129
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>the simple life.</v>

130
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Whether in the form of nature or family </v>
<v Speaker 1>or woodworking is not in fact retreating</v>

131
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:43.154
<v Speaker 1>from the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an essential part of its </v>

132
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:45.854
<v Speaker 1>functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can view these simple rick wafers </v>

133
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.524
<v Speaker 1>brand as a kind of fantasy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforces the system rick show up for </v>

134
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.054
<v Speaker 1>work because they know they can go home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and allegedly unplugged from the system </v>

135
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>with the distilled essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplicity.</v>

136
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Even though this unplugging comes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>commodity form,</v>

137
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.193
<v Speaker 1>one that requires you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that you have to work for at an </v>

138
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:07.034
<v Speaker 1>assembly line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've all seen enough cereal </v>

139
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>commercials to know that advertisers </v>
<v Speaker 1>love selling us a kind of pure,</v>

140
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:13.334
<v Speaker 1>wholesome family who actually eats meals</v>
<v Speaker 1>together without screaming at each </v>

141
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sociologists,</v>

142
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:22.181
<v Speaker 1>George Ritter says that our enchantment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and disenchantment from the modern world</v>

143
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>are not so easy to distinguish from each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

144
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>He says they exist and a reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

145
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.713
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fantasy of unplugging with some </v>

146
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.274
<v Speaker 1>simple rick wafers further entrenches </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the very system you want to </v>

147
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>unplug from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gets even more devious.</v>

148
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>As one rick decides he's had enough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engages in an actual act of rebellion,</v>

149
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.353
<v Speaker 1>killing his boss and trying to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal gun to actually escape the </v>

150
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of affecting change,</v>

151
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>his rebellion is commodified in the form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the simple rick.</v>

152
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.284
<v Speaker 1>Freedom wafers selects come home to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique flavor of shattering the grand </v>

153
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He endlessly lives the joy of rebellion.</v>

154
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>While the system distills this joy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumable form,</v>

155
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>freedom from the system in traps you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

156
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Richard goes onto say that fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop people into the new means of </v>

157
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.394
<v Speaker 1>consumption and those fantasies can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalized in order to further draw </v>

158
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:17.264
<v Speaker 1>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this for me makes this the darkest </v>

159
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:20.894
<v Speaker 1>episode of the season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet the message seems to be in the </v>

160
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>terrifying political reality that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

161
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>The best we can hope for is the illusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making a difference.</v>

162
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the orphan mortise plot.</v>

163
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.933
<v Speaker 1>They go on a coming of age adventure </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to escape their terrible orphan </v>

164
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>existence and their bondage to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>future rick,</v>

165
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>but the wish portal turns out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage portal.</v>

166
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>The system turns wishes into literal </v>
<v Speaker 1>trash,</v>

167
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.493
<v Speaker 1>slick morty sacrifices himself to wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a better world and it happens sort </v>

168
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>of holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slicks wish came true.</v>

169
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're meant to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his sacrifice magically made things</v>

170
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.084
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because the change promised </v>

171
00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 1>was just a ploy by evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morty.</v>

172
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>The subplot has no actual bearing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall narrative.</v>

173
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.673
<v Speaker 1>It only seems to exist for the riders to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show us the naive ideas of these </v>

174
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>children that slick morty sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have changed something.</v>

175
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing they did mattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they get to believe it did just like</v>

176
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.570
<v Speaker 1>are revolting rick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we make of evil?</v>

177
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.013
<v Speaker 1>He sold a kind of class consciousness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rics and mores of the citadel that </v>

178
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.364
<v Speaker 1>bricks and mortar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should join together to make a </v>

179
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:28.284
<v Speaker 1>better world against the ruling elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with the brutal purge of his </v>

180
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>political opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this was nothing more than</v>

181
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>lip service as a means to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

182
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>could we really expect any kind of real </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress from this show?</v>

183
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>There's just so much going on in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode that we haven't touched on.</v>

184
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.743
<v Speaker 1>Like is there some connection between </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Latin phrase on the chalkboard and </v>

185
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:49.764
<v Speaker 1>evil mortise view of how society </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions will discuss this as well as </v>
