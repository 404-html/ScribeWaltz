00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>The high roll in style that's portrayed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on television is basically a dream,</v>

2
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>meaning that if you have a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can happen,</v>

3
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>it could come true and in a way it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for kids to see that.</v>

4
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times I feel like art,</v>

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.643
<v Speaker 1>if you tell it the high rollers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the story should start from the </v>

6
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>rags to riches because when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a sense and it makes sense.</v>

7
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of just flossing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.543
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and millions of dollars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then jumping on a plane and then a boat </v>

9
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>and the kids really think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>it's your boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>what I've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because let me tell you something.</v>

12
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>This is what I've learned through my </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

13
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>The people with the real money don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff.</v>

14
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.523
<v Speaker 1>Nine Times out of 10 they're in a room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even know who they are unless </v>

15
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:06.814
<v Speaker 1>you hear people talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing about it is when you've </v>

16
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>seen all this high rolling in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

17
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you what a ty Cohen </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

18
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>tycoon has billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tycoon said,</v>

19
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>why clef?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's funny about you guys?</v>

20
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Y'All want to be us and we want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and that's the best way to explain</v>

21
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
