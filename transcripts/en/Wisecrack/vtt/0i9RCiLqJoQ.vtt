00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Well dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>is uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>they have particularly these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>even physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fun people because of the power</v>

5
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>of medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are living much longer.</v>

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>They're living longer and accumulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>more burden of disease often.</v>

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>And so they're dying in more pain than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than people,</v>

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early part of the last century.</v>

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying over prolonged periods of time.</v>

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the inherently human </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain,</v>

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>existential pain of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dying,</v>

12
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.433
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of part and parcel of the human </v>

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we are able to contemplate</v>

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>our life and the meaning of our life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be so articulate within ourselves and</v>

16
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>between people in the love that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>for one another,</v>

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposes a downside of,</v>

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>of knowing in such detail the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the extent of our losses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling,</v>

20
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally,</v>

21
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>the pain of losing people that we love </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing people for whom are,</v>

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.333
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most important things of our </v>

24
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:19.064
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>around whom our life revolves.</v>

26
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>The notion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>where am I going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens after I'm not here?</v>

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.333
<v Speaker 1>There is a great deal of pain in having </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived and contemplating non life for </v>

29
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is we,</v>

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>even those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.873
<v Speaker 1>most pure existentialists who </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate nonexistence and don't </v>

32
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>believe in God or an afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>feel the pain of nonexistence beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>this life.</v>

34
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>But if you ask them to contemplate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>time before they were born,</v>

35
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>it has not nearly the amount of angst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.383
<v Speaker 1>existence before we were here has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has none of the emotional charge of </v>

37
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>existential annihilation beyond this </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

38
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
