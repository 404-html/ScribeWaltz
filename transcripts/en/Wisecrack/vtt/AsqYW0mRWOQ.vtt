7
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:23.681
<v Speaker 1>Jared again here to ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are a repetitive Sitcom intro and an</v>

8
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:24.724
<v Speaker 1>Ode to British Children's television?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two of the most disturbing things on </v>

9
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:28.834
<v Speaker 1>youtube besides the obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a reason that this or this is </v>

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.783
<v Speaker 1>more unsettling than say a dude who </v>
<v Speaker 1>murders you in your dreams instead of </v>

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 1>cheap jump scares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks and don't hug me.</v>

12
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared into a kind of existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror,</v>

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.743
<v Speaker 1>but two different ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've ever pondered the eternal </v>

14
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.134
<v Speaker 1>question of whether you'd rather be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in a song that never ends or an </v>

15
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>acid induced muppet nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this is the video for you.</v>

16
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack condition on too</v>
<v Speaker 1>many cooks versus don't hug me.</v>

17
00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess spoilers ahead.</v>

18
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a quick recap.</v>

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks begins like the opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>credits of most 80 sitcoms,</v>

20
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.780
<v Speaker 1>like full house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different strokes or my two dads,</v>

21
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and then just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the jingle repeats,</v>

22
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:13.964
<v Speaker 1>the opening credits mutate and begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resemble things ranging from Gi Joe to </v>

23
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Battlestar Galactica and it keeps going</v>

24
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 2>and going and going,</v>

25
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>and a serial killer shows up and look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen it,</v>

26
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>go watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

27
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared as a six episode web series </v>

28
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>that resembles British children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>television shows like the teletubbies,</v>

29
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but each episode quickly descends into </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying psychological torture,</v>

30
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.623
<v Speaker 1>complete with cultish fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This embezzlement and uncomfortable </v>

31
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:48.314
<v Speaker 1>amounts of raw meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they don't seem terribly </v>

32
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.314
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both utilize a special nightmare sauce </v>

33
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:54.314
<v Speaker 1>that really gets under our skin that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauce king with nostalgia in too many </v>

34
00:01:58.881 --> 00:01:59.714
<v Speaker 1>cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aesthetic of the comforting TV </v>

35
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>families of the eighties and nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite literally murdered while in.</v>

36
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

37
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Our childhood mentors are inverted into </v>
<v Speaker 1>orwellian despots,</v>

38
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>but what makes this worse than say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching nightmare.</v>

39
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:14.894
<v Speaker 1>On Elm Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see nostalgia offers three </v>

40
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.804
<v Speaker 1>psychological benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It acts as a repository for positive </v>

41
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contributor to self esteem,</v>

42
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and as a method of social connectivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>because who hasn't read all 52 ways,</v>

43
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you know you're a nineties kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since nostalgia makes us feel so good,</v>

44
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.383
<v Speaker 1>disrupting it can really mess with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head according to one school of thought </v>

45
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:36.494
<v Speaker 1>called terror management theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia can be a handy way to combat </v>

46
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>the terror of our mortal existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer able to take comfort in God or</v>

47
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>an afterlife.</v>

48
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Our secular age has put more emphasis on</v>
<v Speaker 1>other kinds of immortality,</v>

49
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>like having kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making your mark on the world,</v>

50
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>having a national identity or having </v>
<v Speaker 1>your Dick cast and plaster.</v>

51
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>This is where nostalgia comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At 2006,</v>

52
00:02:58.551 --> 00:02:59.384
<v Speaker 1>study found nostalgia helps to provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning in our lives by allowing us to </v>

53
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>relive idealized memories of our past in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to feel better about the future,</v>

54
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.493
<v Speaker 1>but unlike some media that shamelessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>parrots nostalgia to give us the warm </v>

55
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and fuzzies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks and don't hug me.</v>

56
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:14.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using this to log references to draw us </v>

57
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:17.554
<v Speaker 1>in and then give us a good old fashioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind rather than dressing up like </v>

58
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>ghostbusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks and don't hug me.</v>

59
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Identify with these references to the </v>

60
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>point of absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use the sappy intro music.</v>

61
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.234
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks dated retro graphics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple puppets with bright colors to </v>

62
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:37.924
<v Speaker 1>pull you into a nostalgic state and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>under my so when everything goes to </v>

63
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're literally ruining your childhood</v>

64
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>and not like the last jet I did.</v>

65
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.063
<v Speaker 1>The nostalgic fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good memories that pacify you on your </v>

66
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.124
<v Speaker 1>meaningless trudge toward death are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>being murdered both metaphorically and </v>

67
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.073
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while both these properties utilize </v>

68
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:58.804
<v Speaker 1>this subversion of nostalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how and why they subverted that </v>

69
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>sets them apart to understand what sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many cooks apart from.</v>

70
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

71
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>We need to look at the Early Twentieth </v>
<v Speaker 1>Century Theater Practitioner,</v>

72
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Bertolt Brecht,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brecht rejected realism and theater.</v>

73
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Arguing that because film was so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at it,</v>

74
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>why even bother theater doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>endless takes multiple locations,</v>

75
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:21.634
<v Speaker 1>camera angles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perfectly mixed audio that puts you </v>

76
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.394
<v Speaker 1>in the moment the way cinema does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theater requires a lot of suspension of </v>

77
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:28.354
<v Speaker 1>disbelief and audience imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so breck developed what he called epic </v>

78
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.914
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Epic theater sought to disrupt the </v>

79
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.524
<v Speaker 1>audience performer relationship where </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional drama expected an audience </v>

80
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.514
<v Speaker 1>to be sad when the protagonist is sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened when he or she is frightened </v>

81
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

82
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.523
<v Speaker 1>Brecht wanted an audience to view the </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance more critically and </v>

83
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>dispassionately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do that,</v>

84
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>he used a technique called distantiation</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the alienation effect.</v>

85
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.793
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would show the workings of their </v>

86
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>performance on stage to reveal its </v>
<v Speaker 1>falseness in his play,</v>

87
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>mother courage and her children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costume changes happen on stage.</v>

88
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.823
<v Speaker 1>Props and scenery are brought on and off</v>
<v Speaker 1>during dialog and placards are held up </v>

89
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>to explain the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

90
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.064
<v Speaker 1>the audience can't escape the awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were watching a play and thus </v>

91
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>are able to judge the characters more </v>
<v Speaker 1>critically.</v>

92
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Old birdie basically patented our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture's favorite thing,</v>

93
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.563
<v Speaker 1>breaking the fourth wall like Brecht.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks draws our attention to </v>

94
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:23.704
<v Speaker 1>its own falseness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters run between sets that are </v>

95
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:26.754
<v Speaker 1>stocked by their Chiron's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audio and video are disrupted and </v>

96
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another characteristic.</v>

97
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks shares with Brecht is </v>
<v Speaker 1>repetition.</v>

98
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.193
<v Speaker 1>In almost every Brecht play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a form of repeated dance </v>

99
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gesture or phrase,</v>

100
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>even in the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider the Alabama sauce,</v>

101
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>which you might recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome song by the doors.</v>

102
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brecht wrote the lyrics.</v>

103
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Rhythm and instrumentation are highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>repetitive and the harmony uses a lot of</v>

104
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.054
<v Speaker 1>dissonance to achieve the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of creepiness on bestows upon </v>

105
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.084
<v Speaker 1>the listener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you two are creeped out by the </v>

106
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then congrats,</v>

107
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Brex alienation effect work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you repeat something,</v>

108
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to look at or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to it critically.</v>

109
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.843
<v Speaker 1>Seeing it a different way like have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever repeated a word until it sounds </v>

110
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>like gibberish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like saying,</v>

111
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>pigeon pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeon,</v>

112
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:17.834
<v Speaker 1>pigeon for a minute straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll make the word pigeon sound </v>

113
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>extremely weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hearing the phrase,</v>

114
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.543
<v Speaker 1>too many cooks over and over throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 11 minute video will remove any and </v>

115
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>all meaning the phrase too many cooks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had,</v>

116
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.503
<v Speaker 1>but were Brecht would often use this </v>
<v Speaker 1>distancing effect to explain an </v>

117
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>injustice or challenge or prejudice.</v>

118
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks has a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic view of the whole thing.</v>

119
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Every component of popular entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 1>is distance and robbed of meaning.</v>

120
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the repetitiveness of the phrase,</v>

121
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.074
<v Speaker 1>too many cooks spoil the broth seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel the repetition of other Sitcom </v>

122
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 1>catchphrases like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

123
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>even as more and more unsettling </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements are introduced,</v>

124
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>the repetition renders it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless and uses this opportunity to</v>

125
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>show how interchangeable at all is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>our characters get murdered are greasy.</v>

126
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.954
<v Speaker 1>Serial killer begins to inhabit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>generic and interchangeable tropes and </v>

127
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:09.584
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics of television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By deconstructing these old shows in </v>

128
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>this graphic way too many cooks up ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any attempt at terror management through</v>

129
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.324
<v Speaker 1>our nostalgic love of he-man married </v>
<v Speaker 1>with children or buck rogers by </v>

130
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.044
<v Speaker 1>revealing them to be empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily replicated junk all for a joke </v>

131
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and a great one at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me,</v>

132
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:27.884
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use this a lot of these same techniques </v>

133
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:30.344
<v Speaker 1>of distantiation to like breaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth wall by rotating a digital image </v>

134
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>of their set and repeating camera moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dialogue over and over.</v>

135
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what will happen,</v>

136
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

137
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>don't hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

138
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Has more in common with a different type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pop culture deconstruction.</v>

139
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Whereas too many cooks is deconstruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>for its own sake.</v>

140
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subverts nostalgia too.</v>

141
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Not only criticized children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

142
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but to offer a way forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how exactly.</v>

143
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first we need to talk about something </v>

144
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>that sounds really boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British television act of 1954,</v>

145
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.343
<v Speaker 1>which allowed commercial television </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks to compete with the publicly </v>

146
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>owned BBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Following the television act,</v>

147
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.313
<v Speaker 1>a new commercial channel called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Independent Television was created in </v>

148
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>1955.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fact not lost on.</v>

149
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.064
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared in the Erie fundraising </v>

150
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trailers,</v>

151
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.233
<v Speaker 1>a violent bear monster demands money </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the audience using a ransom video </v>

152
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>conspicuously timestamp as 1955.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this in mind,</v>

153
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>the reason for deconstructing children's</v>
<v Speaker 1>television becomes a bit clearer.</v>

154
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Subtle clues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take jabs at the very idea of children's</v>

155
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>television for profit or even profit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general throughout it's six episodes.</v>

156
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>The three main characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red guy,</v>

157
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>duck and yellow guy are terrorized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>different guest teachers,</v>

158
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 1>like a notebook that explains </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

159
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>What's your favorite ice is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

160
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.493
<v Speaker 1>a clock that explains time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time is a tool you can put on the wall </v>

161
00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:04.520
<v Speaker 1>or wherever it on your wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The past is far behind us.</v>

162
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.250
<v Speaker 1>The future doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nap Ap,</v>

163
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.080
<v Speaker 1>that explains love for some reason.</v>

164
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 4>Together we get understanding</v>

165
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.250
<v Speaker 1>on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seems like any episode of Barney or</v>

166
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.143
<v Speaker 1>whatever kids watch these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the fourth wall starts to </v>

167
00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:20.380
<v Speaker 1>dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything gets weird.</v>

168
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Herder is trippy and even profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One could argue that this bat,</v>

169
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.883
<v Speaker 1>it insanity and the unexpected guys have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kids show is been to expose the </v>

170
00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:30.124
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian and consumerists messages </v>
<v Speaker 1>using a method known as culture jamming </v>

171
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.163
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamming is a tactic used by anti </v>

172
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:37.434
<v Speaker 1>consumer as groups to subvert the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant narrative and iconography of </v>

173
00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:41.104
<v Speaker 1>our era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media advertisements and so </v>

174
00:09:43.481 --> 00:09:45.610
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means revealing the message that is</v>

175
00:09:45.611 --> 00:09:46.444
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really behind popular media and </v>

176
00:09:48.071 --> 00:09:51.770
<v Speaker 1>advertising and injecting their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to serve their agenda.</v>

177
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I think of the coke billboard that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

178
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but someone spray painted profit </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it,</v>

179
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.500
<v Speaker 1>or a Mcdonald's billboard modified to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

180
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm loving diabetes or anything banks </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ever done or vermin supreme,</v>

181
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.103
<v Speaker 1>a man who wears a boot on his head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to mandate brushing your teeth by </v>

182
00:10:08.321 --> 00:10:10.900
<v Speaker 1>law all to mark our political process.</v>

183
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.620
<v Speaker 4>This election year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vote early,</v>

184
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.110
<v Speaker 4>vote often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember a vote for me,</v>

185
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.310
<v Speaker 4>vermin supreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about completely thrown away.</v>

186
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.253
<v Speaker 1>This method of deconstructing a well </v>
<v Speaker 1>known institution like children's </v>

187
00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:21.424
<v Speaker 1>television by jamming it with another </v>
<v Speaker 1>more graphic image highlights the </v>

188
00:10:24.551 --> 00:10:25.384
<v Speaker 1>disparity between wholesome edutainment </v>
<v Speaker 1>for kids and the excesses of profit </v>

189
00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Speaker 1>driven media that the television act </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced throughout the series.</v>

190
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.540
<v Speaker 1>The teachers in every episode explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>what something is or means,</v>

191
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.360
<v Speaker 1>but start to suggest better ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things.</v>

192
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Could you're not thinking creatively</v>

193
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main characters.</v>

194
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not by name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can do it.</v>

195
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did,</v>

196
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>and punish them if they do or say what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the teachers see as the wrong thing.</v>

197
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Wanting to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't use green.</v>

198
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.750
<v Speaker 1>That's not a creative color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

199
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Eat fancy foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

200
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 1>They'll clog up your body.</v>

201
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Ten feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Foods are very rude.</v>

202
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 4>I must leave through the cat flap.</v>

203
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.203
<v Speaker 1>While these choices of excluding green </v>
<v Speaker 1>or choosing a computer over a globe to </v>

204
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.080
<v Speaker 1>learn may seem inane and meaningless at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

205
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.660
<v Speaker 1>they slowly begin to reveal what is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>stake.</v>

206
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.643
<v Speaker 1>These saccharin notion of a child's TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor is jammed to reveal the dangers </v>

207
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:28.384
<v Speaker 1>of letting media teacher child in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh realities of the commercial age </v>

208
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.523
<v Speaker 1>and the touch of authoritarianism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is inherent to it all attempts to </v>

209
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:37.750
<v Speaker 1>question their teachers are always shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

210
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.440
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just.</v>

211
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.180
<v Speaker 4>A construct of human perception and </v>
<v Speaker 4>illusion created by.</v>

212
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.823
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the danger of empty platitudes about </v>

213
00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:52.160
<v Speaker 1>love devolve into a cult.</v>

214
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.263
<v Speaker 4>His name is</v>

215
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.160
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get loud.</v>

216
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.133
<v Speaker 1>Optimism about technology is juxtaposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some clockwork orange in the </v>

217
00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:01.304
<v Speaker 1>computer episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do with a computer seems to be </v>

218
00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:07.490
<v Speaker 1>dancing graphs and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>style as in,</v>

219
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying clothes.</v>

220
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.213
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

221
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.993
<v Speaker 1>The last few episodes even seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop hints that this is all a plan to </v>

222
00:12:19.581 --> 00:12:20.414
<v Speaker 1>sell oats to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our computer teacher asks the puppets a </v>

223
00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:23.834
<v Speaker 1>series of questions like it's for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus group and on the question of what </v>

224
00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:27.464
<v Speaker 1>do you like to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our beloved computer shows us another </v>

225
00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:31.790
<v Speaker 1>picture of oats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the next episode,</v>

226
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Our teacher tells us the merits of plain</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods and more oats are seen next to the</v>

227
00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:37.610
<v Speaker 1>healthy juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This gives.</v>

228
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

229
00:12:38.661 --> 00:12:39.494
<v Speaker 1>A much more moral message than too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooks while too many cooks literally </v>

230
00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:44.660
<v Speaker 1>self destructs the message of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hug me.</v>

231
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

232
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.780
<v Speaker 1>alternate methods of childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

233
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.763
<v Speaker 1>Try managing your terror with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like almost everything else in pop </v>

234
00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 1>culture right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many cooks and don't hug me.</v>

235
00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:54.644
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognize how we use nostalgia as a </v>

236
00:12:56.481 --> 00:13:00.690
<v Speaker 1>safety blanket and then soak that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blanket in blood and rip a few holes in,</v>

237
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.843
<v Speaker 1>but while too many cooks says that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this kind of nostalgic is a lie </v>

238
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:06.260
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately useless.</v>

239
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't hug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

240
00:13:07.491 --> 00:13:08.324
