1
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.530
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared,</v>

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get into it,</v>

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:06.774
<v Speaker 1>just a note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't do a quick take last week </v>

4
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>while the world early conspiracy was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our favorite episodes of the season,</v>

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really have much to add to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>but we're back to take on season three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode six,</v>

8
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>where we'll be looking at the toxic side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our favorite adventuring duo.</v>

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I really love this episode for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.103
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they manage to address the kind of </v>

11
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:26.964
<v Speaker 1>character development we crave in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's both satisfying and the exact </v>

12
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what regular TV does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

13
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>they tap into some really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about mental health.</v>

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So fire your therapist and join me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this quick take of rest and relaxation.</v>

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.473
<v Speaker 1>A quick recap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty need a break from almost </v>

16
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>dying all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was insane.</v>

17
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.243
<v Speaker 1>That was pure luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not in control of that situation </v>

18
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:50.484
<v Speaker 1>at all</v>

19
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>and come to the realization that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned out.</v>

20
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.493
<v Speaker 1>So they vacation at an alien spa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a mental detoxifier for a spin </v>

21
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.413
<v Speaker 1>while the dual fuel cleanse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenated they leave behind the parts </v>

22
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:03.954
<v Speaker 1>they hate most about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morning continues to live his life </v>

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.433
<v Speaker 1>without these sense of crippling self </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt becomes the most popular kid in </v>

24
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>school and even lands a date with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessica.</v>

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick seems like a normal human being.</v>

26
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.393
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this new reality is interrupted as </v>

27
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:20.184
<v Speaker 1>the toxic versions of themselves managed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape and turn the whole world a </v>

28
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>weird as we praise our loving father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>July,</v>

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.933
<v Speaker 1>we made them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the cleverest aspects of this </v>

30
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>episode is what I'm going to call anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>character development.</v>

31
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
<v Speaker 1>As we've mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Harmon is a strict adherence to his </v>

32
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>version of Joseph Campbell's the hero's </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

33
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relevant part here is that many </v>

34
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>stories use protagonists confronting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their shadow.</v>

35
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.303
<v Speaker 1>It kind of dark reflection of themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they must overcome like Dr Jekyll </v>

36
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>and Mr Hyde in terms of character </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

37
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>This overcoming usually means arch euro </v>
<v Speaker 1>has some new insight on life,</v>

38
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.823
<v Speaker 1>like when a compassionate Logan </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices himself battling the </v>

39
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>murderous x 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming his selfishness,</v>

40
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.843
<v Speaker 1>or when Luke Skywalker's spares darth </v>
<v Speaker 1>vader overcoming his temptation toward </v>

41
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.104
<v Speaker 1>the dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode uses this structure toxic </v>

42
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:13.494
<v Speaker 1>Mourdian toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick are quite literal shadow versions </v>

43
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:16.554
<v Speaker 1>of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of overcoming their toxic </v>

44
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.494
<v Speaker 1>personality traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this episode is a journey to reunite </v>

45
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>with their worst selves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

46
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.663
<v Speaker 1>Healthy morty is a smooth operator with </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of friends who ultimately needs to </v>

47
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>rediscover his self-loathing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

48
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Ric is a thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super genius who needs to rediscover his</v>

49
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>narcissism and irrational care for </v>
<v Speaker 1>morty.</v>

50
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.443
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regular kind of character </v>

51
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:41.634
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally I would come down on any kind </v>

52
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.094
<v Speaker 1>of disruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to represent a positive </v>

53
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>change for your character is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy,</v>

54
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.703
<v Speaker 1>but I also think this anti character </v>
<v Speaker 1>development serves as a pretty smart </v>

55
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>commentary on mental health in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

56
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.213
<v Speaker 1>Rest and Rick laxation asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be mentally word </v>

57
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>around school as you've become super </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy?</v>

58
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.453
<v Speaker 1>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this episode serves as an extended </v>

59
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>parody of certain healthy attitudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted by self help Gurus,</v>

60
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.993
<v Speaker 1>popular media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the occasional life purpose </v>

61
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>cheerleader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear they exist in La.</v>

62
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Focus on the good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

63
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>

64
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.454
<v Speaker 1>this idea that we must strive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate any thoughts that are </v>

65
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant or painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag positive vibes.</v>

66
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag selfcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag blessed Hashtag.</v>

67
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:26.314
<v Speaker 1>Sorry dot sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are a ton of installation </v>

68
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.044
<v Speaker 1>tools will tell you that being mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy means uncritically loving </v>

69
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying yes to everything,</v>

70
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>counting your blessings and believing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

71
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>no matter how stupid your passive income</v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme is.</v>

72
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.653
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick and morty shows us that these </v>

73
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>ideals fully embodied will make you seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a coked out Weirdo.</v>

74
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so quiet.</v>

75
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you tell me about yourself?</v>

76
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>What's the atmosphere like on Planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessica?</v>

77
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the ideas of the show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting at is something sociologists,</v>

78
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>William Davies has written about in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book the happiness industry.</v>

79
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.353
<v Speaker 1>For our longtime fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually talked about this book and </v>

80
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.114
<v Speaker 1>our inside out video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demis writes about a concept he calls </v>

81
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.324
<v Speaker 1>compulsory happiness that in our modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>world there exists a kind of alliance </v>

82
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>between corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managers,</v>

83
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:11.254
<v Speaker 1>and advertisers to promote a definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mental health that ultimately serves </v>

84
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>the capitalist society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we live in a kind of happiness that</v>

85
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>involves cheerfully accepting the status</v>
<v Speaker 1>quo.</v>

86
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Something touched on by rick before </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't respect therapy.</v>

87
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's helped a lot of people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and start panicking,</v>

88
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.383
<v Speaker 1>which is a state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We value in the animals who eat this </v>

89
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>kind of happiness also requires constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>self improvement for the sake of being a</v>

90
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>better consumer.</v>

91
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's work off your trauma with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>urban spin yoga.</v>

92
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do yoga on a bike,</v>

93
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but you have an at risk preteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can just blow this off.</v>

94
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.093
<v Speaker 1>Morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see morty spouting platitudes that </v>

95
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>seemed lifted from a Tony Robbins book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love drums.</v>

96
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I never took drum lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

97
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Limitations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are addicted to our own limitations.</v>

98
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.924
<v Speaker 1>How amazing is that demanding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone around him partake in his new </v>

99
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do this detox thing.</v>

100
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an alien spa?</v>

101
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.063
<v Speaker 1>You go through it and when confronted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with real life problems like a scented </v>

102
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>part of himself being trapped in hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his answer is,</v>

103
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are good.</v>

104
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Taking that away from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't be healthy.</v>

105
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.783
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this is that many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things the self help industry wants </v>

106
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you to erase like self doubt and sadness</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty important.</v>

107
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.823
<v Speaker 1>In the case of Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can hold you back from becoming a </v>

108
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:23.524
<v Speaker 1>full on sociopath and a sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He becomes in a scene lifted from the </v>

109
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>wolf of Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like healthy.</v>

110
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Morty is at the top of his game as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unscrupulous stockbroker,</v>

111
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:34.783
<v Speaker 1>handholds biotech million and a half at </v>
<v Speaker 1>33 with a new hot redhead to replace </v>

112
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.524
<v Speaker 1>Jessica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick even compares him to another </v>

113
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.440
<v Speaker 1>sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much self esteem.</v>

114
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny American psycho.</v>

115
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.323
<v Speaker 1>So what about rick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick realizes some of these less </v>

116
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.384
<v Speaker 1>desirable parts of ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the pain they caused are </v>

117
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>essential to actually being healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the healthy thing,</v>

118
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.414
<v Speaker 1>and voluntarily read toxify yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessica even tells marty good to have </v>

119
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.894
<v Speaker 1>you back suggesting them mortise </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic self hating self is truly his </v>

120
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:07.784
<v Speaker 1>better self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my only complaint with this episode </v>

121
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really make sense.</v>

123
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>We're meant to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>undesirable parts of a person are purged</v>

124
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>from their being based on their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective definition of toxicity.</v>

125
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>How could that detox machine know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between healthy and sick?</v>

126
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>For everything that goes through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't.</v>

127
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>It must be by the individual's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of toxicity.</v>

128
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Yet healthy rig says this to morty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm real proud to be your grandpa.</v>

129
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Morning then later claims that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment to morty is irrational,</v>

130
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>therefore toxic and allows him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonchalantly do this.</v>

131
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>So is his love for morty toxic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

132
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
