1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of factors that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida weird.</v>

2
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.783
<v Speaker 1>It is not like any other state that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of in the sense that there is no </v>

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>there is Miami where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Latin America.</v>

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend anytime in way Emma,</v>

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>you will discover that not only is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America,</v>

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's more and more Latin America </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

10
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go south into the keys,</v>

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>it's the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go west to Naples,</v>

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>it's Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>if you go north to boca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's long island.</v>

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

15
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian limousine drivers driving,</v>

16
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tourists from everywhere in the world </v>

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>all around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go much north of that,</v>

18
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>it becomes Georgia and Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is really not.</v>

19
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>One state has no coherence at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>and I think less so as the time goes by.</v>

21
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.813
<v Speaker 1>It's a vacation spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have people coming down there </v>

22
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.154
<v Speaker 1>just to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few people who are not feeling it </v>

23
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>necessarily in a serious mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

24
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a very transient state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a lot of people,</v>

25
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't,</v>

26
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.153
<v Speaker 1>don't feel rooted there but are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because it's convenient or the </v>

27
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>weather's nice or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

29
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty corrupt state.</v>

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had a lot of corruption in Florida</v>

31
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's convenient to uh,</v>

32
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of borders.</v>

33
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's very easy to get there from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean,</v>

34
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>from Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

35
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanted to smuggle something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida is a great place to start.</v>

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.843
<v Speaker 1>So the result of this is it's just kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this very loose during non </v>

37
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nontraditional state where anything</v>

38
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.344
<v Speaker 1>feels like it could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like if you made Las Vegas </v>

39
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>much bigger and with less controls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.523
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the efficiency of the casinos and </v>

41
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.053
<v Speaker 1>the Las Vegas police department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as kind of a big area where people </v>

42
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>feel they can do things.</v>

43
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And so people come from everywhere to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to party to do whatever to do,</v>

44
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>commit to commit criminal acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the weather's warm.</v>

45
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>So you can always be outside and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

46
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>there's always a party going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

47
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just conducive to weird things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

48
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>My argument has been for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are not,</v>

49
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.453
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much floridians who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird and I consider myself when I've </v>

50
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>been there 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's people come to Florida.</v>

52
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>We are like the Ellis Island for weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid people.</v>

53
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>They come to come to Florida to commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid acts.</v>

54
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

55
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one example I like to use,</v>

56
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got an international,</v>

57
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>a publicity woman was arrested driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>south on the overseas highway from Miami</v>

58
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>to key to key west a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

59
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>she had an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>because she was shaving her bikini </v>
<v Speaker 1>region while a while driving.</v>

61
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she actually had an outsourced the </v>

62
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>steering to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her passenger.</v>

63
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>She was in a hurry to see her boyfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>in key west.</v>

64
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>This is all according to the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

65
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she said he'd rather than pull over </v>

66
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>to the side of the road to shave her </v>
<v Speaker 1>bikini region,</v>

67
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>she keep going and outsource the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>steering to a passenger who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it happened.</v>

69
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And this is where it's a Florida story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her ex husband.</v>

70
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're driving south 40 miles an hour,</v>

71
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>she's shaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not looking at the road,</v>

72
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>just operating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate your steering into what could</v>

73
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.590
<v Speaker 1>possibly go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

74
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car in front of them slows down,</v>

75
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.143
<v Speaker 1>they slam into it is an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>international news or they don't get as </v>

76
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>all Florida stories are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you believe it?</v>

78
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.584
<v Speaker 1>This woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is she shaving her bikini area while </v>

79
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>driving to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>the woman was from Indiana.</v>

81
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was shaving her hoosier.</v>

82
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

83
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.100
<v Speaker 1>which is I think with that term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

84
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Florida gets the blame for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually,</v>

85
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

86
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it's somebody who came to Florida and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so often the case.</v>

87
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:58.084
<v Speaker 1>If somebody decides he wants to pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself into a stuffed animal in </v>

88
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.254
<v Speaker 1>Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person's going to come wherever he </v>

89
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:04.624
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go to Florida to commit </v>

90
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>that act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

91
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.803
<v Speaker 1>this is why we have so many people doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so many weird things naked with </v>

92
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>love reptiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of reptiles also.</v>

93
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.703
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
