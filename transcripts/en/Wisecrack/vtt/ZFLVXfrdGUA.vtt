<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared here.</v>

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.713
<v Speaker 1>One of the most Cathartic things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>art for me is that it can give voice to </v>

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>our frustrations with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while mocking,</v>

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:16.134
<v Speaker 1>this system is as old as art itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century of version of this </v>

7
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:20.134
<v Speaker 1>story became popular in which characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only criticize the system but </v>

8
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>actively escape it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can cut it down,</v>

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>but recently something a bit different </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become popular,</v>

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.383
<v Speaker 1>like hero rises up to defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a degrading and exploitative system who </v>

11
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>we know is fake bikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in no time at all,</v>

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.693
<v Speaker 1>something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system manages to win in Black </v>

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.223
<v Speaker 1>Mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least our heroes rebellion against a </v>

14
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.084
<v Speaker 1>system of compulsory exercise that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only redeemable for worthless forms of </v>

15
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>entertainment and digital swag gets sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a worthless form of entertainment and</v>

16
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.384
<v Speaker 1>digital swag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the perfect metaphor for the </v>

17
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.114
<v Speaker 1>world we live in?</v>

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.013
<v Speaker 1>Where anticapitalists insurrection one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day get sold in mass by a large </v>

19
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.454
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next or how are we all just become </v>

20
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.064
<v Speaker 1>nihilists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Join me live from the system itself as </v>

21
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>we dive into classics like network or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Matrix,</v>

22
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>fight club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry to Bob,</v>

23
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>you and a few others to ask the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

24
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>is resistance even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

25
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>also rick and Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because who can resist and yeah,</v>

26
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>heavy spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>

27
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>how did we get here in the US during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 thirties factories dominated economic</v>

28
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.564
<v Speaker 1>life and while those were the days where</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people could raise a family by </v>

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>tightening rivets or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists like Charlie Chaplin,</v>

30
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>we're showing the bleaker side of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his film,</v>

31
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.134
<v Speaker 1>modern times chaplain expressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxieties about losing oneself to </v>

32
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:40.584
<v Speaker 1>factory life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaplains spends the film struggling to </v>

33
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>stand out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>express himself,</v>

34
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.054
<v Speaker 1>or make anything meaningful of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film really captures one central </v>

35
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>complaint about fordist capitalism.</v>

36
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Work was repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>

37
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.753
<v Speaker 1>and empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spend time on some assembly line or </v>

38
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>doing paperwork for your boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was no individuality,</v>

39
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or authenticity involved at all.</v>

40
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.113
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he resists the monotony of his life by </v>

41
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>walking off into the sunset to find his </v>
<v Speaker 1>brighter,</v>

42
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
<v Speaker 1>more authentic future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fixation on the dehumanization of </v>

43
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.444
<v Speaker 1>factory work and the escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the something authentic evolved as our </v>

44
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>economy did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't repetitive factory work,</v>

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.833
<v Speaker 1>it was repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointless office work like in fight </v>

46
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.074
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrator rails against the </v>

47
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>emasculating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alienating nature of consumerism.</v>

48
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.053
<v Speaker 1>This is your life and it's ending one </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum of time before Rowdy Tyler </v>

49
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:31.284
<v Speaker 1>durden sets up a gladiator pit for men </v>
<v Speaker 1>to express their authentic masculinity </v>

50
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.423
<v Speaker 1>and occasionally engage in domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism or office space which bemoans </v>

51
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:39.954
<v Speaker 1>the drudgery of office work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tps reports and that God be printer or </v>

52
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell is going on in Brazil.</v>

53
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>In the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new spirit of capitalism,</v>

54
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.163
<v Speaker 1>Lucasville tanned skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each sapelo call this modern time slash </v>

55
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>fight clubs slash office space style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of capitalism.</v>

56
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.033
<v Speaker 1>The artistic critique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It focuses on the loss of autonomy and </v>

57
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>creativity as opposed to critiques that </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on things like poverty or wages.</v>

58
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.193
<v Speaker 1>But what if all this complaining is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the system they rail against all </v>

59
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
<v Speaker 1>the more resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our protagonists from black mirror </v>

60
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>or our second favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick,</v>

61
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>and what if this isn't just something </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to fiction,</v>

62
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>but the very real workplace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:19.894
<v Speaker 1>we can answer that question with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's more interesting than </v>

64
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

65
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.513
<v Speaker 1>Management theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boltanski Sapelo observed a specific </v>

66
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>shift in management literature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and Seventies.</v>

67
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>They were all complaining about workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad attitudes and lack of motivation.</v>

68
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.923
<v Speaker 1>What they found is that your modern time</v>
<v Speaker 1>style artistic critique was actually </v>

69
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.364
<v Speaker 1>affecting economic output workers </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unstimulated by the lack of </v>

70
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>autonomy or creativity or slacking off </v>
<v Speaker 1>or worse,</v>

71
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>not even bothering to show up.</v>

72
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>

73
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.164
<v Speaker 1>at least all the talented college grads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer interested in goal </v>

74
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:53.914
<v Speaker 1>middle management positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boltanski Sapelo named their book after </v>

75
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>one by sociologist Max Faber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faber asks,</v>

76
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>how do you get people to buy into a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic system?</v>

77
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your religion thinks that you need to</v>

78
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>work hard until you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you'll go to hell.</v>

79
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Then it's a pretty great partner for </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging capitalism,</v>

80
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>especially if you got to do this all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

81
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.603
<v Speaker 1>The spirit of capitalism is what engages</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with capitalism in the sixties </v>

82
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That old spirit was failing.</v>

83
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.253
<v Speaker 1>People wanted less fire and brimstone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even good union jobs and more free love </v>

84
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:28.354
<v Speaker 1>and drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Boltanski and Sapelo ask what's the </v>

85
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>new spirit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new spirit of our modern era engages</v>

86
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>people on the grounds of things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomy,</v>

87
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and freedom,</v>

88
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's still the same system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people are still biking all day,</v>

89
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.504
<v Speaker 1>living meaningless lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least they have been show to </v>

90
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:51.211
<v Speaker 1>express their frustration for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>

91
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>you still have to work 12 hour shifts at</v>
<v Speaker 1>subway,</v>

92
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but at least you're now considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich artist,</v>

93
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.003
<v Speaker 1>but going beyond this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can we make of resistance in the </v>

94
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.094
<v Speaker 1>new spirit of capitalism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we culturally need a critique of the </v>

95
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>artistic critique?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to one of my favorites network.</v>

96
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like 15 million merits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie after learning,</v>

97
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>he's about to be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>News anchor,</v>

98
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Howard beale announces his on air </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

99
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to blow my brains out right on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this program a week from today,</v>

100
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.623
<v Speaker 1>which he cynically remarked will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>his dwindling ratings go through the </v>

101
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>roof,</v>

102
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.790
<v Speaker 2>going to get a hell of a writing out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

103
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Then in a pseudo apology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

104
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>he just ran out of bolts and rants about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrid state of the world.</v>

105
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad as hell.</v>

106
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His public meltdowns become so popular.</v>

107
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.523
<v Speaker 1>He's reinstated bringing unprecedented </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratings and therefore money to an </v>

108
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:48.754
<v Speaker 1>otherwise small network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The network also creates the mouse a </v>

109
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:52.054
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our were a bonafide member of the </v>

110
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party preaches revolution.</v>

111
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm lorraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bad ass Cami</v>

112
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.300
<v Speaker 1>culminating in one of my favorite lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>in cinema.</v>

113
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's not going to see a Nigga</v>

114
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.840
<v Speaker 2>goddamn show until we go and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication.</v>

115
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>The producers of network rightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive that the capitalist model is no</v>

116
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>longer about conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow modern times,</v>

117
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>but about rebellion and disillusionment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that sell.</v>

118
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.290
<v Speaker 2>They turned off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot up,</v>

119
00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:19.180
<v Speaker 2>and they themselves limp and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps.</v>

120
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.900
<v Speaker 2>The American people want somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate their rage for them.</v>

121
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Verbal Tansky and Chappelle existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellion,</v>

122
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Marxist critique and revolutionary ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>have basically become the official style</v>

123
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:31.634
<v Speaker 1>of contemporary capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you thought I meant that </v>

124
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>figuratively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps nothing encapsulates this better</v>

125
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:37.844
<v Speaker 1>than the rick and morty episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rick Way to mix up for a bunch of </v>

126
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>bricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toil away in a dehumanizing factory only</v>

127
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>for an act of rebellion to be repackaged</v>
<v Speaker 1>into wafers.</v>

128
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>They give you the taste of the unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor of shattering the grand illusion.</v>

129
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>We might consider media like network 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million merits and simple.</v>

130
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Rick's as the critique of the artistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique.</v>

131
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Why bother railing against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienating nature of the system and it's</v>

132
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>just gonna help someone else's bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

133
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.483
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not just cooptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some media imagines a world where the </v>

134
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>alternative to the system is just as bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the system itself.</v>

135
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 1>In Fight Club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

136
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>men who complained about the degradation</v>
<v Speaker 1>they face in their daily lives.</v>

137
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.683
<v Speaker 1>My two grown kids wouldn't even return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My phone calls eventually go on to join </v>

138
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 1>an organization where they have no names</v>
<v Speaker 1>in project may have.</v>

139
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.073
<v Speaker 1>We have no names are called maggots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maggots and routinely run the risk of </v>

140
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>getting their balls cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are going to take your boss.</v>

141
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.513
<v Speaker 1>Why did the men in fight club go from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in masculine and under capitalism </v>

142
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>to being literally emasculated by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>new dictator?</v>

143
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.490
<v Speaker 1>If anyone ever interferes with project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may even you got to get us balls because</v>

144
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes even our ideas for resistance </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from the system itself.</v>

145
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.593
<v Speaker 1>Other times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resistance is literally created by </v>

146
00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.504
<v Speaker 1>the system to ensure its survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider everyone's favorite trench </v>

147
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus neo the first matrix makes it seem</v>

148
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:06.794
<v Speaker 1>like neo is a classical savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come to liberate the humans from their </v>

149
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>enslavement to the machines and awakened</v>
<v Speaker 1>them from their illusions,</v>

150
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>but we eventually learn in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most pedantic monologues of all time.</v>

151
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.403
<v Speaker 1>That neo is just a product of the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>system he wants to undo morpheus desire </v>

152
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:23.984
<v Speaker 1>on even the prophecy are just part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the system tries to tame the </v>

153
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>human capacity for free will and use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>against them</v>

154
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and we have become exceedingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>

155
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.170
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

156
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.260
<v Speaker 1>freewill doesn't help folks find ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the system.</v>

157
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>The system accounts for freewill and </v>
<v Speaker 1>channels that to the machines benefit,</v>

158
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 1>so pretty bleak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.663
<v Speaker 1>We can't escape the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some resistance actually comes right </v>

160
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:53.101
<v Speaker 1>from the system and the Matrix sequels </v>
<v Speaker 1>still shutting.</v>

161
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.853
<v Speaker 1>We be crying in a corner and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming more media about </v>

162
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.214
<v Speaker 1>disillusionment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we fetishize durden's face on t </v>

163
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 1>shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't we missed the point entirely?</v>

164
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Things you'll end up owning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

165
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>there are some movies that move to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address this problem in snowpiercer.</v>

166
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.874
<v Speaker 1>Survivors of Earth's new ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live on a train organized along class </v>

167
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest in the front,</v>

168
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 1>the poorest in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor stager,</v>

169
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.153
<v Speaker 1>rebellion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reach the front only to discover </v>

170
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>that the revolt was orchestrated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trains leader to thin the population and</v>

171
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>ensure sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>

172
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it seems not unlike our previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>

173
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.823
<v Speaker 1>but the rebels decide that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather crash the train and start all </v>

174
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

175
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Ben Settle for these simple taste of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattering the grand illusion.</v>

176
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.123
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean that the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape the system is to burn the world </v>

177
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily in the recent comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to bother you.</v>

179
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>We see a third option in this film star </v>
<v Speaker 1>Telemarketer,</v>

180
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:52.734
<v Speaker 1>Cassius Green inhabits a darkly familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>world where not even leaked footage of </v>

181
00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 1>human slash horse hybrid slaves can </v>
<v Speaker 1>prompt revolution,</v>

182
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.953
<v Speaker 1>but instead earns a fist bump from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market and praise from scientists </v>

183
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:05.154
<v Speaker 1>and investors get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism is literally dehumanizing </v>

184
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>folks by turning them into equine </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

185
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>and that's still not enough for a wakeup</v>
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

186
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 1>In some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this holds a mirror to us.</v>

187
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>We respond any better when we hear about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon workers pissing and bottles.</v>

188
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.753
<v Speaker 1>Not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film ends with a successful union </v>

189
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>strike that makes our protagonist life </v>
<v Speaker 1>markedly better.</v>

190
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Even though the film is a very skeptical</v>
<v Speaker 1>about escaping the system entirely,</v>

191
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.623
<v Speaker 1>it seems to place a lot of hope in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow struggle to incrementally improve </v>

192
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

193
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we crash the train?</v>

194
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.173
<v Speaker 1>Is there room for slow change or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple rig wafers tastes too good to </v>

195
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 1>risk it worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for prime examples of not being able</v>

196
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:47.574
<v Speaker 1>to escape the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider this whether you want to break </v>
