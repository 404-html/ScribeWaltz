00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here and today we're talking about</v>

3
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>these surprising headscratcher have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>season finale for South Park season 22,</v>

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.853
<v Speaker 1>the final two episodes unfulfilled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bike parade or the first and probably </v>

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>only time you'll see the show quoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the communist manifesto,</v>

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.233
<v Speaker 1>and from their very essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oppressed worker will eventually </v>

7
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>strike back at those capitalists who </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled the means of production.</v>

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.423
<v Speaker 1>We have nothing to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our chains so have matt stone and </v>

9
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Trey Parker turned against big business </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Denisons of South Park.</v>

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out in this wisecrack </v>

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>addition on the finale of South Park </v>
<v Speaker 1>season 22 and obviously spoilers ahead,</v>

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.643
<v Speaker 1>but before we get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to give a quick shout out to our </v>

13
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>sponsors over at wix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wix is the easiest way to create awesome</v>

14
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>professional websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned in an earlier video,</v>

15
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make some side money doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>voiceover work.</v>

16
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So let me show you how I created my </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional site with voice samples.</v>

17
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>So here when to create a website for </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and you can see they have a whole</v>

18
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>bunch of options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a business now,</v>

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.123
<v Speaker 1>designer photography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to build a portfolio and CV </v>

20
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much suck at computers.</v>

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It turns out there's already a template </v>
<v Speaker 1>for voiceover artists.</v>

22
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I picked a style and within minutes I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dragging and dropping my audio files</v>

23
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:21.550
<v Speaker 1>and Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

24
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a site I can send to </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential clients and it looks good.</v>

25
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>So if you're looking to up your game </v>
<v Speaker 1>before 2019,</v>

26
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.803
<v Speaker 1>go to wix.com/wise</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack or click the link in the </v>

27
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:36.001
<v Speaker 1>description to start making your free </v>
<v Speaker 1>website today and now back to the show.</v>

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

29
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap in unfulfilled and Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment center comes to town where a</v>

30
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:43.144
<v Speaker 1>workplace accident crushes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Josh and surviving organs </v>

31
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>are crammed in a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The box opens.</v>

32
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:50.974
<v Speaker 1>I spill out and guide his box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's agitate for working class </v>

33
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:54.334
<v Speaker 1>rebellion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing Amazon's employees to go on </v>

34
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

35
00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>the kids want to flex at the bike parade</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get girls,</v>

36
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but can't deck out their bikes without </v>
<v Speaker 1>their Amazon packages.</v>

37
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Then in bike parade mall workers tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to break the strike and anyone willing </v>

38
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>to help Jeff Bezos gets their orders </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled.</v>

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Once Kenny's newfound socialist beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined their plans for the parade.</v>

40
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do the bike.</v>

41
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.853
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

42
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Commodity fetishism the boys try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it canceled.</v>

43
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy struggling.</v>

44
00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:25.414
<v Speaker 1>We'd business gets a boost from everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>jones for their Amazon packages stoned </v>

45
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.713
<v Speaker 1>in content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The citizens of South Park realized </v>

46
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>they'd rather keep their tegrity than </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck [inaudible] to figure out what Matt</v>

47
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 1>and Trey are saying about the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to start with this intro montage</v>

48
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 1>of the Amazon fulfillment center.</v>

49
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 2>You load 16 tons a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older and deeper in debt.</v>

50
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>The song playing 16 tons has a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>covers,</v>

51
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:51.924
<v Speaker 1>but the original was written by Merle </v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis about the life of coal miners in </v>

52
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.214
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The song highlights the troubles of </v>

53
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:58.584
<v Speaker 1>living in company hounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A common practice that faded out in the </v>

54
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>middle of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Company towns were places where a single</v>

55
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>employer dominated economic life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes companies would open a factory</v>

56
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>and literally build the housing schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hospitals for its employees,</v>

57
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies would pay their employees with</v>

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.044
<v Speaker 1>their own version of vbox bucks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were only redeemable at company owned </v>

59
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:20.704
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What resulted was functionally slavery </v>

60
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.424
<v Speaker 1>with extra steps workers could never </v>
<v Speaker 1>move because all their savings were </v>

61
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>useless outside of the company store dot</v>

62
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.690
<v Speaker 3>or don't check out on MCOs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go</v>

63
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.483
<v Speaker 1>to the company stone and running up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt at the company store would further </v>

64
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>obligate you to stay until you paid it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

65
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>So it South Park Calling Amazon a modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>day company town.</v>

66
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Sure Amazon isn't paying people in prime</v>
<v Speaker 1>box and there's no debt slavery either,</v>

67
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 1>but Amazon does seem to infiltrate every</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of south park life.</v>

68
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Once you got on tap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>

69
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Amazon light and Amazon Ipa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially in episode 10,</v>

70
00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:00.804
<v Speaker 1>we see that the primary motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>working at Amazon is to buy your kids </v>

71
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>more stuff from Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Stacia's motivation for going back to</v>

72
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>work is to have his orders fulfilled for</v>
<v Speaker 1>butters,</v>

73
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:12.990
<v Speaker 1>peacock bike and like the Merle Travis </v>
<v Speaker 1>Song,</v>

74
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>your paycheck has a way of ending up </v>
<v Speaker 1>right back into the company store,</v>

75
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 3>loading up forklift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting paper cuts from boxes,</v>

76
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.693
<v Speaker 3>and for what a measly paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just barely covers our online </v>

77
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 3>purchases</v>

78
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.223
<v Speaker 1>and while the people of south part in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory could take their real dollars to </v>

79
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:29.674
<v Speaker 1>some other businesses to show hints at </v>
<v Speaker 1>how big business coming to town can </v>

80
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>create eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so free market.</v>

81
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>When the boys try to find supplies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest the bike parade,</v>

82
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>all the other businesses have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>

83
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>When the Amazon fulfillment center open </v>
<v Speaker 1>to everything else went out of business.</v>

84
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>A similar dynamic happens not just with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>

85
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>but Walmart were low paid employees only</v>
<v Speaker 1>had enough money to shop at Walmart.</v>

86
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>You get a discount working here 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

87
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.933
<v Speaker 1>That means the baguettes or even better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuring the destruction of local </v>

88
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>businesses driving more people to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Walmart and.</v>

89
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>

90
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>This problem seems encapsulated by Jeff </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bezos is term consumer worker</v>

91
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between classes,</v>

92
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 3>customers and workers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At us,</v>

93
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 3>all I've done is create the new class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consumer worker</v>

94
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>doubling down on the same sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resignation that pervades the season.</v>

95
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.053
<v Speaker 1>People support a company they don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because they feel they don't have </v>

96
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:22.804
<v Speaker 1>any choice.</v>

97
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I want to quit working for Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to join my friends and striking,</v>

98
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but I know that you have to have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff to be happy.</v>

99
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.163
<v Speaker 1>This hopelessness is also a nod to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real life bidding war to host Amazon </v>

100
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>second headquarters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>

101
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Matt stone and Trey Parker are </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarians,</v>

102
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:40.264
<v Speaker 1>and the last two episodes seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>further a criticism of government </v>

103
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:43.624
<v Speaker 1>involvement in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically the way business minded </v>

104
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:46.654
<v Speaker 1>politicians get in bed with giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations to create a grotesque </v>

105
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>version of the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the workers are selling their soul to</v>

106
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:53.464
<v Speaker 1>the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>store towns and governments are selling </v>

107
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>their soul to Jeff Bezos is throbbing.</v>

108
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.353
<v Speaker 4>We had a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You told me this town would be the </v>

109
00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:02.680
<v Speaker 4>perfect place for one of our fulfillment</v>
<v Speaker 4>centers.</v>

110
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.613
<v Speaker 1>The creation of jobs holds local </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments functionally hostage to </v>

111
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:07.094
<v Speaker 1>their whims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you should no longer be a prime </v>

112
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while,</v>

113
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.464
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon fulfillment centers are a good </v>

114
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could easily replace Amazon with any</v>

115
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>sports stadium or manufacturer seeking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tax breaks that forced local governments</v>

116
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>into a race to the bottom and deals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave them another day,</v>

117
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>older and deeper in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

118
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.073
<v Speaker 1>the show criticizes the imbalance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power between companies like Amazon and </v>

119
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:31.034
<v Speaker 1>local communities and their workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon dehumanizes the strikers when </v>

120
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>their status is downgraded from rhyme to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.</v>

121
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>USD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A choice as in me and Josh does humanity</v>

122
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>is exactly what gets him killed when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon labels is death.</v>

123
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.073
<v Speaker 1>Human error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there any escape from this </v>

124
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>nightmare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of as randy bemoans the strike </v>
<v Speaker 1>messing up his business,</v>

126
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>customers start lining up at his door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

127
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>are you selling weed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

128
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:58.904
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife is going nuts not getting her </v>

129
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:01.124
<v Speaker 1>packages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her I find her some Kush local </v>

130
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.284
<v Speaker 1>competition soon forces randy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimize convenience by delivering weed </v>

131
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>to people's homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting an APP.</v>

132
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>We haven't happened out and even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>membership program,</v>

133
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 5>we're just making sure folks are aware.</v>

134
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes the Amazon over week.</v>

135
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>So what is South Park trying to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

136
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

137
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.003
<v Speaker 1>that integrity in business usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean going all the way back to </v>

138
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:26.624
<v Speaker 1>the gnomes episode of season two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that small business can be just </v>

139
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 1>as evil and exploitative as big bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror books.</v>

140
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>We're just using those boys for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

141
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.163
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kids are great to get people on our </v>

142
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>side and 20 years later South Park's </v>
<v Speaker 1>message hasn't deviated much.</v>

143
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 5>You know what they got?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got these days.</v>

144
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You mean the things that almost killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>us on Halloween?</v>

145
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:50.194
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

146
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 5>Why do we use scooters to get directly </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the customers?</v>

147
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.083
<v Speaker 1>Those things that were once devoid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tegrity are now the vehicles with which </v>

148
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:04.770
<v Speaker 1>he sells tegrity wheat and of course the</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode ends with this.</v>

149
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>You come in giant online retailer near </v>
<v Speaker 1>you complain all you want about hotbox,</v>

150
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.373
<v Speaker 1>Walmart or Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to get replaced by </v>

151
00:08:14.881 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 1>something equally sinister because at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day,</v>

152
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:21.840
<v Speaker 1>if I don't get my gamecube adapter for </v>
<v Speaker 1>smash brothers by Wednesday,</v>

153
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm burning this to the ground.</v>

154
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.553
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that the strikers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our Marxist in a box are casting a </v>

155
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.660
<v Speaker 1>pretty sympathetic light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

156
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos has this to say about Josh.</v>

157
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.853
<v Speaker 4>See how the box ridiculous commercialism</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order to try and feel better about </v>

158
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>

159
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.873
<v Speaker 1>a sentiment of resentment echoed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys as they try to cancel the bike </v>

160
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>grade to obscure their own failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to win the bike ride,</v>

161
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but if we get a canceled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everybody loses.</v>

162
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But as what the rest of the season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the message seems to be resignation.</v>

163
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.283
<v Speaker 1>Strikers are encouraged to cross picket </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines to appease their materialistic </v>

164
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:55.760
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others kids on bikes,</v>

165
00:08:55.761 --> 00:08:56.420
<v Speaker 1>and maybe</v>

166
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.940
<v Speaker 4>you won't get off your ass and work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dad</v>

167
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.260
<v Speaker 1>and Josh gets ripped open by a mob of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gift hungry kids.</v>

168
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Josh says,</v>

169
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it makes too many useful things </v>
<v Speaker 1>resulting in too many useless people,</v>

170
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.950
<v Speaker 1>but it seems we can't resist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need your Amazon prime shows in your</v>

171
00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:12.784
<v Speaker 1>music and your books and your things </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered to your door like little </v>

172
00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:15.874
<v Speaker 1>presents to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In true south park fashion are only </v>

173
00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 1>savior is a fake one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fake claim to authenticity in the form</v>

174
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.863
<v Speaker 1>of integrity that ends up just being </v>
<v Speaker 1>repackaged and sold by a huge online </v>

175
00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:28.870
<v Speaker 1>retailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a functional Amazon,</v>

176
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>we're reminded</v>

177
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.040
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to be elite because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>elites gotten old integrity.</v>

178
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Even our anti consumers to send is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular part of the business cycle.</v>

179
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.983
<v Speaker 1>It's not that integrity save south park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cynical interest of randy </v>

180
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.280
<v Speaker 1>packets tegrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got more money now because integrity,</v>

181
00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 1>that's because I figured out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

182
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was once supposed to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter.</v>

183
00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Cultural rejection of modern life </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a symbol for the commodification</v>

184
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.630
<v Speaker 1>of dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bike parade,</v>

185
00:09:56.631 --> 00:09:57.464
<v Speaker 1>which was once a pond and Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scheme to break the strike is now </v>

186
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:01.424
<v Speaker 1>sponsored by tegrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd citywalk and Taco South Park to </v>

187
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>seems content to bask in cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>tegrity.</v>

188
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.560
<v Speaker 1>As the boys tried to cancel the bike </v>
<v Speaker 1>parade,</v>

189
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.453
<v Speaker 1>it becomes clear that the parade is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for the show and its marketing </v>

190
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.170
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag cancer South Park,</v>

191
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.093
<v Speaker 5>we demand you canceled the bike parade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is an added touch with progressive </v>

192
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:20.274
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

193
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Everything out there is getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>canceled,</v>

194
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes to us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just can't do it.</v>

195
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we supposed to just keep going?</v>

196
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Just go on making total assets of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves,</v>

197
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.083
<v Speaker 1>just that south park was promoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself with a half serious critique of </v>

198
00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:37.744
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show is content to continue basking </v>

199
00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:40.474
<v Speaker 1>in the business of selling television </v>
<v Speaker 1>ads where they have serious critique of </v>

200
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.400
<v Speaker 1>consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
