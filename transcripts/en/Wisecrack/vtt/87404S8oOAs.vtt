1
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack jared irl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.353
<v Speaker 1>for those pumping in for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is still an experiment where we </v>

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>quickly respond to developments in TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>and film as they happen,</v>

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>not just rick and Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you like them or have a request,</v>

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.643
<v Speaker 1>let us know the indicators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three return of the world enter was a </v>

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.064
<v Speaker 1>pretty awesome job at marvel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies with the vindicator is acting as </v>

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.964
<v Speaker 1>an obvious stand in for the avengers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick acting as a mouthpiece for people </v>

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:27.864
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned with the rather formulaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of popular cinema or the writers </v>

9
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>have their own press releases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morning,</v>

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of drama queens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend an hour talking at 20 minutes.</v>

11
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Jumping around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll ship blows up there.</v>

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>A phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did one,</v>

13
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it was the big event at at summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it die,</v>

14
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>but instead of focusing on Rick's beef </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our Disney overlords,</v>

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>we're going to set our sights a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher today.</v>

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.363
<v Speaker 1>Superhero films have been clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasping with the concepts of good </v>

17
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:50.874
<v Speaker 1>knievel for what seems like an eternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this episode of Rick and morty </v>

18
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.414
<v Speaker 1>comments on this and some pretty clever </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even profound ways working on this </v>

19
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quick take on vindicator three,</v>

20
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>the return over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guessed it,</v>

21
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>spoilers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>a recap or he gets to choose the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure with Rick,</v>

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>so he decides to spend it with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes.</v>

24
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>The indicators in good Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and fashion rick gets blackout drunk,</v>

25
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.773
<v Speaker 1>destroys the ominous world under with </v>
<v Speaker 1>little effort and traps the indicators </v>

26
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>in a series of trials that ruins them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real art of indicators.</v>

27
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:23.634
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like another morty adventure we know is </v>

28
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>more these optimistic worldview </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbling around him.</v>

29
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.573
<v Speaker 1>In the case of me and destroy mortise </v>
<v Speaker 1>wholesome view of fairytales erodes as </v>

30
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>the genre is subverted.</v>

31
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.863
<v Speaker 1>In this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortise faith in the indicators are </v>

32
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>roads as the superhero genre is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden,</v>

33
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but beneath all the vendors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero jokes.</v>

34
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>So your origin is what you fell into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vat of redundancy.</v>

35
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>This episode is also about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexities of good and evil.</v>

36
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I'd like some adventures where mortise </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the world is shattered.</v>

37
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Rick plays a unique role in making his </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>

38
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You disintegrate here after killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>world under while blackout drunk,</v>

39
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.083
<v Speaker 1>rick creates a saw inspired puzzle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is less a thought out plan to make </v>

40
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.794
<v Speaker 1>people confront their demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all La Jigsaw and more a drunk and </v>

41
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>scheme to push people over a moral cliff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it works.</v>

42
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Vance shows his true colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the learning disabled kid.</v>

43
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>New Photo APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne.</v>

44
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is triggering me.</v>

45
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I need space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need space from a million ants,</v>

46
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>kills Alan rails over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman and crocky bought.</v>

47
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Brings out the indicators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little secret.</v>

48
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>What happened on Dorian five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

49
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We exterminated up planted by the end.</v>

50
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Rick gets to Lord over morty about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sham.</v>

51
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>That is heroism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

52
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.744
<v Speaker 1>Marty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you were sucking the Koolaid out </v>

53
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:44.484
<v Speaker 1>of the indicators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the fact that I was right about that </v>

54
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>must be pretty hard to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

55
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:48.474
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really clever about this episode </v>

56
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>is how they draw from some of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique villains and popular cinema.</v>

57
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Brick is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a saw thing?</v>

58
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Are you seriously sodding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndicators 40.</v>

59
00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm a drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a hack.</v>

60
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.753
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most antagonistic jigsaw isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>about senseless murder or financial </v>

61
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to change people's paradigms by</v>

62
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>making them endorse suffering in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases to make them appreciate life more.</v>

63
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.433
<v Speaker 1>Similarly drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick's trials aren't meant primarily to </v>

64
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.603
<v Speaker 1>eradicate the indicators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather to create a moral crisis for </v>

65
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:20.940
<v Speaker 1>them approving to morty that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not heroes.</v>

66
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Every one in the universe is a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom,</v>

67
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.973
<v Speaker 1>which is why we don't need jackets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure we don't need </v>

68
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>vindicator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

69
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was pretty cool in </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

70
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but what I thought really elevated this </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode was a less obvious inspiration.</v>

71
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>The joker mortise trip in the carnival </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride seems inspired by Alan Moore's,</v>

72
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.124
<v Speaker 1>the killing joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Commissioner Gordon is tortured by </v>

73
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:41.614
<v Speaker 1>the joker like Jigsaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joker isn't only motivated by </v>

74
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.124
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out to prove that with one </v>

75
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:51.271
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently bad day or could become </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as mad as him as another joker.</v>

76
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Inspired by the killing joke puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Madness,</v>

77
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like gravity.</v>

78
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>All it takes is a little push and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Rick's shenanigans in this episode,</v>

79
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>but to push the vindicator to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

80
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:13.161
<v Speaker 1>as the joker infects the once idealistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>harvey with his nihilistic philosophy by</v>

81
00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>killing Rachel and turning corrupt cops </v>
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>

82
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>So too does rick turn the benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicators into violent backstabbers?</v>

83
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Thus appending morty simplistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of good and evil.</v>

84
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

85
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>You managed to destroyed just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything today.</v>

86
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 1>The villains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes,</v>

87
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 1>the lines between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My childhood.</v>

88
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

89
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.370
<v Speaker 1>so rick doesn't really buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroes are good,</v>

90
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>but there's a larger point about how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way were spoonfed narratives of good and</v>

91
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>evil is actually super bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>narratives like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the universe is a hero.</v>

93
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and bad and root</v>

94
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.554
<v Speaker 1>for good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thinking in such simple terms can </v>

95
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 1>lead to problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For philosopher Jacques Ron Sierra,</v>

96
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>the problem with evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a big capital eat,</v>

97
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.853
<v Speaker 1>you know the kind in every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero movie is there any kind of </v>

98
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:05.280
<v Speaker 1>conflict becomes the ultimate struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of good and evil.</v>

99
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>The value of winning that battle becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

101
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a fight for the soul of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>or galaxy or universe,</v>

102
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.433
<v Speaker 1>all or nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people can do even be worse in the </v>

103
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:19.260
<v Speaker 1>world to achieve victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the logic goes,</v>

104
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.213
<v Speaker 1>isn't a justified what's so bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting a few thousand people die if it </v>

105
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 1>means destroying ultimate evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened on Dorian five?</v>

107
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

108
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 1>We exterminated a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

109
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do Nama?</v>

110
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Tron was hiding there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a shape shifter.</v>

111
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Destroying Dorian five was the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill him.</v>

112
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I could have made you a device to </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect.</v>

113
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.493
<v Speaker 1>Do Nama metronic from orbit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this say about the </v>

114
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.133
<v Speaker 1>syndicators?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To summarize the problem with infinite </v>

115
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.513
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether in the form of world destroyers </v>

116
00:05:51.231 --> 00:05:54.560
<v Speaker 1>or mortal humans is they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite justice.</v>

117
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.513
<v Speaker 1>The kind that doesn't really care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>morals or people of Dorian five and </v>

118
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:02.580
<v Speaker 1>often even loses sight of the justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>part by the end of the episode,</v>

119
00:06:02.581 --> 00:06:03.414
<v Speaker 1>Supernova has also been infected with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick's nihilistic philosophy no longer </v>

120
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 1>believing in a real division between </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

121
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.543
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she recognizes the simplistic division </v>

122
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>must be upheld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you said,</v>

123
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never said that.</v>

124
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>The galaxies faith in the vindicator </v>
<v Speaker 1>that keeps the galaxy secure.</v>

125
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>She's willing to kill Rick and Morty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even her lover to protect the perception</v>

126
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>that the indicators are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not their actions that matter.</v>

127
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>It's the galaxies faith in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

128
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>That does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

129
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>This is another shout out to the dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>knight,</v>

130
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.363
<v Speaker 1>which is probably the best example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral grayness in a comic book movie </v>

131
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.203
<v Speaker 1>where Batman lies about the goodness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Dent to maintain peace in order </v>

132
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>in Gotham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supernova wants the galaxy to believe in</v>

133
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>a similar lie about herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In both cases,</v>

134
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.564
<v Speaker 1>people are advocating for a noble lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that societies can be built on </v>

135
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.914
<v Speaker 1>a myth that maintains order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An idea made famous by the Greek </v>

136
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:58.424
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Plato and it's not the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time rick and morty has made this kind </v>

137
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 1>of dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knight asked Noble Lie,</v>

138
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.910
<v Speaker 1>shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found it inside a lockbox box.</v>

139
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Inside King Jellybeans closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to tell the people,</v>

140
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy it,</v>

141
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 1>or people will get more from the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He represented from the Jelly Bean,</v>

142
00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:26.190
<v Speaker 1>he actually was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

143
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:27.024
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of philosophy 101,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth noting at least because </v>

144
00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:30.444
<v Speaker 1>of its relation to the dark knight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where the dark knight kind of </v>

145
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:33.144
<v Speaker 1>celebrates the slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick and morty uses it to deconstruct </v>

146
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:36.774
<v Speaker 1>the myths of superheroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick says good and bad are artificial </v>

147
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.260
<v Speaker 1>constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:41.094
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the feeling he kind of needs that </v>

149
00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:44.610
<v Speaker 1>to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

150
00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:48.240
<v Speaker 1>rather than just deconstructing good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil as arbitrary concepts,</v>

151
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.150
<v Speaker 1>which by the way it's done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean seriously,</v>

152
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I may be the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your grandpa is the devil.</v>

153
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Show was also suggesting that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete absence of these concepts isn't</v>

154
00:07:58.021 --> 00:07:58.854
<v Speaker 1>so great either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a clever call back to the last </v>

155
00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:03.780
<v Speaker 1>episode where Dr Wong Confronts Rick in </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

156
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.703
<v Speaker 1>only connection between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>unquestionable intelligence and the </v>

157
00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:10.170
<v Speaker 1>sickness destroying your family is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in your family,</v>

158
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:13.620
<v Speaker 1>you've included use intelligence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify sickness.</v>

159
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the vindicator fail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>critically engaged with their methods or</v>

160
00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:18.024
<v Speaker 1>even their mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick refuses to engage with his </v>

161
00:08:19.861 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 1>decisions for the exact opposite reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nothing matters,</v>

162
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.120
<v Speaker 1>and if nothing matters and good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just social constructs,</v>

163
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.013
<v Speaker 1>then he can't consider his actions evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just continue doing whatever he </v>

164
00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:32.364
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the episode presents us with to </v>

165
00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:36.570
<v Speaker 1>differing perspectives regarding good </v>
<v Speaker 1>knievel,</v>

166
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.780
<v Speaker 1>both of which are in typical rick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>morty fashion,</v>

167
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.763
<v Speaker 1>completely dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We either have zero conviction of the </v>

168
00:08:43.681 --> 00:08:44.514
<v Speaker 1>division between good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads rick to doing whatever he </v>

169
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 1>wants and it not mattering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we have complete and utter conviction</v>

170
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes good and evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people end up doing really messed up for</v>

171
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>the sake of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like blow up an entire planet.</v>

172
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Rick and Morty,</v>

173
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>there are no right answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only wrong ones.</v>

174
