<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.803
<v Speaker 1>Helen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask anyone to explain why they </v>

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:18.714
<v Speaker 1>love Nathan for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably say some iteration of </v>

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have to watch it.</v>

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Nathan fielder paints a bizarre picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>of America,</v>

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.843
<v Speaker 1>colored by strange individuals ranging </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the verbally abusive private </v>

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.324
<v Speaker 1>investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remind me of the wizard of </v>

11
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.094
<v Speaker 1>loneliness to the ex con Santa Claus to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Stalker Esque Bill Gates </v>

12
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>impersonator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one level,</v>

13
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Nathan's impossibly complex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical plans belie analysis,</v>

14
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>but as you already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna.</v>

15
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Stop us because Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the insanity,</v>

16
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.543
<v Speaker 1>the show crackles with brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary holding up a mirror to the </v>

17
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.173
<v Speaker 1>absurdity of running a modern business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack addition on </v>

18
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Nathan for you and sort of maybe kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

19
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Here's the premise of the show and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical episode of Nathan for you host.</v>

20
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.414
<v Speaker 1>Nathan fielder introduces us to one or </v>
<v Speaker 1>more struggling business owners and </v>

21
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>proposals that cockamamie plan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their luck.</v>

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.733
<v Speaker 1>You'll let minors purchase alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then held it in a storage locker </v>

23
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.434
<v Speaker 1>until their 21st birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plaza liquor would gain a ton of new </v>

24
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 1>underwriter customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we watch the plan escalate,</v>

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Speaker 1>deviate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost inevitably fail</v>

26
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 2>for this mash up of retail and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Try and wreck on the most basic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the plots,</v>

28
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:33.474
<v Speaker 1>Nathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can reveal something about the strained </v>

29
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>relationship between morality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic realities.</v>

30
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.713
<v Speaker 1>To seriously are they talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a banner that says we sell </v>

31
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>liquor to minors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan has described the way the series </v>

32
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:46.284
<v Speaker 1>was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partially out of his own obsession with </v>

33
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the 2008 economic collapse in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>risky bank behavior took down the global</v>

34
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.574
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What really fascinated him was the way </v>

35
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.454
<v Speaker 1>this cataclysmic fiscal rap was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of thousands and thousands of </v>

36
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.743
<v Speaker 1>seemingly mundane moments like when one </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy must have known his boss's credit </v>

37
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:09.321
<v Speaker 1>default swap magic was a bunch of woo in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly every episode of Nathan for you.</v>

38
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.823
<v Speaker 1>He makes us live through these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sickening moments after he pitched and </v>

39
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>absurd sometimes immoral idea to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business owner.</v>

40
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>The plan turned the job of moving into </v>
<v Speaker 1>America's next fitness craze.</v>

41
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Watch each person reluctantly agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that will likely mislead.</v>

42
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Exploit the labor of insult or terrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer.</v>

43
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.163
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll get a lot more people if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just think it's a workout and we </v>

44
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>don't tell them that they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing free labor.</v>

45
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.223
<v Speaker 1>There's the antique store owner who </v>
<v Speaker 1>tepidly extends her business hours to </v>

46
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>lauren drunk customers who are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall prey to the stores.</v>

47
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>You break it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy it policy.</v>

48
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I just wouldn't prefer a broken item.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather sell a good one,</v>

49
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:48.654
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would be the same thing no </v>

50
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:53.020
<v Speaker 1>matter what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So during each of these moments,</v>

51
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.883
<v Speaker 1>the owner's reluctance is palpable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's typically eclipsed by their </v>

52
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>desire to improve their business to </v>
<v Speaker 1>please Nathan.</v>

53
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably people will think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Or simply just say on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>

56
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have this information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if I have the use,</v>

57
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.101
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

58
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.934
<v Speaker 1>She was engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically they'll justify it as a means </v>

59
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>of achieving bottom line profits </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime.</v>

60
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Removing any product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always beneficial to stores in this</v>

61
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.094
<v Speaker 1>subset of Nathan's pranks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching decent human beings cajoled </v>

62
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:24.694
<v Speaker 1>into small acts of immorality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranges from painfully uncomfortable to </v>

63
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>flat out on believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>You know the drill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the last stop.</v>

66
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.133
<v Speaker 1>Take the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan convinces this man that he's </v>

67
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>being hired as a shell pr representative</v>
<v Speaker 1>enticed by the incentive of a good job.</v>

68
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>The man is willing to say things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

69
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 3>This mill right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this building a relatively small.</v>

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 3>If you had to have a spill somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would want this.</v>

71
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Bill Mason</v>

72
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.050
<v Speaker 1>highlights the way a system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasizes personal gains at the expense</v>

73
00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>of community good sets up decent human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings to become their worst selves,</v>

74
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.753
<v Speaker 4>and these are for people that you cut in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of that you thought you were </v>

75
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 4>better than including a nine year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

76
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.743
<v Speaker 1>Part of the strength of Nathan satire </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the fact that each of his </v>

77
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:15.224
<v Speaker 1>ideas have some real world basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes business antics that we're </v>

78
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.483
<v Speaker 1>generally pretty comfortable with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transports them to a place of queasy </v>

79
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including.</v>

80
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the toy company episode,</v>

81
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.300
<v Speaker 1>he takes a familiar kind of advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

82
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.143
<v Speaker 1>targeted towards children owning a doin </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid is now the only proof that you are </v>

83
00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:38.360
<v Speaker 1>not a baby here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and reveals something uncomfortable</v>

84
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.194
<v Speaker 1>about businesses that stealthily exploit</v>
<v Speaker 1>or worst insecurities to get a piece of </v>

85
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.630
<v Speaker 1>our hard earned paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan,</v>

86
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.464
<v Speaker 1>for you showcases the struggle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small business owner trying to compete </v>

87
00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:49.814
<v Speaker 1>in the global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subverting the narrative that anyone </v>

88
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:55.880
<v Speaker 1>willing to work hard can simply pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves up by their own bootstraps.</v>

89
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.833
<v Speaker 1>Nathan puts his own spin on the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream by first giving us the classic </v>

90
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:00.884
<v Speaker 1>protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hardworking cab driver or electronic </v>

91
00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 1>store owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

92
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

93
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

94
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.513
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for small business and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>paints his own presence as the savvy </v>

95
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:14.960
<v Speaker 1>business consultant or the dose of luck </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to revitalize their business,</v>

96
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.933
<v Speaker 4>but maybe there's a shortcut to actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>having brand recognition using a little </v>

97
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 4>something called parody law.</v>

98
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.143
<v Speaker 1>What's the goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't actually to help the businesses </v>

99
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:24.754
<v Speaker 1>find success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to underscore the absurdity super </v>

100
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>officiality and futility of modern day </v>
<v Speaker 1>business in the first place.</v>

101
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.223
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when his scheme to make an </v>

102
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.354
<v Speaker 1>elaborately orchestrated video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pig rescuing the golden a petting </v>

103
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>zoo go viral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually worked.</v>

104
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He perversely left the zoo's name out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>

105
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.330
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want it to come across like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ad for the petting zoo.</v>

106
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.223
<v Speaker 4>I thought it'd be a bit transparent so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if people would have known that it </v>

107
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 4>was old tree village can be so selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This</v>

108
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.030
<v Speaker 1>mistake is a gag that actually gets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of the show's mission.</v>

109
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.363
<v Speaker 1>The short lifespan of any viral animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>video pretty much ensures the fact that </v>

110
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>even if properly advertised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the petting zoo would have quickly faded</v>

111
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>back into cultural oblivion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan just expedited the process.</v>

112
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Even when Nathan's plans do succeed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the short term,</v>

113
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.400
<v Speaker 1>they're typically two implausible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive in the longterm.</v>

114
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.453
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles Health Department shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb starbucks yesterday because it did </v>

115
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.234
<v Speaker 1>not have proper permits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually the business owner ends up </v>

116
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.593
<v Speaker 1>exactly where they started and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the show is highlighting the </v>

117
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:32.141
<v Speaker 1>impossibility of going up against big </v>
<v Speaker 1>business even when your plans are insane</v>

118
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.493
<v Speaker 1>and involve alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is never more clear than when </v>

119
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Nathan attempts to take on a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>brands.</v>

120
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.573
<v Speaker 1>In one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tries to help an electronic store </v>

121
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>owner compete with best buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their sales are ridiculous.</v>

122
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no way that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

123
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.333
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem is best buy's price </v>
<v Speaker 1>match policy in which they promise to </v>

124
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>match any price from neighboring stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing anyone from underselling them</v>

125
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 1>faith and proposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use price match against the company</v>

126
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.493
<v Speaker 1>by offering to sell TVs for $1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would allow them to stock up on </v>

127
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 1>best buy's entire supply as expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bestbuy finds a way out of it.</v>

128
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not a competitor.</v>

129
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.993
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time that Nathan is trying </v>

130
00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>to use best buy system to his advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and the small store owner,</v>

131
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to even more elaborate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd lengths to game their own </v>

132
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>customers,</v>

133
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.563
<v Speaker 4>printing out some flyers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributing them throughout the </v>

134
00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:27.174
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was finally time for Alan to offer </v>

135
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.990
<v Speaker 4>his $1 prices to the world,</v>

136
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 1>obscuring their $1 TV's with a black tie</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress code and alive allocator.</v>

137
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.030
<v Speaker 1>After a failed ball suit and a staged </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality show,</v>

138
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>we ultimately hear the message loud and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

139
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.133
<v Speaker 1>The international corporations can </v>
<v Speaker 1>design rules that plunge small </v>

140
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 1>businesses into financial ruin.</v>

141
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm just so sick and tired of these big </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies like best buy and Ron thinking</v>

142
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 4>that you know the rules don't apply to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

143
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.693
<v Speaker 1>not content to suggest that the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive business climate robs us of </v>

144
00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 1>our morality and doomed to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show also explores the uncomfortable</v>

145
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 1>relationship between modern business </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectives and mortality.</v>

146
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 1>To understand why this matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to examine the ideas of Pulitzer</v>

147
00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>prize winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Theorist Ernest Becker,</v>

148
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 1>who saw the motivations behind our </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to acquire money as simply put,</v>

149
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.700
<v Speaker 1>are futile efforts to escape death as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote in his book,</v>

150
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.593
<v Speaker 1>escape from evil money can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated and passed on and so </v>

151
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.360
<v Speaker 1>radiates its powers even after one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

152
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.493
<v Speaker 1>giving one a semblance of immortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan explores this relationship in </v>

153
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:36.294
<v Speaker 1>several of his episodes taking the logic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of acquisition and the narcissism </v>

154
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:40.434
<v Speaker 1>implicit in it and the plaza to the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>more bit of possible causes of funeral </v>

155
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:46.140
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one episode,</v>

156
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.063
<v Speaker 1>he convinced us a funeral home to offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>a service in which the unpopular dead </v>

157
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.840
<v Speaker 1>can hire actors to attend their funerals</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they appear to be well liked.</v>

158
00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 1>This is the ridiculous albion logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>extension of a consumer's world in which</v>

159
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.200
<v Speaker 1>we amassed objects and instagram likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to feel hip,</v>

160
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>cool and validated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more in other episodes.</v>

161
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Nathan explores the uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of monetizing the death.</v>

162
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He convinces a travel agent who only has</v>
<v Speaker 1>very elderly customers to start offering</v>

163
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:18.804
<v Speaker 1>funeral services to squeeze those </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers for every cent before they </v>

164
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes a very familiar logic,</v>

165
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.943
<v Speaker 1>diversifying your business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes it incredibly eerie by </v>

166
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>literally capitalizing off deaths.</v>

167
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.123
<v Speaker 4>This is a last ditch effort to squeeze </v>
<v Speaker 4>out as much as you can from your </v>

168
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 4>customers before they're gone for good.</v>

169
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.193
<v Speaker 1>By applying a pretty banal business </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept to the most ghoulish of </v>

170
00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan exposes the inherit culturism.</v>

171
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes implicit in trying to upsell </v>
<v Speaker 1>your customers towards the end,</v>

172
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.693
<v Speaker 1>it makes an attempt to save on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overhead costs of cremations by testing </v>

173
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:56.530
<v Speaker 1>out the idea of using a wood fire pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>oven instead of a crematorium.</v>

174
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 4>A few more hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it all just burned to a crisp?</v>

175
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.213
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that work the same for a human </v>

176
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 4>body?</v>

177
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.873
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a really strange </v>

178
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>hopefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insincerity to Nathan for you.</v>

179
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.783
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the very few reality </v>

180
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:11.934
<v Speaker 1>shows in which the people depicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically don't come across as crazy </v>

181
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic jerks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually,</v>

182
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.413
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sympathetic to show will often </v>

183
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:21.264
<v Speaker 1>stall on strange moments of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's somewhat disturbing like </v>

184
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:28.720
<v Speaker 1>the gas station owners propensity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking his grandson's urine.</v>

185
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.583
<v Speaker 4>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm promoting because the ground </v>

186
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 4>grandsons peer sometimes help or these </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually experimental brothers,</v>

187
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 4>so you guys are brothers</v>

188
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.703
<v Speaker 1>and you guys will have sex with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl or the extremely ghost where a </v>

189
00:10:43.001 --> 00:10:47.650
<v Speaker 1>realtor would choked in Switzerland </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier,</v>

190
00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:48.484
<v Speaker 1>we are shocked by was by an entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other times these displays of humanity </v>

191
00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:54.470
<v Speaker 1>are just really genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to be okay.</v>

192
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.553
<v Speaker 1>The show highlights the tension between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those slivers of humanity and the </v>

193
00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:02.050
<v Speaker 1>mandates of our modern economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

194
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.943
<v Speaker 1>in one scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan sets his production assistant </v>

195
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:05.784
<v Speaker 1>Solomon up on a date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but agrees to have it sponsored by </v>

196
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.603
<v Speaker 1>Quiznos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a quiznos rep is brought on standby </v>

197
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>to deliver branded dialogue in real time</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Solomon to say him say toasty.</v>

198
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.373
<v Speaker 1>Toasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very self reflexive critique </v>

199
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.200
<v Speaker 1>of the television industry as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which at the end of the day,</v>

200
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.303
<v Speaker 1>only makes money by padding it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping human dramas and comedies with </v>

201
00:11:30.431 --> 00:11:32.710
<v Speaker 1>commercial breaks every 10 or so </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

202
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.843
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the show asks in a world over </v>

203
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.640
<v Speaker 1>saturated with advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we hope for a true connection?</v>

204
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.793
<v Speaker 1>It shows best through line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explores this question by depicting </v>

205
00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Nathan's ongoing quest to find love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship.</v>

206
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Whether Nathan's forcing auditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>actress to say,</v>

207
00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you again.</v>

208
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.133
<v Speaker 4>I love you</v>

209
00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.360
<v Speaker 1>for asking a shopkeeper if he'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out to be rejected.</v>

210
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.223
<v Speaker 4>Would you ever want to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes socially with me outside of </v>

211
00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:04.820
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

212
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.653
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan's antics are hilarious because </v>

213
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:10.280
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly calibrated to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>people off.</v>

214
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.050
<v Speaker 1>He's the king of inopportunity hugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>misguided attempts at small talk.</v>

215
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.210
<v Speaker 4>If it makes it a little bit safer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

216
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.090
<v Speaker 4>would you be comfortable just being </v>
<v Speaker 4>handcuffed,</v>

217
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.003
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoys letting his genuine </v>

218
00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities take center stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is never more true than when Nathan</v>

219
00:12:26.521 --> 00:12:28.950
<v Speaker 1>treats himself like a struggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>business</v>

220
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.813
<v Speaker 4>and I know that as a TV host,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a personality that people don't </v>

221
00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:33.324
<v Speaker 4>like is bad for business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I needed to make a </v>

222
00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:36.720
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

223
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Scheming to improve is desirability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a friend and lover,</v>

224
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>he paints himself as the hunk on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetup dating show.</v>

225
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.590
<v Speaker 1>He also conducts a focus group to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve his likability.</v>

226
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.513
<v Speaker 1>I think v-neck would go well with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been brilliant and stages and </v>

227
00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:53.400
<v Speaker 1>elaborate scientific experiment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve that.</v>

228
00:12:53.401 --> 00:12:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Hanging out with him is fun.</v>

229
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.790
<v Speaker 4>So if their serotonin or dopamine levels</v>
<v Speaker 4>go up when they're hanging out with me,</v>

230
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.740
<v Speaker 4>that would mean that I'm fun</v>

231
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>in treating human interaction like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

232
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Nathan embodies the loneliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation of our modern world.</v>

233
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.663
<v Speaker 1>At other times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan actually offers an answer with </v>

234
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.960
<v Speaker 1>strange moments of genuine human </v>
<v Speaker 1>connectedness throughout the series,</v>

235
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.740
<v Speaker 1>solidarity forms amongst a troop of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebates seekers who camp out with Nathan</v>

236
00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:19.574
<v Speaker 1>on the mountain,</v>

237
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.583
<v Speaker 4>we agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The friendship that we gained here is </v>

238
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 4>just incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's go down the mountain,</v>

239
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.620
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

240
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.100
<v Speaker 1>an oddly compelling relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>develops between Nathan antibodies,</v>

241
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.550
<v Speaker 1>most lovable sex worker facing happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday.</v>

242
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 1>He's interactions are always mediated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

243
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:36.684
<v Speaker 1>On some level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rebate seekers are waiting for </v>

244
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.384
<v Speaker 1>Nathan to get them their rebates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>macy as being paid handsomely to hang </v>

245
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:44.940
<v Speaker 1>out with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but glimmers of true curiosity,</v>

246
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.833
<v Speaker 1>affection and shared humanity shine </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and it's really beautiful to </v>

247
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adjusted.</v>

248
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:51.024
<v Speaker 1>Human connectedness is the bomb that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the current conditions of the </v>

249
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:55.980
<v Speaker 1>modern world terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

250
00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:56.814
<v Speaker 1>Nathan literalize is this thesis by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending the subjects of this failed </v>

251
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:00.534
<v Speaker 1>schemes up on dates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that there's economic </v>

252
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:07.350
<v Speaker 1>situations could be bearable if only </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had love and conclusion.</v>

253
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Nathan for you is a giant smirk holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sign that says,</v>

254
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:11.903
<v Speaker 1>please love me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It explores all the cynical motivations </v>

255
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:15.354
<v Speaker 1>that govern us in dys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless era of startups and branded </v>

256
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.820
<v Speaker 1>everything and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

257
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe hanging out with the right group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Weirdos could be just the antidote.</v>

258
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Unique.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're gonna want to stay informed about</v>

260
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:36.360
<v Speaker 1>the world of business rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting bogged down by all those dents,</v>

263
