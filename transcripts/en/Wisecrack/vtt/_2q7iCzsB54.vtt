1
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.613
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

2
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated answer.</v>

3
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.923
<v Speaker 2>I think they should definitely be there </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a last resort and probably for </v>

4
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic health insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you know,</v>

5
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.851
<v Speaker 2>there's a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 2>should the government pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare?</v>

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you say yes to that and think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>solved the problem,</v>

8
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>you haven't because the question </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes,</v>

9
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much healthcare should they pay for?</v>

10
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Should they pay for the 80 year old lady</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a vegetable to stay alive?</v>

11
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Another six months?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should they pay for the liver transplant</v>

12
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 2>of the 40 year old alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.323
<v Speaker 2>should they pay for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the operation on the guy who refused to </v>

14
00:00:57.951 --> 00:00:58.784
<v Speaker 2>wear his helmet and the motorcycle up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our resources are finite and we need to </v>

15
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 2>do a much better job of figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we spend them in where we don't.</v>

16
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 2>And right now we make a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions opaquely.</v>

17
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 2>If you're black and poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances are you're not going to get good</v>

18
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 2>healthcare care if you're rich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

19
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.173
<v Speaker 2>Even if you didn't pay your insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances are you know somebody who knows </v>

20
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.034
<v Speaker 2>somebody at Mount Sinai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to get better cancer </v>

21
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:27.434
<v Speaker 2>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in Iowa and there's a certain </v>

22
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 2>operation that might cure you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they offered only in Seattle,</v>

23
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.193
<v Speaker 2>you're probably not going to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>operation and we're never going to have </v>

24
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:40.334
<v Speaker 2>a world of equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should at least have a world of </v>

25
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:49.451
<v Speaker 2>equality of opportunity and we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid ourselves that.</v>

26
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Every life is infinitely more valuable </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything else.</v>

27
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 2>We make trade offs all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>

28
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.363
<v Speaker 2>We don't feed children right in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We we destroy lives much earlier than </v>

29
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:09.671
<v Speaker 2>when they show up in the hospital and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is we don't like to confront</v>

30
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:18.521
<v Speaker 2>these decisions just as you might not </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to confront decisions about that.</v>

31
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier that your personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

32
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 2>we as a society feel uncomfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicit rules.</v>

33
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Yet those things get adjudicated all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

34
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.663
<v Speaker 2>Just quietly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't really answer your </v>

35
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.464
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think at the at the day to day </v>

36
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people should pay their own costs,</v>

37
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real issue is how it had to design a</v>

38
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:45.794
<v Speaker 2>system than incentivize healthy behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>because most of the healthcare costs in </v>

39
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:51.284
<v Speaker 2>this country are due to either end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life or what is essentially the results </v>

40
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 2>of bad behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

41
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lung cancer,</v>

42
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.553
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not assigned that you've been </v>

43
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:04.924
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are aggravated by poor </v>

44
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>nutritional habits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of exercise,</v>

45
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we could just get people to adopt</v>

46
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 2>much healthier lifestyles or medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs will go down,</v>

47
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really want the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring what people eat either.</v>

48
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>So the challenge is how to change social</v>
<v Speaker 2>norms without brainwashing people,</v>

49
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>let them understand their genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

50
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 2>educate them better at school.</v>

51
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that's,</v>

52
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's has a huge role to play in </v>

53
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>this just by what they offer people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>

54
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.443
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the food companies could start </v>

55
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.343
<v Speaker 2>promoting genuinely healthy food rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than kind of what does it truthiness </v>

56
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.303
<v Speaker 2>fruitiness where you put chemicals into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and claim that it's more </v>

57
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.961
<v Speaker 2>healthy because it has some kind of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of nutrition.</v>

58
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:12.361
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like if you put please into</v>
<v Speaker 2>something saying that it's polite,</v>

59
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is still rude,</v>

60
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.403
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely complicated and more </v>

61
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.644
<v Speaker 2>information is a start more information </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the impact of the kind of food we </v>

62
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>just as in the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more information about the impact of the</v>

63
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things we drive or the stuff we</v>
<v Speaker 2>use or the cost of air conditioning,</v>

64
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:41.074
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
