00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Norm minetta and I'm vice chairman of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hill and Knowlton</v>

2
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.923
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure is so important is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly linked to productivity </v>

3
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:25.144
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's been a tremendous amount of </v>

4
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Speaker 1>productivity increase since the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II.</v>

5
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And that increased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped,</v>

6
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:40.501
<v Speaker 1>maybe not stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it slowed down about maybe 10,</v>

7
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>12 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The there was still increasing,</v>

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>but the rate of the increase of </v>
<v Speaker 1>flattened out.</v>

9
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>But in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think five years or so,</v>

10
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.163
<v Speaker 1>85 to eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity has gone down because of </v>

11
00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.224
<v Speaker 1>congestion in urban areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my feeling is that here we are </v>

12
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:09.781
<v Speaker 1>competing in a global economic place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot allow,</v>

13
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.613
<v Speaker 1>and we can't afford to have our </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity going down at a time when </v>

14
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 1>we're competing in the economic a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.</v>

15
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why we need this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infusion of money into infrastructure.</v>

16
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logical source in the past has been,</v>

17
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.383
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gasoline tax or the fuel tax for a </v>

18
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>diesel fuel or excise tax on batteries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tires,</v>

19
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.893
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with the fuel efficiency of </v>

20
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>automobiles going up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>the 18.4</v>
<v Speaker 1>cents,</v>

22
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>federal gasoline tax just produces less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money into the highway trust fund.</v>

23
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's either going to be increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline taxes,</v>

24
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>which for which there's a resistance or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.690
<v Speaker 1>some other form of fuel tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe based on the odometer reading,</v>

26
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

27
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.793
<v Speaker 1>but there's still going to be a gap from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that generates and what the needs </v>

28
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:31.044
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my feeling is that public private </v>

29
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>partnerships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to be used to fill that gap.</v>

30
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I think when you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:52.301
<v Speaker 1>it probably would a surround a what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think of maybe as employment.</v>

33
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>What does it do in terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially right now,</v>

34
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the unemployment rate,</v>

35
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.673
<v Speaker 1>what is it do in terms of employment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do in terms of the </v>

36
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.720
<v Speaker 1>environment and what does it do in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the economy as a whole?</v>

37
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>and I think from there you can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsets of each of those broad areas and</v>

39
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.453
<v Speaker 1>come up with criteria that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable to any project that might be </v>

40
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:30.214
<v Speaker 1>funded so that you're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency and effectiveness of that </v>

41
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then at the end of the day,</v>

42
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not just this question of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

43
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that's nice you spent $200 million on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that project,</v>

44
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but what did we get for that $200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million?</v>

45
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Seems to me that</v>

46
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.180
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>return to more bipartisanship,</v>

47
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.463
<v Speaker 1>that the American people are tired of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of constant bickering going on </v>

48
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:13.890
<v Speaker 1>back and forth between the Congress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the executive branch,</v>

49
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>there ought to be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.270
<v Speaker 1>civility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

52
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>in the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 1>between the administration and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress panned,</v>

54
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the congress as well.</v>

55
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
