1
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Of course it will depend on which cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about.</v>

2
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we will see variations </v>

3
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>between different parts of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the United States.</v>

4
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.173
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my prognosis is that the biggest game </v>

5
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.891
<v Speaker 1>changer in the future of cities by 2050 </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be the technology at the moment,</v>

6
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>which is rapidly erupting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>connectivity.</v>

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:43.584
<v Speaker 1>and often it often occurs to me that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the travel that we do in our </v>

9
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>current environment is not travel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we really want to do.</v>

10
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:57.771
<v Speaker 1>It's because we work somewhere distant </v>
<v Speaker 1>from where we live.</v>

11
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And I would like to think that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities in 2050 generally,</v>

12
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>each area of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large city,</v>

13
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.074
<v Speaker 1>it will become more community based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be a lot more options for </v>

14
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>people not to have to move around in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

15
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.453
<v Speaker 1>So rather than commute 20 or 30 miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>across a big city will have the </v>

16
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to do a lot of our work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not all of it,</v>

17
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of our work quite close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we live,</v>

18
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.583
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to get away from the idea </v>

19
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
<v Speaker 1>that we live in large dormitory areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have all of our work in </v>

20
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>industry and a office space and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

21
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.753
<v Speaker 1>There are plenty of good examples of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can mix a mixed the zones up and </v>

22
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>still make a very livable and enjoyable </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for people to live in.</v>

23
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So rather than a commute being a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hours out of every day,</v>

24
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a commute means just a couple of </v>

25
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.573
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

26
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more difficult to,</v>

27
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.293
<v Speaker 1>that's more difficult to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if the human race is still </v>

28
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>around in a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.263
<v Speaker 1>it means that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been hung very much over the edge </v>

30
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>of the cliff and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have got good at a lot of things.</v>

31
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I think even maybe by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

33
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it a little before,</v>

34
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 1>we will probably be moving goods a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>less and food we will be needing to grow</v>

35
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the food and the goods that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>consume.</v>

36
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.933
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to produce that much more </v>

37
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:40.764
<v Speaker 1>locally to where we live rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorcing it from the cities need to </v>

38
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>become more integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same with work.</v>

39
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be far more community</v>

40
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways it will require us to,</v>

41
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>to go backwards a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it will be living in smaller,</v>

42
00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more desirable living spaces.</v>

43
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will,</v>

44
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

45
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>it's so difficult to predict what </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies will have available.</v>

46
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in 90 years time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult enough in 50 years time,</v>

47
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:16.411
<v Speaker 1>but so it's really difficult to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we've got cities and 2100,</v>

48
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me very optimistic that we'll be </v>

49
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>still around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be,</v>

50
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.303
<v Speaker 1>if we're still around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means we figured out how to do a lot </v>

51
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>of things much better than we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

52
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
