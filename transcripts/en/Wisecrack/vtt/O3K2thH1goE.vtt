00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.983
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack disembodied jared again here </v>

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>to continue our epic philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan trilogy.</v>

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>In our first installment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan begins.</v>

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>We covered his interpretations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self in his early films plus inception.</v>

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.793
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to be a self?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we trust ourselves and our own </v>

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.174
<v Speaker 1>thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're asking if there's so much </v>

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.754
<v Speaker 1>conflict already present in the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the implications for a </v>

8
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>community full of cells if we can't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle our own issues?</v>

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to avoid conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people or is violence inevitable?</v>

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.983
<v Speaker 1>This is the foundational questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding Gotham City in the dark </v>

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>knight trilogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so suit up for some time with the Batman</v>

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.733
<v Speaker 1>and were not wearing hockey pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcomeness wisecrack addition on the </v>

13
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of Christopher Nolan Park </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>and Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's spoilers ahead behind the face.</v>

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.794
<v Speaker 1>Paint and pointy eared masks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotham is experiencing crisis after </v>

16
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>crisis that affect the functioning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its social body.</v>

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>The mob is pumping and drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops are helping the mob.</v>

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.753
<v Speaker 1>The mob is hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clowns and bomb seem to be getting </v>

19
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>trendier by the minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman may be the focus,</v>

20
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but his focus is on the city he loves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the process of saving Gotham,</v>

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>the film's raised questions about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of community.</v>

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>How does a society deal with fear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats?</v>

23
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>How does the presence of a hero like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman creates or threatened stability?</v>

24
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.193
<v Speaker 1>Can Society wide conflict ever be </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolved or is it inherently a cyclical </v>

25
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>

26
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>What about escalation escalation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start tearing semiautomatics day bio</v>

27
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.113
<v Speaker 2>waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dod wearing Kevlar body armor piercing </v>

28
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're wearing a mask?</v>

29
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Jumping off rooftops,</v>

30
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>help us understand Nolan's social </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

31
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>We're turning to perpetually stoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking anthropologists.</v>

32
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.673
<v Speaker 1>Rene's Gerard Gerard claims that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of [inaudible] is both the </v>

33
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:58.054
<v Speaker 1>foundation of all societies and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of conflict in those </v>

34
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:02.404
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerard's theory claims that one of the </v>

35
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>most basic aspects of our relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people is imitation.</v>

36
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Imitation can be as simple as copying </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's behavior.</v>

37
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I see you buying someone a bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>necklace and I think,</v>

38
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great idea,</v>

39
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 1>and I decided to go buy a necklace to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's happy,</v>

40
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this can become a problem.</v>

41
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Gerard says that imitation of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's behaviors can and often does lead</v>

42
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:27.604
<v Speaker 1>to replicating their desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I don't just want a </v>

43
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.324
<v Speaker 1>necklace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that necklace to one you happen </v>

44
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>to be wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is mimetic desire and it can pretty</v>

45
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:37.984
<v Speaker 1>quickly lead to rivalry where multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>people share the same desire and so </v>

46
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:43.870
<v Speaker 1>compete over finite resources.</v>

47
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.883
<v Speaker 1>Gerard claims that are human impulse </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward imitation means that eventually </v>

48
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:49.474
<v Speaker 1>more and more people will want that </v>
<v Speaker 1>necklace and rivalries will grow and </v>

49
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>multiply until they're also profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 1>impactful on the community itself.</v>

50
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.133
<v Speaker 1>When one succeeds in winning the prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other people or their tribes or </v>

51
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>their surviving family members seek </v>
<v Speaker 1>retaliation against the winter.</v>

52
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.073
<v Speaker 1>This vengeance is also a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitation and it basically ensures that </v>

53
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>rivalries and violence will continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

54
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>According to Gerard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the fundamental reason why there</v>

55
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>is crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

56
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>and war in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Batman begins begins.</v>

57
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>This turmoil is already established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because according to Gerard,</v>

58
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>this cycle goes all the way back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavemen,</v>

59
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.293
<v Speaker 1>but what's important to note here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we see individual examples of </v>

60
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>mummies occurring and motivating </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and most importantly it later</v>

61
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:39.694
<v Speaker 1>on we see Nolan used mimetic theory to </v>
<v Speaker 1>propose a possible solution to society </v>

62
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>wide violence.</v>

63
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.170
<v Speaker 1>So let's get started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>

64
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>This is most relevant in Batman begins </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it relates to the individual,</v>

65
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>especially in the creation of the Batman</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

66
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>The original instance of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one man's desire for the Wayne's</v>

67
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:00.514
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads to violence throughout the </v>

68
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan for grounds,</v>

69
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>fear and vengeance as powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivators,</v>

70
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>especially in a city as broken as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotham.</v>

71
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>We see this again in Bruce's imitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his parents.</v>

72
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:13.264
<v Speaker 1>Killer Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill in his effort to exact vengeance </v>

73
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.713
<v Speaker 1>versus time away from Gotham inspires </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to move away from the cycle of </v>

74
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>vengeance that motivated him to avenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>his parents.</v>

75
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uses invitation as a means of </v>

76
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.624
<v Speaker 1>stopping violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His fear of bats leads him to adopt the </v>

77
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:28.894
<v Speaker 1>identity of a bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he uses this invitation as a means </v>

78
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:36.541
<v Speaker 1>to spread the fear to criminals who now </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear a different kind of back him</v>

79
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.080
<v Speaker 3>watching your seeking justice.</v>

80
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>The League of shadows wants to press the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reset button on conflict by destroying a</v>

81
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>society altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really how it works.</v>

82
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.243
<v Speaker 1>The problem with their method is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching people destroy each other </v>

83
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>doesn't actually do anything to decrease</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

84
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.663
<v Speaker 1>It inflates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing for people to unite </v>

85
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whatever survivors are left after the</v>

86
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.694
<v Speaker 1>fire of London or the black plague or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the microwaving of Gotham art still </v>

87
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.284
<v Speaker 1>going to be really pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the League of shadows gets it </v>

88
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does Batman get right?</v>

89
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Even while Nolan presents us with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that it is difficult,</v>

90
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>if not impossible to break away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

91
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Roost spends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority of Batman begins struggling</v>

92
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>to overcome both his fears and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse for vengeance.</v>

93
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>It can't be personal where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>vigilante.</v>

94
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.153
<v Speaker 1>In order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that man has to transcend the identity </v>

95
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>of Bruce Wayne and become something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

96
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.913
<v Speaker 1>And image in the collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that represents justice </v>

97
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>without personal motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to become a symbol to be imitated</v>

98
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.893
<v Speaker 1>and it's this idea of symbols Gerard </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposes that can break society out of </v>

99
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.454
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

100
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the more individually focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes of Batman begins.</v>

101
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.853
<v Speaker 1>The dark knight transitions to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>social consequences of the rapid spread </v>

102
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>of rivalries and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the mobs ass whooping,</v>

103
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.533
<v Speaker 1>the city begins to push back against </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized crime and the faces of this </v>

104
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.404
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Rv Dent new district attorney and </v>

105
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:19.271
<v Speaker 1>got them White Knight and Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wait for it dark night while the bat</v>

106
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>fights with battery and Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lamborghinis Dent Fights,</v>

107
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>crime using the law as his weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The White Knight and the Dark Knight are</v>

108
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both inspire imitation.</v>

109
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>While dent inspires the rest of the city</v>
<v Speaker 1>government to aim for a safer Gotham,</v>

110
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Batman Inspires copycats in poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceived Halloween costumes.</v>

111
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.083
<v Speaker 1>Still those copycats are assigned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea of Batman inspires hope </v>

112
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>among the citizens of Gotham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a sign that those citizens are</v>

113
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>copying his tactic of replicating fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least trying to,</v>

114
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but the mob pushes back as mobs tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

115
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.033
<v Speaker 1>and the increasing escalation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict between the Knights and the </v>

116
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>criminals leads to Moroni.</v>

117
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.893
<v Speaker 1>Hiring the joker to kill Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the danger of the joker is that </v>

118
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>he only has power because of how afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mob is.</v>

119
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.993
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know why you choose to have these </v>

120
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>little group therapy sessions in broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>daylight.</v>

121
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I know why you're afraid to go out at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

122
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.503
<v Speaker 1>Batman Strategy for fighting crime has </v>
<v Speaker 1>created a monster one that feeds on the </v>

123
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 1>mimetic reproduction of fear that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>man relies on.</v>

124
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>So how can you break a cycle that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted to your methods of opposing?</v>

125
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.793
<v Speaker 1>Gerard tells us that when violence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance become so great that they </v>

126
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.664
<v Speaker 1>threatened the existence of the society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of people will quickly set </v>

127
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:44.834
<v Speaker 1>aside their differences in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice an individual the scapegoat </v>

128
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>whose death can restore temporary peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the community.</v>

129
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Everyone agrees that the whole thing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scapegoats fault and Bam,</v>

130
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned at the metaphorical steak.</v>

131
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.693
<v Speaker 1>And everyone chills out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since it's literally impossible for </v>

132
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>an immense social conflict to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely one person's fault,</v>

133
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>the scapegoat is a lie and a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent one at that.</v>

134
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.943
<v Speaker 1>So peace doesn't last long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually someone cupboards by </v>

135
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:13.194
<v Speaker 1>neighbors necklace all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerard says that since humans have an </v>

136
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:16.934
<v Speaker 1>innate impulse toward violence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivalry actually stopping those cycles </v>

137
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>of vengeance is basically impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With one exception,</v>

138
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.393
<v Speaker 1>we can replace the scapegoat goat with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ like figure who rejects violence </v>

139
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>and turn the other cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this could set a new imitative trend</v>

140
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.313
<v Speaker 1>of people desiring nonviolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Dent and his campaign for peace </v>

141
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:37.654
<v Speaker 1>in Gotham appear to fill that role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing a Christ figure for the </v>

142
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:43.020
<v Speaker 1>community to emulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in Harvey,</v>

143
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.413
<v Speaker 1>even Batman who can only fight violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>with violence supports a world where </v>

144
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 1>dent replaces him taking up the mantle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of crime,</v>

145
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>fighting without the need for grappling </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooks them off.</v>

146
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I could never be your stance against </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized crime.</v>

147
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the first legitimate ray of light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cousin in decades,</v>

148
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but the joker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a representation of the true violence of</v>

149
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>mankind shifts the course of the mimetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rivalry.</v>

150
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>And corrupts our Christ figure with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few oil drums and some sweet talk.</v>

151
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Once Harvey to face begins to imitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the joker,</v>

152
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>embracing chaos and going after Gordon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the corrupt cops,</v>

153
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.223
<v Speaker 1>he becomes subject to the cycles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence that the white knight was </v>

154
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>supposed to destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to restore peace to Gotham,</v>

155
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>we turned to the time honored tradition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the scapegoat.</v>

156
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.393
<v Speaker 1>Gotham picks an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not blames him for the current </v>

157
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>social ills in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crimes committed by two face and the</v>

158
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:38.784
<v Speaker 1>joker's presence and punishes him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to end the intense rivalries that </v>

159
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>threatened the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

160
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.263
<v Speaker 1>They don't kill Bruce Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they effectively killed the symbol </v>

161
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>of the bat and at least for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the period where Batman is gone,</v>

162
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>there is a time of relative peace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity in the city,</v>

163
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 1>but the scapegoat is always based on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

164
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.623
<v Speaker 1>The truth of the situation has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously suppressed in order to </v>

165
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:04.524
<v Speaker 1>achieve the desired effect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>containing the violent impulses of </v>

166
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

167
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:09.234
<v Speaker 1>this lie is unsustainable and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is the starting point of the </v>

168
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>dark knight rises.</v>

169
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Third film begins at a time of relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>tranquility,</v>

170
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:20.763
<v Speaker 1>brought on and sustained by the lie of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Dent's martyrdom and the </v>

171
00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:26.690
<v Speaker 1>scapegoating of Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is acknowledged by court,</v>

172
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.073
<v Speaker 1>wasn't needed anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want who just by recognizing the </v>

173
00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:34.444
<v Speaker 1>nature of the lie threatens the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability that depends on the mayor is </v>

174
00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>going to dump him in the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

175
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.450
<v Speaker 1>but he's a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war hero.</v>

176
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:44.284
<v Speaker 1>This is peace time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while the dent act made possible by </v>

177
00:10:47.111 --> 00:10:51.190
<v Speaker 1>the demonization of that man has </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively ended organized crime,</v>

178
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.100
<v Speaker 1>there are other kinds of violence still </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work in the city.</v>

179
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:59.020
<v Speaker 1>The social and economic inequalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>which defined the third film as one form</v>

180
00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:01.240
<v Speaker 1>of violence ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another begins,</v>

181
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.170
<v Speaker 1>although it's hardly fair to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>social inequality is a new phenomenon in</v>

182
00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Gotham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] were killed because of their</v>

183
00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:08.074
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the disillusion of the mob means </v>

184
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:10.474
<v Speaker 1>that the divides between the legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich and the poor are once again in the </v>

185
00:11:14.111 --> 00:11:17.170
<v Speaker 1>spotlight and violent rivalry is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

186
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I kind of wonder how you ever leave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for the rest like</v>

187
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.533
<v Speaker 1>the joker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bain is focused on revealing the </v>

188
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 1>violence that already exists in ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

189
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but while the joker explores the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

190
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Bain is interested in the concept of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

191
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.453
<v Speaker 1>There were big supplier with a false to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop tearing down this corrupt which </v>

192
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.613
<v Speaker 1>undoes the piece that on that lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disruption of the myth of the scape </v>

193
00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:57.314
<v Speaker 1>goat means that the sacrifice of Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer serves its purpose and its </v>

194
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 1>disappearance no longer helps the city</v>

195
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 1>because Batman's sacrificed himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to save the city from itself.</v>

196
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.653
<v Speaker 1>His return isn't as simple as hopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a flying car and catching the bad </v>

197
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.004
<v Speaker 1>guy to inspire the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to metaphorically come back from </v>

198
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.024
<v Speaker 1>the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is shown in his ascent out of the </v>

199
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:27.694
<v Speaker 1>pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot of birth </v>

200
00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>symbolism happening as he climbs out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hole into the sunlight.</v>

201
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.303
<v Speaker 1>But what's way more interesting is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit connection to rising from the </v>

202
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>dead and the comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The underground cave has another name,</v>

203
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.493
<v Speaker 1>the Lazarus pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not up to date with your new </v>

204
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:44.404
<v Speaker 1>testament stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lazarus is a dude who died and Jesus </v>

205
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:48.120
<v Speaker 1>brought him back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

206
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.963
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That simple,</v>

207
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 1>he rose from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coincidence,</v>

208
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since later on,</v>

209
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Gordon reads a eulogy from a tale of two</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities which describes,</v>

210
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.723
<v Speaker 1>you guessed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be Christ like sacrifice of one of the </v>

211
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 1>main characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan man,</v>

212
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you're killing it with these lit </v>
<v Speaker 1>references,</v>

213
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 1>and this leads us back to Gerard's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ figure.</v>

214
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.663
<v Speaker 1>He claims that in order to have real </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasting peace to remove our society and </v>

215
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:11.194
<v Speaker 1>ourselves from the cycle of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to set aside the myth of the </v>

216
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.323
<v Speaker 1>scapegoat and embrace a figure who sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>an example of selflessness that forms a </v>

217
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>new mimetic desire to be copied by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masses,</v>

218
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.373
<v Speaker 1>but even Gerard isn't sure that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>feasible if humans are driven by an </v>

219
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:27.934
<v Speaker 1>innate desire for violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't realistic to hope for something </v>

220
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:31.744
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerard says that even in today's </v>

221
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:34.264
<v Speaker 1>Christian communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't really follow Christ's </v>

222
00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one asks this question throughout the</v>

223
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:40.114
<v Speaker 1>trilogy is peace actually possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People battle their inner monsters and </v>

224
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 1>at the same time they're battling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters of Gotham,</v>

225
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 1>but can either of these ever find true </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution?</v>

226
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 1>It may appear that dent was a fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ figure.</v>

227
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the dark night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while Batman becomes a legitimate Christ</v>

228
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:58.660
<v Speaker 1>figure at the end of the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knight rises,</v>

229
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 1>but is this really the case?</v>

230
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 1>When Batman takes the bomb out over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

231
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>he saves the city from a very visible </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of violence,</v>

232
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the radioactive kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the piece that follows is also based</v>

233
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>in part on the lie that Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed his life to save the city.</v>

234
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>He gets a statue and the city gets a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>martyr,</v>

235
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.233
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the lie of Batman's death is </v>
<v Speaker 1>outweighed by another trip that unliked </v>

236
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:23.824
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really did fight violence with self </v>

237
00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the potential for a new kind of</v>

238
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:29.314
<v Speaker 1>mimetic desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can copy his motivations even if </v>

239
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 1>atomic bombs are in short supply.</v>

240
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.450
<v Speaker 3>That was the point</v>

241
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>and we see [inaudible] come full circle </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Joseph Gordon Levitt character who is</v>

242
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>revealed at the end of the film to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>none other than Robin.</v>

243
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Robin is introduced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Batman left him,</v>

244
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>all of his crime fighting tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests,</v>

245
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't prove that piece may not </v>
<v Speaker 1>last in Gotham,</v>

246
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>so how do we maintain stability in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities?</v>

247
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>The openness of the ending person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>

248
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.413
<v Speaker 1>robin in the bat cave and Batman all </v>
<v Speaker 1>statute up lead us in a number of </v>

249
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:09.884
<v Speaker 1>directions which is exactly Nolan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>point is a scape goat myth or a lie </v>

250
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.013
<v Speaker 1>necessary to maintain stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can a Christ figure really inspire </v>

251
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:19.244
<v Speaker 1>people to abandon their violent urges or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken Society never exist without </v>

252
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what we do.</v>

253
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.843
<v Speaker 1>Is there always a future crisis on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon ultimately to the limits of </v>

254
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.254
<v Speaker 1>human nature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prevent us from achieving lasting peace </v>

255
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>or does the human spirit's allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome whatever obstacles may arise?</v>

256
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>No one's later films like interstellar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Dunkirk.</v>

257
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.903
<v Speaker 1>Give us a peek into the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how and why we might transcend those </v>

258
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:45.524
<v Speaker 1>limits like constructing new worlds.</v>
