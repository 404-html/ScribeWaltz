1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and violence cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessed by headlines.</v>

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.763
<v Speaker 1>Headlines are about things that happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they give you no indication </v>

3
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever of how common a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity as a cause.</v>

4
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:19.160
<v Speaker 1>You'd never see reporter standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside a school saying,</v>

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I am in front of the Maplewood high</v>

6
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hasn't been shot up today.</v>

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.933
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or here I am in the capital of </v>

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Mozambican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no civil war.</v>

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>So forget headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.433
<v Speaker 1>the only way to answer the question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the trends in violence is to </v>

11
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:33.944
<v Speaker 1>look at data where you count the number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of occurrences as a proportion of the </v>

12
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:39.074
<v Speaker 1>number of opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see whether that's changed over </v>

13
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:42.014
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So since I wrote better angels of our </v>

14
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent it off to the press in,</v>

16
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of 2010.</v>

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>So the data that were available from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Warfarin,</v>

18
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>oh eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh nine,</v>

19
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep yearly updates on what's happened</v>

20
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:56.774
<v Speaker 1>to those trends.</v>

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.733
<v Speaker 1>And with the exception of civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which after a rollercoaster downward </v>

22
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>from the end of World War II has shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of an uptick,</v>

23
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Syrian civil war,</v>

24
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.883
<v Speaker 1>it's wiped out about 13 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress taking us back to the level of </v>

25
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 white,</v>

26
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>it's still a fraction of the level that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was at in the 60s,</v>

27
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>70s and 80s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you had not just,</v>

28
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>eight or nine civil wars going on at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

30
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>but a 25 or 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to forget them.</v>

32
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.490
<v Speaker 1>We tend to be amnesic about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.353
<v Speaker 1>all those nasty wars in Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia that were going on in </v>

34
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the seventies and eighties.</v>

35
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of them had a considerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>death tall.</v>

36
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's clearly things have gotten worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

37
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've gotten worse in Ukraine and,</v>

38
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

39
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the global trend has not,</v>

40
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse the progress that we have seen </v>

41
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:49.454
<v Speaker 1>by any means.</v>

42
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Then all the other trends such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>homicide,</v>

43
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>which kills far more people than wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>continues to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexual violence,</v>

45
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>at least in countries that have good </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

46
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:00.740
<v Speaker 1>have continued to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rape and domestic violence.</v>

47
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:01.574
<v Speaker 1>Child abuse has continued to go down </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more states and countries have </v>

48
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:09.371
<v Speaker 1>abolished capital punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even democratization of government.</v>

49
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.633
<v Speaker 1>The absence of government violence where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're aware of backsliding in countries </v>

50
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 1>like Venezuela and that Turkey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

51
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.283
<v Speaker 1>but still the global trend continues to </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat that the world is getting more </v>

52
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:21.254
<v Speaker 1>democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't read about the countries that </v>

53
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.590
<v Speaker 1>have liberalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we hear about the countries that are</v>

54
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>increased their repression and that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do exist.</v>

55
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:28.124
<v Speaker 1>But on the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world has become more democratic as </v>

56
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>well as less homicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender based violence,</v>

59
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>less child abuse and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

60
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the category of war,</v>

61
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you can divide wars into wars between </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

62
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.103
<v Speaker 1>Old fashioned wars of country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a declares war on country B and civil </v>

63
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.440
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

64
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>the first category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstate wars,</v>

66
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government on each side has been in,</v>

67
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of sputtering decline for many </v>

68
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>there are and fewer wars between </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

70
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.650
<v Speaker 1>The wars that exist are civil wars and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.880
<v Speaker 1>that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>that record has continued to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

73
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.061
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

76
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>namely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had zero interstate wars since the</v>

77
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>better angels of our nature was </v>
<v Speaker 1>published.</v>

78
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had zero interstate wars since the</v>

79
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>American invasion of Iraq in 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And historically,</v>

80
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>wars between countries tend to kill more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people than civil wars.</v>

81
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>So even with the backsliding that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in,</v>

82
00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of civil war,</v>

83
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>in the case of the most destructive form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wars,</v>

84
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the world is still not seeing a return </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

85
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>The battle days of the seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
