00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>There's one way to be rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many ways to be irrational.</v>

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 1>We could be irrational by getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused,</v>

3
00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>not taking actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being myopic,</v>

4
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>vindictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of ways to be wrong.</v>

6
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not one way to fix it.</v>

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>But one interesting way to try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inject some rationality is to think from</v>

8
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:26.464
<v Speaker 1>an outsider's perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happens when you think </v>

9
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:30.604
<v Speaker 1>about your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trapped within your own </v>

10
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:32.914
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tribe within your own emotions and </v>

11
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>feelings and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you give advice to somebody else,</v>

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>all the sudden you're not trapped within</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emotional,</v>

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination,</v>

14
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>mishmash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity.</v>

15
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.053
<v Speaker 1>And you can give advice that is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward looking and not so specific to </v>

16
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:54.394
<v Speaker 1>the emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one idea is to basically ask people </v>

17
00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>for advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're falling in love with some,</v>

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.063
<v Speaker 1>some person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good advice is to go to your mother </v>

19
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:05.891
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

20
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatibility of that person?</v>

21
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>You're infatuated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:12.484
<v Speaker 1>When you're infatuated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not able to see things three </v>

23
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months down the road.</v>

24
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm infatuated.</v>

25
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll stay in fragile forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will never go away.</v>

26
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Your mother being an outsider is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>infatuated.</v>

27
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And she could probably look at things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like longterm compatibility and so on,</v>

28
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's other ways to do it,</v>

29
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>which is not to be advisors to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

30
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but to be advisors for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

31
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>in one experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

32
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>we asked people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

33
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went to your doctor,</v>

34
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.223
<v Speaker 1>they gave you this diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that the thing that the doctor </v>

35
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>recommended is much more expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other things that will be much</v>

36
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh?</v>

37
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Would you go for a second opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>

38
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my doctor recommended it.</v>

39
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>How could I not take their advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I say?</v>

40
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Can you please refer me for a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion?</v>

41
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Then we asked another group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

42
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this happened to your friend,</v>

43
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>would you recommend that they go for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second opinion?</v>

44
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>People said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

45
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:12.490
<v Speaker 1>How could you not go for a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion?</v>

46
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>So one idea is to try and get ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an outside perspective.</v>

47
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>You look at the situation and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say to yourself,</v>

48
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>if this was about somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the I love and care about,</v>

49
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this situation,</v>

50
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

51
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.713
<v Speaker 1>what would I advise them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you would realize that often your </v>

52
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>advice will be different and often a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more rational,</v>

53
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>useful perspective.</v>
