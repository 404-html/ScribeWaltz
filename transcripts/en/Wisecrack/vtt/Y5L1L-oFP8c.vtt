<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brainy.</v>

3
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.923
<v Speaker 1>and today we're talking about the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>season of one of the most cerebral </v>

5
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>enemies out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychopaths tonight,</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>not just cut a when you kiddish data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>she still sick and each coteau auto to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to her daycare.</v>

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 2>What about yours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the digital economy in?</v>

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking to each other by quoting</v>

10
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:36.614
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set in a dystopian Japan where </v>

11
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 1>everything is controlled by a seemingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscient computer.</v>

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.603
<v Speaker 1>The civil system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths asked some pretty hefty </v>

13
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mainly,</v>

14
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>is it possible for a computer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine everything about us?</v>

15
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Does she could see it so she didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sick guy just against this,</v>

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.833
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would we want to live in a society </v>

17
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:15.061
<v Speaker 1>without freewill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't cook with.</v>

18
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Does she get out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know that well,</v>

19
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.943
<v Speaker 1>as it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this question isn't just about </v>

20
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also science.</v>

21
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up and let disembodied.</v>

22
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.204
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain how the civil system just might </v>

23
00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>suggest that freewill is a neurological </v>
<v Speaker 1>and societal illusion in this wise crack</v>

24
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>addition on the science and philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychopaths and cues.</v>

25
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Sirens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do with spoilers,</v>

26
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:50.134
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also covering all the sexy smart stuff </v>

27
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>in this series would be impossible to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one video,</v>

28
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to hear jared break it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down some more,</v>

29
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>let us know in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

30
00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the uninitiated.</v>

31
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.053
<v Speaker 1>In the world of psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil system determines everything </v>

32
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:04.594
<v Speaker 1>about you from your job to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood that you'll commit a crime </v>

33
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>all by constantly scanning your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keeping you under surveillance.</v>

34
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.823
<v Speaker 1>This handy Dandy all encompassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading is called your psychopaths and </v>

35
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 1>it's what the civil system uses to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these decisions about you</v>

36
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>email system in your home that you knew.</v>

37
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.593
<v Speaker 1>Enter a Kanye soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amaury a Newbie inspector at the </v>

38
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Criminal Investigations Department or </v>
<v Speaker 1>CID.</v>

39
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like being a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except instead of following the law,</v>

40
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>you're following the systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

41
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>demo mother that she beat us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still couldn't,</v>

42
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.923
<v Speaker 1>and instead of police dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get enforcers who were basically </v>

43
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.864
<v Speaker 1>would be criminals that the system has </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted limited freedom to in exchange </v>

44
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not a lot.</v>

45
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>You might think that a legal system </v>
<v Speaker 1>based off a computer scanning your brain</v>

46
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:07.984
<v Speaker 1>is some minority report level bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have free will so you shouldn't be </v>

47
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>arrested before you actually commit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

48
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>let me stop you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As psychopaths illustrates,</v>

50
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

51
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>we have to understand what the brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decision making process really is.</v>

52
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Most neuroscientists today think there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are two systems in the brain.</v>

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>The first system is us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little voice in our heads,</v>

54
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>those emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel all those thoughts.</v>

55
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>We think it's the stuff we're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of when we make a decision.</v>

56
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>This is the system where we like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it happens,</v>

57
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's not entirely the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Below this system is another system,</v>

58
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.783
<v Speaker 1>a huge lattice work of neurons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls everything from spatial </v>

59
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>processing to breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>

60
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>this second system is a black box.</v>

61
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much armchair </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophizing we do,</v>

62
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.523
<v Speaker 1>we can't penetrate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the science of free </v>

63
00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>will comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

64
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.233
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Benjamin Lavette conducted a pretty </v>

65
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.474
<v Speaker 1>groundbreaking experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked subjects to look at a clock </v>

66
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.013
<v Speaker 1>then at a time of their own choosing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flick the wrist labelle then recorded </v>

67
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.304
<v Speaker 1>the electrical impulses from their brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the readiness potential and </v>

68
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>compared it with the time the subjects </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed they made the decision to flick</v>

69
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.534
<v Speaker 1>their wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The results readiness potential </v>

70
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.324
<v Speaker 1>proceeded the subject's awareness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the decision by about half a </v>

71
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

72
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.783
<v Speaker 1>the decision to flick their wrist </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened somewhere in the unconscious </v>

73
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>system about half a second before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they made the decision.</v>

74
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.213
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like funder following lightning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and while labettes experiment wasn't </v>

75
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>without flaws like how he relied on self</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting,</v>

76
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.003
<v Speaker 1>it's important to note that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>researchers have borne out similar </v>

77
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:44.914
<v Speaker 1>results and experiments that were better</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled when we can't say for sure </v>

78
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>that there's a causal relationship here.</v>

79
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.793
<v Speaker 1>We can say that on some level it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the decision making process begins </v>

80
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>in this unconscious part of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes you wonder,</v>

81
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>are we really completely in control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the choices we make and if we're not,</v>

82
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.973
<v Speaker 1>how can we say their ours labettes </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment goes a long way in making </v>

83
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>sense of psychopaths is world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

84
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>why would anyone let a computer make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>preemptive judgments about them ordering</v>

85
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>every facet of their lives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.093
<v Speaker 1>because a very smart computer like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil system can have a deep </v>

87
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.634
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the brain's black box </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense knowing is better than we </v>

88
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:21.964
<v Speaker 1>know ourselves held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system knows the inner workings of </v>

89
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:24.844
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious mind so well that it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>even identify likely criminals as </v>

90
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:28.354
<v Speaker 1>toddlers,</v>

91
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 3>both either cycle bus as she got a coco </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do in a</v>

92
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.523
<v Speaker 1>sense the relationship between the civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and its citizens is parallel to </v>

93
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the two systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our brain,</v>

94
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the citizens mole about with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>

95
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:48.434
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeming choices while literally </v>

96
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.870
<v Speaker 1>thousands of feet below their feet is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vast network of sensors,</v>

97
00:05:53.871 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>processors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fiber optic cables.</v>

98
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>All in charge of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if our unconscious mind is affecting</v>

99
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>our conscious decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to wonder what then is affecting</v>

100
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.753
<v Speaker 1>our unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're here subliminal messages </v>

101
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love Logan,</v>

102
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we actually going to like him?</v>

103
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.353
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil system takes the question of </v>

104
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>what can affect its citizens minds very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

105
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.143
<v Speaker 1>The system is practically obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping the mental states of its </v>

106
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>citizenry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeaky clean,</v>

107
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>so much so that it measures the stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of public spaces constantly.</v>

108
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Imagine walking around the mall </v>
<v Speaker 1>peacefully,</v>

109
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>minding your own business when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths reading changes and this guy</v>

110
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>comes up to you with this obsession of </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping its citizens healthy.</v>

111
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.313
<v Speaker 1>It's also not surprising that the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>will also black out the press for the </v>

112
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:39.974
<v Speaker 1>public good consumers and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>without saying that other forms of </v>

113
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>expression like music and art are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited.</v>

114
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty much an Orwellian </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare of the first degree,</v>

115
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but as the simple system wrong to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control freedom of speech</v>

116
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.090
<v Speaker 4>because you're a to you guys to go with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you so you can join or</v>

117
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.890
<v Speaker 1>homelands handled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chibe,</v>

118
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>does she still have some on some other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as frightening as it may sound,</v>

119
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.100
<v Speaker 1>science at least might say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

120
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.910
<v Speaker 1>human beings are world class imitators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so good.</v>

121
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:22.744
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we do it innately without even </v>

122
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:25.144
<v Speaker 1>realizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Research performed by Andrew Meltzoff </v>

123
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.180
<v Speaker 1>has shown that infants imitate even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most ludicrous of actions.</v>

124
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen month olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

125
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.963
<v Speaker 1>we'll do dumped like use their foreheads</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of their fingers to turn on the </v>

126
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>touch sensor light simply by watching an</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult do it.</v>

127
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.623
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence to suggest that </v>

128
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:42.334
<v Speaker 1>children are such good imitators because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parts of their brain that control </v>

129
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:45.874
<v Speaker 1>inhibition aren't fully developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because we're not wearing </v>

130
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>diapers doesn't mean adults are any less</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to imitate their peers.</v>

131
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.853
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are so susceptible to imitation </v>

132
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.993
<v Speaker 1>it just perceiving an action performed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by another person will drastically </v>

133
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>increase the likelihood of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>emulating it.</v>

134
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.943
<v Speaker 1>This is called the chameleon effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has to do with a special set of </v>

135
00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:06.784
<v Speaker 1>brain cells called mirror neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which fire when we watch others' </v>

136
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.263
<v Speaker 1>performance action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes on during all of our </v>

137
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.380
<v Speaker 1>interactions without us ever noticing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

138
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.423
<v Speaker 1>and that's the key takeaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens automatically and </v>

139
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:22.150
<v Speaker 1>subconsciously it happens in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable system of our brain.</v>

140
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.380
<v Speaker 1>So why would the symbol system need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack down on crime before crime happens</v>

141
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.333
<v Speaker 1>because behavior is contagious and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means everything from laughing to </v>

142
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>violence and when we're exposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder,</v>

143
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.370
<v Speaker 1>even in the regular world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are consequences,</v>

144
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.400
<v Speaker 1>and this seems to be the case in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of psychopaths.</v>

145
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.323
<v Speaker 1>When the city is flooded with low grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals wearing helmets that stopped </v>

146
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:45.070
<v Speaker 1>the civil system from reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're psychopaths.</v>

147
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 1>We see violence spread to the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens within almost gleeful contagion</v>

148
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good one,</v>

149
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.410
<v Speaker 1>nosy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

150
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 5>go to Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both ads about it.</v>

151
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:04.160
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what hit them at the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>

152
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.170
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go to the shoot on bulk or Chico state</v>

153
00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:09.560
<v Speaker 5>or</v>

154
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.393
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's in your brain or on the </v>

155
00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:14.540
<v Speaker 1>streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that the civil system is bent</v>

156
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>on removing agency from its citizens.</v>

157
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 2>She be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.543
<v Speaker 2>Eight kids still as you want a night </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of kids done three ish almost </v>

159
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.230
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

160
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is where we get to the question</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the heart of psychopaths.</v>

161
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.340
<v Speaker 1>What is the value of living in a society</v>
<v Speaker 1>without freewill?</v>

162
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly this question that drives </v>
<v Speaker 1>showgirl Moxie map.</v>

163
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.113
<v Speaker 1>This first seasons antagonist maximized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven to test the value of freewill in </v>

164
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:39.580
<v Speaker 1>a society where it's been rendered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless</v>

165
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 2>selling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know to Thomas,</v>

166
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.520
<v Speaker 2>he knew he needed community today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geeky stuff,</v>

167
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.803
<v Speaker 2>so no hunting touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know annual [inaudible] your needs in </v>

168
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:05.711
<v Speaker 2>Taco bell could still no Thomasina sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of got home.</v>

169
00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Tony told him I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's your typical Tomas.</v>

170
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Islam told us touching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cuts you out</v>

171
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 1>in positing the necessity of freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Shimo borrows a page from wisecrack</v>

172
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.083
<v Speaker 1>favorite Emmanuel Kant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who believes that you can only be moral </v>

173
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.650
<v Speaker 1>by following moral laws out of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>free will and Moxie.</v>

174
00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Mark goes to insane links to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of people's will.</v>

175
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.683
<v Speaker 1>Enabling criminal after criminal who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to test their will against the </v>

176
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Mark Shima is the batty.</v>

177
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.263
<v Speaker 1>So does that mean a believes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite is she the symbol systems </v>

178
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:43.344
<v Speaker 1>number one fan going all in for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that freewill must be squashed </v>

179
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 1>for the greater collective good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

180
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.093
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the series a connie displays </v>

181
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.823
<v Speaker 1>a unique sense of individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was such a good student that the </v>

182
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>system determined she'd be a good fit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally any industry.</v>

183
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the.</v>

184
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.373
<v Speaker 1>And after she joined the CID,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Conay early on questions the merit of </v>

185
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 1>blindly following the civil systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders,</v>

186
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>culminating with her disobeying her </v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses order to kill her enforcer,</v>

187
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Shinya Coca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

188
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Hon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xy cases that take your assignments.</v>

189
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And although she begrudgingly allows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system to remain by the end of the first</v>

190
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does so on her own terms,</v>

191
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.573
<v Speaker 1>each that I see me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to get any city in this </v>

192
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:38.341
<v Speaker 1>sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

193
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Connie represents a sort of middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

194
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.213
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the unconscious mind or the civil </v>

195
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:43.584
<v Speaker 1>system influences her decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately they're still hers to </v>

196
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 1>make despite reaffirming a system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>strips her of some agency.</v>

197
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.233
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connie herself manages to preserve the </v>

198
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>semblance free will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the end,</v>

199
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>a con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't actually stop mocks Yuma.</v>

200
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.053
<v Speaker 1>That role falls to Kokanee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we could say a lot about why </v>

201
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Moctezuma values Koga me so much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a connie,</v>

202
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.113
<v Speaker 1>but I think it has to do with this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting the civil system dictate your </v>

203
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:29.684
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcsema believes you stop becoming an </v>

204
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:34.160
<v Speaker 1>individual without free will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a human,</v>

205
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.320
<v Speaker 1>but merely a cog in the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why.</v>

206
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Kogi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who willing to live as a </v>

207
00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:40.244
<v Speaker 1>fugitive from the system in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop mock Cima is the only one mcsema </v>

208
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.260
<v Speaker 1>cares about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the seasons end.</v>

209
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Cogan may is the only one who acts </v>
<v Speaker 1>freely,</v>

210
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.763
<v Speaker 1>and in this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the only one mock Shima has a real </v>

211
00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:52.400
<v Speaker 1>relationship with in this world.</v>

212
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 6>Both</v>

213
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.400
<v Speaker 1>what makes the world of psychopaths so </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening is that unlike other shows,</v>

214
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.780
<v Speaker 1>this dystopian society isn't the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of paranoia or crisis management,</v>

215
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.450
<v Speaker 1>but of scientific progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think is freewill,</v>

216
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.353
<v Speaker 1>all that great or even real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or would we all be better off letting a </v>

217
00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:27.000
<v Speaker 1>super computer called the shots?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

218
00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I've over free will and letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers only check email,</v>

219
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.603
<v Speaker 1>stay ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant dot or will help me train my </v>

220
00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:35.400
<v Speaker 1>brain through curated sequences of fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>arcade style questions in logic,</v>

221
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 1>linear Algebra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical mechanics,</v>

222
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:38.700
<v Speaker 1>artificial neural networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>

223
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.683
<v Speaker 1>These modules test critical thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis skills that could apply to the </v>

224
00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:42.954
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to learn more about our </v>

225
00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:45.054
<v Speaker 1>future overlords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd recommend their module all machine </v>

226
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>learning which breaks down how </v>
<v Speaker 1>supercomputer succeed in analyzing data.</v>

227
00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:53.310
<v Speaker 1>We're humans fall short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so develop your critical thinking and go</v>
