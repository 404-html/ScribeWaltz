1
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.653
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pilot season continues here at wise </v>

2
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.094
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this one is special to us for a </v>

3
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:11.294
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about real world events rather </v>

5
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>than focusing on media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.453
<v Speaker 1>we're bringing the vision of one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite artists to life is the girl </v>

7
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.394
<v Speaker 1>went to college with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her name is Tyler Rice and we're super </v>

8
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>excited to have her aesthetic be part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wise crack family,</v>

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>but also I wanted to introduce the voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this pilot,</v>

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.523
<v Speaker 1>Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is my co founder who created </v>

11
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack with me about four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>

12
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>we're really pumped to get this out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

13
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:33.884
<v Speaker 1>so let us know what you think in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments and make sure you let Larry </v>

14
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>know to see you guys later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy the show.</v>

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the news lately?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.913
<v Speaker 2>Today's media landscape gives people </v>
<v Speaker 2>more ways than ever to hear only the </v>

17
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.754
<v Speaker 2>things they want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When confronted with ideas that </v>

18
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 2>challenged their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many react with outrage,</v>

19
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 2>censorship and recently cries of fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 2>This trend may seem to have popped out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nowhere,</v>

21
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.353
<v Speaker 2>but this was actually predicted a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago in a book you've probably read </v>

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 400.</v>

23
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Do you want in case you slept through </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle school English.</v>

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.283
<v Speaker 3>The book depicts a dark future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or firemen have graduated from saving </v>

25
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.244
<v Speaker 3>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The torching books in an attempt to </v>

26
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:22.734
<v Speaker 3>silence any troubling ideas Fahrenheit </v>
<v Speaker 3>is usually interpreted as an attack on </v>

27
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:27.804
<v Speaker 3>government censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially since Brad re wrote the book </v>

28
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 3>in the midst of Mccarthy's war on </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism,</v>

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
<v Speaker 3>but there's actually someone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bradbury blames for the dystopia his </v>

30
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 3>characters live in you.</v>

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Well not only you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of us.</v>

32
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.003
<v Speaker 2>See in the book the main characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed that it was the public that </v>

33
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:46.844
<v Speaker 2>censored themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all started with the advent of mass </v>

34
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:50.564
<v Speaker 2>media technology advanced to such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that people struggled to keep up </v>

35
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rushed in from every direction,</v>

36
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming the population to quell </v>
<v Speaker 2>their anxiety.</v>

37
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 2>People focused on smaller pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

38
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.243
<v Speaker 2>Beatty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>captain of the firefighters describes </v>

39
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.524
<v Speaker 2>this change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how media has been reduced from </v>

40
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>cumbersome novels to the gag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The snap ending one column,</v>

41
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 2>two sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a headline than midair all vanishes just</v>

42
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 2>like that we consume and forget and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consume.</v>

43
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rinse,</v>

44
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 2>wash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeat the mind drinks less and less</v>

45
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 3>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People became addicts,</v>

46
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 3>conditioned to feel pleasure from </v>
<v Speaker 3>frivolous content.</v>

47
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Anything thought provoking became </v>
<v Speaker 3>downright painful.</v>

48
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.073
<v Speaker 3>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people censored themselves from any </v>

49
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 3>challenging ideas they sought to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>pacified,</v>

50
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 3>numbed and validated soundbites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>factoids,</v>

51
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 3>and vapid drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blurring out any troubling ideas blaring</v>

52
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 3>out reality.</v>

53
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.063
<v Speaker 2>We see similar patterns with the rise of</v>
<v Speaker 2>social networking and the feed news </v>

54
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 2>story after new story that generates as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you scroll video after video,</v>

55
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 2>meme after meme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly fed and programs to your liking</v>

56
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>just as long as you continue scrolling </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Fahrenheit,</v>

57
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.463
<v Speaker 2>the media concluded that it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>attract the biggest audience by routing </v>

58
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything controversial,</v>

59
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>effectively ceding control of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>content to outrage our media.</v>

60
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Saturated society is an extension of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bradbury's vision with so many different</v>

61
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>channels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>streaming services and websites,</v>

62
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 2>media has fragmented each appealing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own individual audiences.</v>

63
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.493
<v Speaker 2>Fox News for conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC for liberals and Youtube for flat </v>

64
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>earthers get each of these media outlets</v>
<v Speaker 2>must pander to their audience,</v>

65
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>which is why Fox News can't piss off </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream republicans,</v>

66
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:42.391
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals and NRA members and Msnbc </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't piss off mainstream Democrats,</v>

67
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gun control advocates.</v>

68
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 3>The result is isolated bubbles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>become harder and harder to burst.</v>

69
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like beatty said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offended as few as possible.</v>

70
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.660
<v Speaker 3>The truth is secondary to comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once someone finds their bubble,</v>

71
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 3>don't label anything that challenges </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideas</v>

72
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 2>as fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in the book and in real life.</v>

73
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.230
<v Speaker 2>People protect themselves from anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that confounds or upsets.</v>

74
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Speaker 2>They just want to continue watching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scrolling and watching and scrolling,</v>

75
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.230
<v Speaker 2>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrolling.</v>

76
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.233
<v Speaker 2>So what happens next in Fahrenheit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's here that the government steps in </v>

77
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 2>encouraging everyone to stay in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble and torch any stragglers.</v>

78
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.583
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we destined for a similar fate or </v>

79
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 2>will the champions of free thought save </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault?</v>

80
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
