00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Hey boys cry if you didn't catch my </v>
<v Speaker 1>science of one punch man video.</v>

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>My name is Helen and I'm here to up wise</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracks science games.</v>

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>So thanks to brilliant.org</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sponsoring this video and join us as</v>

4
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.764
<v Speaker 1>we talk about everyone's favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>holiday that institutionalizes the </v>

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>extermination of the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purge,</v>

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.273
<v Speaker 1>the purge is an annual free for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime spree that in theory allow </v>

7
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:27.274
<v Speaker 1>citizens to rid their wretched soul was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep seated desires by doing all the </v>

8
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.284
<v Speaker 1>murdering and pillaging they want for 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours without having to worry about the </v>

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.431
<v Speaker 1>Popo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.264
<v Speaker 1>the government and the purge obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>has social cleansing at the top of its </v>

11
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

12
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:45.141
<v Speaker 1>the citizens aren't killing enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we supplement at all</v>

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>to keep things balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ostensible reason for the holiday is</v>

14
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.290
<v Speaker 1>that if we can be super key for just one</v>
<v Speaker 1>day a year,</v>

15
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>we can behave like model citizens for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other 364 but would it work?</v>

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Can venting our anger somehow make us </v>
<v Speaker 1>less aggressive,</v>

17
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>sharpen your hacksaws and cock your </v>
<v Speaker 1>glocks kids.</v>

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.803
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a look in this special </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack edition of the psychology of </v>

19
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>the purge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always spoilers ahead.</v>

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 1>The first film opens in a swanky </v>
<v Speaker 1>suburban utopia somewhere outside of la.</v>

21
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>The media is fired up about purge night </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's super bowl Sunday,</v>

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.843
<v Speaker 1>encouraging citizens everywhere to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>their civic duty and release the beast </v>

23
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:23.794
<v Speaker 1>when the clock strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven American streets will be running </v>

24
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>red tonight when people release the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast in record numbers of Kelly getting</v>

25
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>one last walk in before lockdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>After all the experts say humans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>innately violent creatures,</v>

27
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be anything otherwise is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deny our true nature.</v>

28
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.993
<v Speaker 2>The purge not only contained societal </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence to a single evening at the </v>

29
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:45.284
<v Speaker 2>countrywide catharsis creates </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological stability by letting us </v>

30
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>release the aggression we all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of us.</v>

31
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.603
<v Speaker 1>So what is Catharsis anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychology defines catharsis as the </v>

32
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>process of experiencing emotional relief</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the release of pent up feelings,</v>

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.793
<v Speaker 1>especially pity for fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The concept comes from the Greek word </v>

34
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:04.564
<v Speaker 1>for purification or cleansing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It dates back to the days of Aristotle </v>

35
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.063
<v Speaker 1>who postulated that watching tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>performances couldn't do such intense </v>

36
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:13.234
<v Speaker 1>feelings of pity or fear that viewers </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ultimately be cleansed of these </v>

37
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:17.284
<v Speaker 1>emotions and his work politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle writes those who were subject </v>

38
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>to the emotions of the fitting and fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>will necessarily be affected in the same</v>

39
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:26.194
<v Speaker 1>way and so will other men in exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion to their susceptibility to </v>

40
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:30.814
<v Speaker 1>such emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll experience a certain purge </v>

41
00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:33.994
<v Speaker 1>catharsis and pleasant release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new founding fathers had been </v>

42
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>feeding this idea to the masses for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>

43
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:40.114
<v Speaker 1>By the time the first movie opens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the otherwise benign sanded family </v>

44
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:44.194
<v Speaker 1>is down with the purge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't exactly surprising </v>

45
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:47.194
<v Speaker 1>considering James Profits big time from </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling security systems to his fellow </v>

46
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>well-healed suburbanites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naturally,</v>

47
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.373
<v Speaker 1>James Repeats this logic to his son </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie saying that grownups have to </v>

48
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:57.274
<v Speaker 1>purge some times to get rid of all their</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional gunk and that it's okay to </v>

49
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>kill people for one night of the year if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lifts your spirits.</v>

50
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.543
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this is difficult to understand </v>

51
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:06.344
<v Speaker 3>that your age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but tonight allows people a release for </v>

52
00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:11.204
<v Speaker 3>all the hatred and violence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression that they keep up inside </v>

53
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

54
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.933
<v Speaker 1>The series also is loaded with baptismal</v>
<v Speaker 1>language with people justifying their </v>

55
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 1>actions with words like cleanse our </v>
<v Speaker 1>souls.</v>

56
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Be Aware of about a thousand years or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>after aristotle made his claim about the</v>

57
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Cathartic benefits of theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send bs thing,</v>

58
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:34.530
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aficionado,</v>

59
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.383
<v Speaker 1>Sigmund Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes that were pressing certain </v>

60
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>kinds of negative emotions could lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the buildup of phobias,</v>

61
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the stereo or nervous outbursts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One possible solution,</v>

62
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>discharging the emotion by doing unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>others as they have to you.</v>

63
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance in there,</v>

64
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.104
<v Speaker 1>1895 book studies on hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud and his psych roadshows of Gloria </v>

65
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.843
<v Speaker 1>Rhodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reaction of an injured person to a </v>

66
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>trauma has really only a cathartic </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect if it is expressed in an adequate</v>

67
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:00.694
<v Speaker 1>reaction like event Brite embroiders </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas on Catharsis for the foundation </v>

68
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:05.194
<v Speaker 1>for the hydraulic model of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What suggested frustrations lead to </v>

69
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.154
<v Speaker 1>anger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger leads to the buildup of negative </v>

70
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 1>emotions and built up negative emotions.</v>

71
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.803
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately lead to an explosion of rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one where you might have just one of </v>

72
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might go over off.</v>

73
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.853
<v Speaker 1>The theories that built on this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested that we ought to drain our </v>

74
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>anger little by little rather than let </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all out at once.</v>

75
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.963
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea is at odds with the type of </v>

76
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>catharsis that's encouraged in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purge,</v>

77
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.553
<v Speaker 1>which is more like saving up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion of hostility rather than a </v>

78
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>steady drain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the new founding fathers concept has</v>

79
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:38.404
<v Speaker 1>support in a theory by a quintet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists who published a book </v>

80
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.124
<v Speaker 1>called the frustration and aggression in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1939 the work postulates the aggression </v>

81
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.714
<v Speaker 1>is a consequence of frustration and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive acts lead to a reduction in </v>

82
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>aggressive drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes it less likely that one will</v>

83
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:55.700
<v Speaker 1>act like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inequality.</v>

84
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it could have come </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight from the new founding fathers,</v>

85
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and author Dorothy Brook </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roche.</v>

86
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>When Pasa cumulates and forms an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abscess,</v>

87
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the abscess must be opened and drained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this is not done,</v>

88
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.013
<v Speaker 1>the infection spreads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end it may destroy the </v>

89
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so with feelings,</v>

90
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.983
<v Speaker 1>the badness must come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hurts and fears and anger must be </v>

91
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>released and drain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

92
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>these two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they destroyed me.</v>

93
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:21.724
<v Speaker 1>Individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This so called Catharsis hypothesis was </v>

94
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>accepted until researchers actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>started studying it and one of the first</v>

95
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>experiments conducted by psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Howard Hornberger,</v>

96
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.703
<v Speaker 1>a group of participants were insulted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then half of them were told to hammer </v>

97
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>nails for 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physical manifestation venting.</v>

98
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.603
<v Speaker 1>Afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were given the chance to criticize </v>

99
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the person who did assaulted them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the Catharsis theory held true,</v>

100
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.613
<v Speaker 1>then pounding the nails would make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgrace participants less aggressive </v>

101
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>toward the insults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

102
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.183
<v Speaker 1>the opposite happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones who'd hammered nails were </v>

103
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>actually more hostile.</v>

104
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.683
<v Speaker 1>Subsequent research turned up mixed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catharsis hypothesis and according </v>

105
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:00.524
<v Speaker 1>to our review of the evidence conducted </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Russell Geen and Michael Conti in </v>

106
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:03.944
<v Speaker 1>1977 a lot of the studies that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicated that aggressive behavior </v>

107
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 1>reduced once tendency for violence had </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodological issues and when </v>

108
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>replicated the results were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

109
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.953
<v Speaker 1>Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quanti ultimately concluded that the </v>

110
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:21.101
<v Speaker 1>notion of Catharsis had not confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologist Brad Bushman revisited this</v>

111
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>idea in 2002 after having someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulted group of participants,</v>

112
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.143
<v Speaker 1>he had them either sit quietly in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>punching bag with the aim of getting </v>

113
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:29.474
<v Speaker 1>physically fit or hit a punching bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>while thinking about the person who </v>

114
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:32.894
<v Speaker 1>would insulted them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he gave them a chance to confront </v>

115
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:35.714
<v Speaker 1>their and salter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who sat quietly were least likely </v>

116
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:38.594
<v Speaker 1>to be aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while those who had thought about the </v>

117
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>person who insulted them with the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be aggressive.</v>

118
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.963
<v Speaker 1>The ones who hit the bag without </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the insult or we're </v>

119
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in between.</v>

120
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.013
<v Speaker 1>This suggests that while getting all </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked up from exercise might have </v>

121
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>increased aggression compared to sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly,</v>

122
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.923
<v Speaker 1>ruminating while acting out aggressively</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the most likely to amplify anger </v>

123
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>overall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A contrast to the catharsis hypothesis,</v>

124
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.483
<v Speaker 1>Bushman rights venting to reduce anger </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like using gasoline to put out a </v>

125
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only feeds the flame.</v>

126
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there any evidence that Catharsis</v>

127
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>is a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe according to gene and Quanti,</v>

128
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>there are circumstances where angered </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do seem to calm down if they have</v>

129
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>the chance to retaliate against their </v>
<v Speaker 1>provoker,</v>

130
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.733
<v Speaker 1>but the context is pretty specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The retaliation should be justified and </v>

131
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>the target can't be intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

132
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.233
<v Speaker 1>expressing anger can be temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>calming if you aren't left feeling </v>

133
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.653
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty or afraid that you were about to </v>

134
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:31.844
<v Speaker 1>get your ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should also be noted that in the </v>

135
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:34.504
<v Speaker 1>study cited here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bushman's experiments only look to </v>

136
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>catharsis over a short window after </v>
<v Speaker 1>participant had been insulted,</v>

137
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.023
<v Speaker 1>which perhaps leaves open the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive behavior could be cathartic </v>

138
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 1>over the long term is longer.</v>

139
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.513
<v Speaker 1>Studies on aggression mostly focused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact of exposure to violence in </v>

140
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole nother episode.</v>

141
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>So if acting out your aggressive urges </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't relieve your emotional angst and</v>

142
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.983
<v Speaker 1>might even make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does psychology has a couple of </v>

143
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>suggestions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We strategies like deep breathing,</v>

144
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>relaxation and cognitive behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy at the top of the list.</v>

145
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Something called primal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Screaming has also been tested,</v>

146
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.793
<v Speaker 1>but the results were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconclusive and when it comes to </v>

147
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 1>deciding whether to avenge wrongdoing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it slide,</v>

148
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.613
<v Speaker 1>it seems that forgiving or forgetting </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be better ways to free your inner </v>

149
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.394
<v Speaker 1>demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 study led by Kevin Carl Smith of </v>

150
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:22.754
<v Speaker 1>colgate university gives evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have been wronged are less </v>

151
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.384
<v Speaker 1>likely to keep thinking about someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's offended them if they move on </v>

152
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:29.894
<v Speaker 1>without punishing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another group of researchers have </v>

153
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:33.434
<v Speaker 1>developed a theory that even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are hardwired to want to </v>

154
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:36.914
<v Speaker 1>retaliate against an aggressor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've evolved to forgive because it's </v>

155
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily advantageous.</v>

156
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting revenge against someone might </v>

157
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>make it less likely that they'll hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>you again.</v>

158
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.333
<v Speaker 1>We're telling iation also ruins the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to gain something from that </v>

159
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>person later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus according to their hypothesis,</v>

160
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness involved as a way for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have our cake and eat it too.</v>

161
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.033
<v Speaker 1>We get over the offense without losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance to benefit from the </v>

162
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>relationship later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that forgiveness is superior to</v>

163
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.010
<v Speaker 1>revenge is reflected in the purge </v>
<v Speaker 1>through all three of the films,</v>

164
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Mary Sand and chooses not to kill her </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick bag neighbors despite the fact that</v>

165
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>they almost hack her children to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

166
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>

167
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.443
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

168
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.520
<v Speaker 1>We're going to play the rest of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>night on.</v>

169
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Leo doesn't shoot the drunk driver who </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked free after killing his kid and </v>

170
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:24.324
<v Speaker 1>Senator Ron Alexa against often owens </v>
<v Speaker 1>after he attempts to have her </v>

171
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though doing so would not only have</v>

172
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:30.414
<v Speaker 1>served him right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also would have handed her the </v>

173
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>presidential election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she winds up winning anyway.</v>

174
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.393
<v Speaker 1>It appears that the NFFA supporters </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't quite get the memo about </v>

175
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:38.304
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness though as they're already </v>
<v Speaker 1>wreaking havoc at the end of the last </v>

176
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>film and that bet big supporters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting violently to this defeat.</v>

177
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They are burning cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does the purge work.</v>

178
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 1>There aren't any studies that let </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

179
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on a homicidal rage for a day,</v>

180
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.113
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to err on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>caution and saying and everyone purging </v>

181
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>by writing novels worth of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube comments.</v>

182
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

183
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.790
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad because in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this still limping.</v>

184
00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Strangers really does seem like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to blow off steam,</v>

185
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.433
<v Speaker 1>but let's talk about another theory like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if the earth suddenly </v>

186
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 1>stopped spinning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that would be bad,</v>

187
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but what would happen to the objects on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface when they fly off into space</v>

188
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:17.064
<v Speaker 1>along the straight line tangent to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface when they fly off along an </v>

189
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>initial tangent before setting into </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit,</v>

190
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.823
<v Speaker 1>would they fly along an initial tangent </v>
<v Speaker 1>before arking back to our humble planet </v>

191
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 1>or what they skid along earth's surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>following her sexy curves that you don't</v>

192
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 1>know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which she did want to prove me wrong</v>
