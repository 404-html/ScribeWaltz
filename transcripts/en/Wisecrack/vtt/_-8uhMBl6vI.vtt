1
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.450
<v Speaker 1>It's something of a cliche to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we live in a knowledge economy.</v>

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.733
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person's ability to command a high </v>

3
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>wage is going to depend upon having some</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills,</v>

4
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:17.614
<v Speaker 1>having skills that relate to perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology doesn't always have to be </v>

5
00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:22.534
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be some kind of value add </v>

6
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.253
<v Speaker 1>that you provide that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>command some pricing power in the labor </v>

7
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>how you do that is going to vary from </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry to industry.</v>

9
00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>In some cases it'll be doing things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers do well as a data analyst.</v>

10
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some cases it'll be doing things that</v>

11
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>computers can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human touch,</v>

12
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>professionals nursing and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.683
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to focus very hard </v>

14
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:52.264
<v Speaker 1>on those skills and the only way you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get those skills through learning and </v>

15
00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:57.634
<v Speaker 1>through continuous learning and any </v>
<v Speaker 1>company trying to hiring people will </v>

16
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:01.474
<v Speaker 1>recognize that probably the trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for most is not a </v>

17
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>particular set of skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the demonstrated ability to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills because any company will realize.</v>

19
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that what's crucial is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular set of skills you have,</v>

20
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.723
<v Speaker 1>but that you demonstrate a capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire them now because a few years </v>

21
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few months from now,</v>

22
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>it might turn out that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire new ones.</v>

23
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at software programmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

24
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.833
<v Speaker 1>any software programmer knows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>within two or three years for almost </v>

25
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:32.974
<v Speaker 1>everything they're doing right now will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be obsolete and they will have to learn </v>

26
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.394
<v Speaker 1>a whole new language as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on whether you're talking </v>

27
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>about mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're talking about apps,</v>

28
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:42.604
<v Speaker 1>whether you're talking about traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers and of course depending on </v>

29
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>what the particular configuration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardware and software you're using.</v>

30
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So all that keeps changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many worlds.</v>

32
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think that because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information revolution,</v>

33
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.393
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen even more so in </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds that we don't usually think of </v>

34
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:00.874
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Accreditation's in some way are the holy</v>
<v Speaker 1>grail of education.</v>

36
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.853
<v Speaker 1>The reason that American universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>are able to charge the extraordinary </v>

37
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:17.504
<v Speaker 1>price they charge a is because employers</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world believe that this is </v>

38
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.204
<v Speaker 1>the single best sorting mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to figure out whom to hire so </v>

39
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.334
<v Speaker 1>that if you have a undergraduate degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Harvard or war or University of </v>

40
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania's Wharton School,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.533
<v Speaker 1>a bank is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if it's in majoring in </v>

42
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bank is going to think of the 20,000</v>

43
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>applications we get for our entry 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

44
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.893
<v Speaker 1>These are some very good filters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at the people who went to </v>

45
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and wharton and Stanford and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

46
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>software programmers,</v>

47
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have gone to a good computer </v>

48
00:02:58.761 --> 00:02:59.594
<v Speaker 1>science program at a good university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume that's a very good way to </v>

49
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.184
<v Speaker 1>start to filter down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you probably go through </v>

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>interviews and things like that.</v>

51
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>What if somebody came to a technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>company or a bank and said,</v>

52
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.344
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the degree that you're </v>

53
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.324
<v Speaker 1>looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did take 25 courses online from </v>

54
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>these five online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a core of Moocs,</v>

55
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>many of which are Stanford courses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard courses and mit courses.</v>

56
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what I,</v>

57
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.033
<v Speaker 1>how I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here is a piece of paper that have </v>

58
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.183
<v Speaker 1>pieces of paper that prove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that demonstrate that I finished those </v>

59
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grades I got on them,</v>

60
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If employers start treating those pieces</v>

61
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those accreditation's as worth a lot.</v>

62
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>That completely changes the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>educatIon because then you are not,</v>

63
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are being paid for is really </v>

64
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:51.954
<v Speaker 1>more outcome related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is related to what skills have you </v>

65
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:55.564
<v Speaker 1>acquired rather than process-related did</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a four year bricks and mortar </v>

66
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>college and live in the dorms with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

67
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Some people may still value that ladder </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

68
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:05.404
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may still be worth worthwhile for </v>

69
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>some people to pay that because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>network effect because of the people you</v>

70
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>meet at a harvard or yale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could imagine that,</v>

71
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:15.664
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would not be true at universities </v>

72
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>one tear down or certainly two tiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

73
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in any case,</v>

74
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.443
<v Speaker 1>it would place huge pressure on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pricing model because all of a sudden </v>

75
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.830
<v Speaker 1>people are able to access many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills that,</v>

76
00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:31.664
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're being taught in a top </v>

77
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a fraction of the price.</v>

78
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.383
<v Speaker 1>so the key here is whether the employers</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to view accreditation as an </v>

79
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 1>outcome based process on skills as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to a,</v>

80
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

81
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a process in which it's very </v>

82
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 1>important that you have spent the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years at the college,</v>

83
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

84
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and acquired the full rounded education </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

85
00:04:57.141 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>that college provides.</v>
