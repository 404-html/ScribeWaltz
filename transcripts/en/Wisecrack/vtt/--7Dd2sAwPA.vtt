1
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>There is a rapid rise in the demand for </v>
<v Speaker 1>new skills.</v>

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that at the individual levels and</v>

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>we see this at aggregate levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a growing gap between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment and labor market prospects of</v>

5
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.324
<v Speaker 1>people who are highly skilled and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the lower end of the skill spectrum </v>

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.893
<v Speaker 1>skills determine more and more how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of economic growth I shat in </v>

7
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So success of companies today depends on</v>

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than on the talent pool </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they recruit.</v>

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.493
<v Speaker 1>70% of productivity gains have been bay </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically driven by improvements in the </v>

10
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.304
<v Speaker 1>skill base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a dramatically a rising </v>

11
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.514
<v Speaker 1>demand for better skilled people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the very same time we also see that </v>

12
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.714
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some countries there are many </v>

13
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:51.024
<v Speaker 1>graduates unemployed on the street while</v>
<v Speaker 1>employers say they cannot find the </v>

14
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.394
<v Speaker 1>people with the skills they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a emerging mismatch between </v>

15
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.864
<v Speaker 1>the kind of talent that is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed and the talent that is really </v>

16
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.894
<v Speaker 1>needed.</v>

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.733
<v Speaker 1>Tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that our data show us </v>

18
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.224
<v Speaker 1>that some of the scales that are easiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach and easiest to test are also </v>

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>the kind of skill set are easiest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>digitize,</v>

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>automate and outsource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.533
<v Speaker 1>That's a big challenge for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Education Industry today to </v>

22
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>what are they kind of 21st century </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills that will enable people.</v>

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.943
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past you could assume as a </v>

25
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>teacher you will teach someone for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what you learn in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to last for many,</v>

27
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today there's no longer the case today.</v>

28
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>We need to educate people for jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have not been created,</v>

29
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.134
<v Speaker 1>to use technologies that haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented to solve social and economic </v>

30
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>problems that we don't have any idea I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to arise.</v>

31
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.083
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge for education and that </v>

32
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>requires a very different caliber of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers,</v>

33
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>teachers who are not just reproducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of or educating the reproduction of</v>

34
00:01:58.861 --> 00:01:59.694
<v Speaker 1>subject matter content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it help young people to extrapolate </v>

35
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>from what they know to use and apply </v>
<v Speaker 1>their knowledge in novel situations.</v>

36
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>In a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world economy no longer pays you for</v>

37
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google knows everything.</v>

38
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
<v Speaker 1>The world economy piece you for what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with what you know in that </v>

39
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>requires a very different caliber of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers,</v>

40
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>a very different pedagogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>21st century Podagra be a very different</v>

41
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>relationship between teachers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

42
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.623
<v Speaker 1>Technology is part of this today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to explain why you should </v>

43
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:31.704
<v Speaker 1>accept the teacher next door if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have access to the world's best </v>

44
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.693
<v Speaker 1>knowledge anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing in an unbundling of </v>

45
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>educational content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational delivery,</v>

46
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and accreditation with people anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing on the world's best knowledge at</v>

47
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:46.734
<v Speaker 1>any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are seeing governments putting </v>

48
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>greater emphasis on evaluating outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on quality assurance,</v>

49
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>on setting standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the business sector actually being a</v>

50
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>lot more engaged in helping education </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

51
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:03:00.091 --> 00:03:00.924
<v Speaker 1>where his labor demand evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the kinds of skills that will </v>

53
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.204
<v Speaker 1>be there at a premium tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The business sector playing a very </v>

54
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>important role in as an education </v>
<v Speaker 1>provider,</v>

55
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>engaging actively in the design and </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery of instructional system,</v>

56
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>providing educational and learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for people in many,</v>

57
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.834
<v Speaker 1>many contexts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least we're seeing this in some </v>

58
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in others.</v>

59
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It's still a big challenge.</v>
