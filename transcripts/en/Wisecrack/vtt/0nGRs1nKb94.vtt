<v Speaker 1>Marshall goldsmith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>what got you here won't get you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote a story about this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard Business Online.</v>

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll give you a few tips on American</v>
<v Speaker 1>Airlines alone.</v>

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I have nine point 5 million frequent </v>
<v Speaker 1>flyer miles.</v>

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm the highest level flyer on united.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a gold card on British air,</v>

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:25.411
<v Speaker 1>Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yada,</v>

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like constantly.</v>

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Few tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number One,</v>

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>forget where you've been and be where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.053
<v Speaker 1>This is a Buddhist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst things you can do when </v>

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you travel is focus on what time is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Kentucky?</v>

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>What time is it where I started?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>You're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're here.</v>

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Another guideline is force yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep and I find it's very handy.</v>

16
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I wear the little things that put over </v>
<v Speaker 1>my eyes.</v>

17
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I put the blanket over my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep.</v>

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I sleep on airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

19
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>the other one I always use.</v>

20
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking on a long flight.</v>

21
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I was put the blanket over my head when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep.</v>

22
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>What it does is you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speak constantly as a for my job.</v>

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fly in an eight hour flight and </v>

24
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>you sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you breathe deeply,</v>

25
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>that dry air hits the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat and you get a sore throat.</v>

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.033
<v Speaker 1>If you put the blanket over your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it holds in your buddy moisture and you </v>

27
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>don't get a sore throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

28
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I found very few people talk to you when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the blanket over your head.</v>

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact sometimes two people sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to you leave.</v>

30
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>So you just put the blanket over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

32
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you sleep and then don't drink on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane.</v>

33
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>The only time I drank as if I'm on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hour flight,</v>

34
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to sleep.</v>

35
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I have one or two glasses of wine before</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to bed for a long period of time,</v>

36
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:43.344
<v Speaker 1>but in general don't drink on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane exercise when you get off the </v>

37
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.024
<v Speaker 1>plane if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is just make peace </v>

38
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.104
<v Speaker 1>with what is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I eat before I get on the </v>

39
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat on the plate.</v>

40
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.963
<v Speaker 1>If you get on the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three hours gets blown while </v>

41
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:00.564
<v Speaker 1>they're slowly bringing food back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and you have this sort of used </v>

42
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>plate sitting in front of you there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half hour,</v>

43
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the airport's.</v>

44
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody complains about flight number </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

45
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.193
<v Speaker 1>Almost always flown more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many days have I missed because of </v>

46
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.434
<v Speaker 1>flying in 30 years one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the system works better than people </v>

47
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 1>like to give it credit for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

48
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost always get to where I'm going.</v>

49
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the system actually works.</v>

50
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>People complain about the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat it,</v>

51
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>don't eat the food and always good make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't cost that much.</v>

52
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing that has gotten better</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the food at the airport,</v>

53
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The airport says 20 times better than it</v>

54
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew 30 years ago.</v>

55
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>The food was hideous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years ago.</v>

56
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>You had no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was overpriced.</v>

57
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Much better today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make the best of it.</v>

58
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is just your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>

59
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Be where you are and make peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to travel,</v>

60
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>don't travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to travel,</v>

61
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>don't whine about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

62
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:57.804
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I annoyed by very little </v>

63
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I do find it even annoys me is</v>

64
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:04.894
<v Speaker 1>people being rude to flight attendants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plane is like or yelling at the </v>

65
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.144
<v Speaker 1>flight attendant.</v>

66
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not the flight attendants fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't make the plane take off,</v>

67
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

68
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Just sit there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read a book,</v>

69
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>bring a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another good thing.</v>

70
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Brings something you want to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring a book,</v>

71
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>sit there and make peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

72
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to annoy everyone around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just shut up,</v>

73
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go with it and if you do that,</v>

74
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>it tends to work a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Africa.</v>

75
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps me in a very odd way.</v>

76
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.863
<v Speaker 1>In 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Africa with the American Red </v>

77
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.103
<v Speaker 1>Cross famine relief campaign and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched a lot of people starve to death </v>

78
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and I came home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I said,</v>

79
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>don't complain because the airplane's </v>
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

80
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>There are people out there starving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

81
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Don't complain because the airplanes </v>
<v Speaker 1>late every,</v>

82
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it sounds kind of trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time I get on an airplane,</v>

83
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:58.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

84
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>How serious is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not starving to death.</v>

85
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to die here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I wasting my life getting angry </v>

86
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>about this stuff you can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make peace with.</v>

87
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

88
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:16.414
<v Speaker 1>there's one way in my field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's helped a lot and I've got a good </v>

89
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>friend named cal wick has put together </v>
<v Speaker 1>this followup system.</v>

90
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what I do in coaching is </v>
<v Speaker 1>followup.</v>

91
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.993
<v Speaker 1>They've got some really great electronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>followup systems that people have </v>

92
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>developed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did you talk to?</v>

93
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>What did you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do about it?</v>

94
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Are these ongoing sense of reminders and</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow up and it works really,</v>

95
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>really well if people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

96
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a really positive use of technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help people get better.</v>

97
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I think new technology is part of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the keys for being the leader</v>

99
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:52.844
<v Speaker 1>of the future is technological savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of what I learned is it goes back </v>

100
00:04:55.401 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 1>to basic Buddhist philosophy of accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the past is the past.</v>

101
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>We can all have these little nostalgic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lonnie longings for the past,</v>

102
00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone now.</v>

103
00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I have a 61 corvette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a beautiful car,</v>

104
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.980
<v Speaker 1>just beautiful white with a red coat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>very spiffy looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody talks about how great the cars</v>

106
00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 1>were in the past though they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were awful.</v>

107
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 1>They broke down all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their breaks were terrible.</v>

108
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You can buy a $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>car today.</v>

109
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's far better than any car you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have bought the past.</v>

110
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.280
<v Speaker 1>We just have these memories about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past as if it were this wonderful time.</v>

111
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past people forget.</v>

112
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.703
<v Speaker 1>We used to have things like racism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexism and we had a lot of things in a </v>

113
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.364
<v Speaker 1>password.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so wonderful that today they are </v>

114
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.144
<v Speaker 1>much better now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of things are much better </v>

115
00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:39.614
<v Speaker 1>than they used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the main thing is make peace </v>

116
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:44.810
<v Speaker 1>with what is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you are where you are.</v>

117
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.360
<v Speaker 1>So you're here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we have lots of technology,</v>

118
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>so make peace with lots of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

119
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:52.154
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not an acceptable option is to </v>

120
00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:53.991
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff is part of life.</v>

122
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fast past.</v>

123
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I was part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make peace.</v>

124
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

125
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.044
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn how to use </v>

126
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>technology or else you're just lost.</v>
