1
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I think right now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways they're making our lives</v>

2
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>better is they make people think right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things.</v>

3
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Video Games are good at you in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the game.</v>

4
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>You can't just sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think,</v>

5
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to think and engage and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.773
<v Speaker 1>And I think right now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk now to the people who are </v>

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.334
<v Speaker 1>at the forefront of educational reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them are talking about how do we </v>

8
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>use these games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see how powerful they are.</v>

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>They're all picking them up like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of sword and trying to charge in to</v>

10
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to use this to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>education better.</v>

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.843
<v Speaker 1>I think in terms of improving ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the areas we're </v>

12
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.744
<v Speaker 1>going to see at the forefront,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're going to be many </v>

13
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>other areas as well.</v>

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've already seen the success of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like the we fit,</v>

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.121
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>an exercise platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the weekend.</v>

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.673
<v Speaker 1>It's been incredibly popular in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sticking with it and it really </v>

19
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>changing their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure,</v>

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they've already made I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think $2,000,000,000</v>

21
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>selling those things speaks to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is something people want you,</v>

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk to wealthy people who have a </v>

23
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>personal trainer and they talk about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective it is.</v>

24
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.514
<v Speaker 1>This person comes in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to do this and you need to do </v>

25
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>that and there's a social pressure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order for you to kind of do this and not</v>

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.264
<v Speaker 1>let the trainer down and trainers know </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of psychological tricks in </v>

27
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>order to kind of put you right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right level.</v>

28
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:30.414
<v Speaker 1>You need to be.</v>

29
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Everyone will be able to have that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of personal trainer.</v>

30
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not only just for the physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical things and exercise,</v>

31
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>but for their education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their hobbies,</v>

32
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>for their art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their spirituality,</v>

33
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>for anything in their life that they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to improve.</v>

34
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:52.341
<v Speaker 1>That is certainly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there are people who,</v>

35
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play video games in a way that makes </v>

36
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:57.414
<v Speaker 1>their life out of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually these are people who have some </v>

37
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>significant gap in their life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

38
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>they're filling it with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way that is isn't healthy.</v>

39
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people say,</v>

40
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you occasionally hear people make this </v>

41
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>accusation that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way there's these problems with </v>

43
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>video game addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ruining people's lives.</v>

44
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.063
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is these video game </v>
<v Speaker 1>designers try and make the games too </v>

45
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:23.514
<v Speaker 1>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They designed the games to be addictive </v>

46
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>and if they would just stop doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem would go away.</v>

47
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>But this is like saying that obesity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fault of the bakers.</v>

48
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.653
<v Speaker 1>We're making the cakes too delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if only you would make the cakes a </v>

49
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.434
<v Speaker 1>little less tasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be this whole obesity </v>

50
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>problem would go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>That's not where the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem lies.</v>

52
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.724
<v Speaker 1>The problem lies with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how to take these </v>

53
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>entertainment experiences and integrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a healthy way,</v>

54
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incident their lives,</v>

55
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

56
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>as predominant as these entertainments </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in our lives.</v>

57
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>The problem does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a problem for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

59
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be an epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

60
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely a problem for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and it's certainly worthy of sort</v>

61
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>of study and understanding about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>best manage it.</v>
