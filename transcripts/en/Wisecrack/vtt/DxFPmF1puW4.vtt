00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.960
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>skillshare.</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared again.</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most nuanced takes on geek culture out </v>

4
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang theory.</v>

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad.</v>

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Like really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

8
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>it's become somewhat of a recurring gag </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to hate on this show,</v>

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>so when you sadistic maniacs asked for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong,</v>

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>we reached out to one of our unfortunate</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

11
00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:30.274
<v Speaker 1>Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of making this poor bastard </v>

12
00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>watch all 5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>175 minutes of this show,</v>

13
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 1>we just hopped on imdv and grabbed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top 10 rated episodes.</v>

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.833
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot afford to pay this man's </v>

15
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I digress.</v>

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.583
<v Speaker 1>Why is a show that deals with science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics and all that good wise crack </v>

17
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>stuff so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>after hours of grueling research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we suspect it might have something to do</v>

19
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>with references,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's subtle.</v>

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.033
<v Speaker 1>The fate of doctor who's Tardis will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided by a game of thrones inspired </v>

21
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>death match on the battlefield of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thunder cats versus transformers.</v>

22
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big Bang theory isn't just bad.</v>

23
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.223
<v Speaker 1>It's profoundly bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad that it requires philosophy </v>

24
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:12.544
<v Speaker 1>to understand just how bad it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so join me as I attempt to convince you </v>

25
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>that the Big Bang theory is proof that </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is dead,</v>

26
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>woken Louis wise crack addition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Bang theory,</v>

27
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong and big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to the real MVP,</v>

28
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:26.884
<v Speaker 1>Thomas for watching this garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang theory loves </v>

29
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:30.334
<v Speaker 1>referentiality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They referenced cornerstones of nerd </v>

30
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:37.201
<v Speaker 1>culture like star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheldon's log three,</v>

31
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:38.654
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five point three for Battlestar </v>

32
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Galactica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my original series,</v>

33
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:42.764
<v Speaker 1>battlestar Galactica flight suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even scientific facts and </v>

34
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>mathematical formulas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're slipped in to remind us over and</v>

35
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>over again that Leonard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheldon,</v>

36
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>and company are diehard nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They buy comics,</v>

37
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.024
<v Speaker 1>perform science experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes described very basic </v>

38
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>things like slipping in a bathtub like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

39
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.343
<v Speaker 1>Not Surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no safety math or adhesive </v>

40
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>stickers to allow for purchase on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface with a low coefficient of static</v>

41
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:08.464
<v Speaker 1>friction.</v>

42
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case you missed the laugh track,</v>

43
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>sheldon giving penny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition of friction was the joke.</v>

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because it's a reference now.</v>

45
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're wondering why you feel a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheated at the punchline here,</v>

46
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it's probably because that definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>friction was simply slotted in there and</v>

47
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.323
<v Speaker 1>the other scientific statement about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality feels like it could </v>

48
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>have had the same effect here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like gravity for instance,</v>

49
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>and cue the next job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to the emergency room.</v>

50
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say when you're correct,</v>

51
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 1>did you write humorous is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>seated in the glenoid socket?</v>

52
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.223
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have replaced the word </v>

53
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:42.714
<v Speaker 1>humorous and glenoid socket with </v>
<v Speaker 1>jibberish and most wouldn't know the </v>

54
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>difference and that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual science isn't the job,</v>

55
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>science is friction isn't funny.</v>

56
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.763
<v Speaker 1>V referenced to friction is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By contrast considered this brief </v>

57
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>futurama reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For somebody who barely understands math</v>

58
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.034
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reference will probably evade </v>

59
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.283
<v Speaker 1>detection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for those who spot the symbol for </v>

60
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>all if know the mathematical symbol for </v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite sense of countable numbers,</v>

61
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll realize that theater is implying</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of screens.</v>

62
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>This not only gives an Easter egg for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mathematically inclined,</v>

63
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.394
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke is the impossibilities of a </v>

64
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>movie theater having infinite screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joke is about the subject of all,</v>

65
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>if no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the mere reference to it.</v>

66
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>The reference imbues the joke with </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional meaning,</v>

67
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>whereas the Big Bang theory accomplishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite.</v>

68
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Leonard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you recall what I said?</v>

69
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.263
<v Speaker 1>I was going to revolutionize humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the Higgs Boson </v>

70
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>particle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said,</v>

71
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>sheldon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 2:00</v>

72
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.993
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get Out of my bedroom.</v>

73
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>These jokes are at best lazy writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at worst,</v>

74
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.380
<v Speaker 1>a small step toward the complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilation of reality.</v>

75
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might sound extreme,</v>

76
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:54.564
<v Speaker 1>but these kinds of references with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject is exactly what kept French </v>

77
00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 1>philosopher John Beaudry yard up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night to Baudrillard.</v>

78
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 1>We're living in a state where reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

79
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.133
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biliterate.</v>

80
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.520
<v Speaker 1>He gives four levels of representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first level is like a picture,</v>

81
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.160
<v Speaker 1>a perfectly accurate representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

82
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>The second level of representation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unfaithful copy.</v>

83
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>A filter that makes you look prettier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus obscuring your actual face.</v>

84
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.463
<v Speaker 1>Below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the third level of </v>

85
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that deliberately hide the fact that</v>

86
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:26.730
<v Speaker 1>there's no reality being represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an artist's rendering of you,</v>

87
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>where they've never actually seen you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally the fourth level is reserved</v>

88
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.583
<v Speaker 1>for when signs and representations start</v>
<v Speaker 1>referencing other signs and </v>

89
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>representations and all sense of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is thrown out the window.</v>

90
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.603
<v Speaker 1>This is when people start photoshopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>a photoshop image or making memes of </v>

91
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:44.064
<v Speaker 1>other memes in butchery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art's eyes were already living in a </v>

92
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:47.034
<v Speaker 1>world controlled by a system of fourth </v>
<v Speaker 1>order Simulacra or any reference to the </v>

93
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:51.624
<v Speaker 1>original reality is lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might explain why he technically </v>

94
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:57.660
<v Speaker 1>considers our reality a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

95
00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:58.494
<v Speaker 1>if we're being optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big Bang theory is a distorted view </v>

96
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>of real nerd culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second order of representation,</v>

97
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 1>it gets a lot of the details wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still about real nerd culture,</v>

98
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>but if we're being pessimistic and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

99
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a show about nerd culture that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>no relation to reality whatsoever.</v>

100
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Beathard order of representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a copy of something that never existed.</v>

101
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.620
<v Speaker 1>It has science without actual science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about nerd culture.</v>

102
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Without real nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more like,</v>

103
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who has never met an nerd thinks</v>

104
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:30.654
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the bad science references </v>

105
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>become relevant to beaudry art more </v>
<v Speaker 1>often than not.</v>

106
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.993
<v Speaker 1>Jokes rely on characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cramming in whatever scientific </v>

107
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>explanation is relevant to the action </v>
<v Speaker 1>when our roadways most slippery now.</v>

108
00:05:42.771 --> 00:05:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three answers,</v>

109
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.843
<v Speaker 1>none of which are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correct answer is when covered by a </v>

110
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.054
<v Speaker 1>film of liquid sufficient to reduce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coefficient of static friction between </v>

111
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the tire and the road to essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

112
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but not so deep as to introduce a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of friction</v>

113
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.623
<v Speaker 1>references for the sake of references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jokes that don't rely on any </v>

114
00:06:01.991 --> 00:06:05.710
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather these simple recognition that</v>

115
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:06.544
<v Speaker 1>this is a scientific reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference between sheldon </v>

116
00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:11.380
<v Speaker 1>explaining how locks work when pennies </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked out.</v>

117
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Damn key out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising that Baldwin lock on</v>

118
00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>your door uses traditional edge mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>cylinders.</v>

119
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the key for your Volkswagen uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>a center cylinder system</v>

120
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.790
<v Speaker 1>and when Leila and the professor are </v>
<v Speaker 1>racing and drama,</v>

121
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a lap,</v>

122
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.283
<v Speaker 1>you forgotten the mobius strip to lapse </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one lap your kids and your topology </v>

123
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.613
<v Speaker 1>in the former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joke doesn't rely on an audience </v>

124
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.224
<v Speaker 1>understanding how locks actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is irrelevant as long as we </v>

125
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 1>recognize that sheldon is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily smart.</v>

126
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.023
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in future trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're laughing at the actual science </v>

127
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 1>referenced in the joke for Beaudry art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As things progress,</v>

128
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>these copies of reality end up becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own reality,</v>

129
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.223
<v Speaker 1>and this is where we see boatyards </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismal vision reflected in the Big Bang </v>

130
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:01.664
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These copies divorced from reality </v>

131
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>either partly or entirely signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only the death of meaning,</v>

132
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.353
<v Speaker 1>but make all ideas interchangeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the jokes in the show are </v>

133
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:12.944
<v Speaker 1>apropos of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The characters can essentially spew </v>

134
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>meaningless nonsense under the guise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful job like in the shows game,</v>

135
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.204
<v Speaker 1>mystic warlords of Qa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which starts as a kind of joke about </v>

136
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gathering in visibility,</v>

137
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>spelled luminescent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spell,</v>

138
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>and then quickly descends into utter </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense to headed tigers.</v>

139
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Three-Headed lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sulfur brimstone.</v>

140
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if they said two </v>
<v Speaker 1>headed tiger,</v>

141
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>three-headed lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven headed ethical Logan,</v>

142
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:41.264
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Frankfurt school jamming crusted </v>

143
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.154
<v Speaker 1>Beagle Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joke will work on the audience no </v>

144
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>matter what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the show functions at a level of</v>

145
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>selling you an empty joke under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guise of a meaningful one.</v>

146
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.993
<v Speaker 1>So here's the big question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if the Big Bang theory's use of </v>

147
00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>reference for reference's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately points at nothing,</v>

148
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.393
<v Speaker 1>then what are we laughing at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hair is growing at the rate of four </v>

149
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>point six meters per femtosecond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Or at least what is the studio audience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laughing gas.</v>

152
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>It is scientifically impossible for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to typical.</v>

153
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.723
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody please tell me her new sounded </v>

154
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:18.484
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're forgetting is it was an </v>

155
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>achievement in the field of biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all about Yucky squishy thing.</v>

156
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after conducting a rigorous study,</v>

157
00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:33.240
<v Speaker 1>our team of media experts has come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an answer.</v>

158
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.460
<v Speaker 1>The show basically just it's on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

159
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:36.420
<v Speaker 1>That's all that's happening.</v>

160
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.253
<v Speaker 3>Princeton fine institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll place where Albert Einstein </v>

161
00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:46.530
<v Speaker 3>taught and where Leonard got his phd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it may have gone downhill</v>

162
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.140
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

163
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.720
<v Speaker 1>when Leonard and Raj think about buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard a prostitute,</v>

164
00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:55.150
<v Speaker 1>following your recent breakup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's exactly a stipe a WHO,</v>

165
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>if we hired her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would cheer him up.</v>

166
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.290
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get Wolowitz a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooker.</v>

167
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm so lonely and Horny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and </v>

168
00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:13.934
<v Speaker 1>ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

169
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Or like when sheldon defenses girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stewart's kind of interested in amy.</v>

170
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course she is.</v>

171
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.320
<v Speaker 1>She's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know when she was 14?</v>

172
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.590
<v Speaker 1>She suffered the webbing between her own</v>
<v Speaker 1>toes.</v>

173
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:32.643
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping on people is actually how the </v>

174
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:35.164
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of humor started in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest theory of humor is the </v>

175
00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:42.580
<v Speaker 1>superiority theory which began with </v>
<v Speaker 1>plato saying that laughter was a form of</v>

176
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:46.480
<v Speaker 1>scorn that people we laugh at are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally unaware of how awful they are,</v>

177
00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:48.760
<v Speaker 1>which invites our laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later on,</v>

178
00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:49.594
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Hobbes modified this a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying that laughter was a result of </v>

179
00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:54.490
<v Speaker 1>our competitive nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we laugh,</v>

180
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it's either because we're triumphing </v>
<v Speaker 1>over another or watching their downfall.</v>

181
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even take heart,</v>

182
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>waded into the discussion calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughter.</v>

183
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.620
<v Speaker 1>The result of scorn which proceeds from </v>
<v Speaker 1>are perceiving a small eval and a person</v>

184
00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:08.380
<v Speaker 1>whom we consider to be deserving of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

185
00:10:08.381 --> 00:10:10.660
<v Speaker 1>all three philosophers agree that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we laugh,</v>

186
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it's at the expense of others to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves feel good.</v>

187
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>While this might seem pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big Bang theory isn't Seinfeld.</v>

188
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>These aren't horrible people deserving </v>
<v Speaker 1>our scorn.</v>

189
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Case in point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show runner,</v>

190
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>chuck lorre literally said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show is not about cakes or nerds,</v>

191
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>but about extraordinary people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if they're so extraordinary,</v>

192
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:31.974
<v Speaker 1>why do they deserve to be done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which brings us to the big picture </v>

193
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of building up nerd culture,</v>

194
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.213
<v Speaker 1>the big bang theory kind of tears it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down when the show simply pays lip </v>

195
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>service to nerdom mechanically inserting</v>
<v Speaker 1>any reference.</v>

196
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:45.444
<v Speaker 1>For reference's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show reveals its contempt for real </v>

197
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.044
<v Speaker 1>nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The details of nerd culture are </v>

198
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:53.540
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant as long as they sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>winky assholes.</v>

199
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.383
<v Speaker 1>It's close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm attempting to view my work as a </v>

200
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>fleeting peripheral image to engage the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior Colliculus of my brain,</v>

201
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.400
<v Speaker 1>and while the show can fall back on it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>

202
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.243
<v Speaker 1>track or rip its characters long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has he been stuck actually about 30 </v>

203
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:13.190
<v Speaker 1>hours emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 29 years.</v>

204
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

205
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.130
<v Speaker 1>this does all of us nerds from the buffy</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>

206
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:18.964
<v Speaker 1>So the marvel fans a disservice instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of finding ourselves reflected on </v>

207
00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:23.404
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see characters that kind of just get </v>

208
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.430
<v Speaker 1>dumped on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think?</v>

209
00:11:27.431 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Wise crack or we being too harsh on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest show in the world,</v>

210
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.100
<v Speaker 1>or are we being a bunch of jealous </v>
<v Speaker 1>haters,</v>

211
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
