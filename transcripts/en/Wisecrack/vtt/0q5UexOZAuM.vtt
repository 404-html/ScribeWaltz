1
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.013
<v Speaker 1>Often had the experience of teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we heard someone calling our name and </v>

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>then realizing that wasn't really the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case and we just,</v>

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>we move on and we forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we notice coincidence like,</v>

4
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.973
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple of cars on the </v>

5
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

6
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>we pay no attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for someone with schizophrenia,</v>

7
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>these experiences take on a vastly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>A kind of a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might notice,</v>

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.493
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were three red cars on the street </v>

10
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and instead of just forgetting about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking,</v>

11
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:36.424
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were there three red cars on the </v>

12
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>street?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe has something to do with me?</v>

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.233
<v Speaker 1>Maybe these people are actually coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>to to monitor me or do something that </v>

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.803
<v Speaker 1>would harm me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start working through some kind </v>

15
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>of plot or conspiracy related to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidence that you noticed</v>

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>symptoms that people are most familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and schizophrenia are often hearing</v>

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>voices or having paranoid delusions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid thoughts.</v>

18
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>And we now know that in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of symptoms,</v>

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>many people with schizophrenia have have</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble focusing,</v>

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>paying attention and remembering things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people you know,</v>

21
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>talk about hearing voices and mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

22
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

23
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.324
<v Speaker 1>when I'm thinking about what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear a voice in my head that tells me </v>

24
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>this would be the right thing to do or </v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be the wrong thing to do,</v>

25
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:21.924
<v Speaker 1>or or that gives me an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when individuals with schizophrenia </v>

26
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>talk about hearing voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they describe it very,</v>

27
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>very differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a voice that they can't tell</v>

28
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>the difference between that voice and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice coming from a person sitting right</v>

29
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>next to them in a room and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely real.</v>

30
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.383
<v Speaker 1>It sounds loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's so loud that they can't </v>

31
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:43.254
<v Speaker 1>stop paying attention to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the voices are just calling </v>

32
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the voices are saying much</v>

33
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>more complicated things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're giving them commands,</v>

34
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:52.734
<v Speaker 1>telling them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're commenting on what </v>

35
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>they're doing often in a negative or </v>
<v Speaker 1>derogatory way.</v>

36
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>It comes as no surprise that the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a complicated place.</v>

37
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.443
<v Speaker 1>There's information flying all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and the brain has to get that </v>

38
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:09.704
<v Speaker 1>information to the right place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what to do with it and we think </v>

39
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:13.244
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps in schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the problems come because </v>

40
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>information isn't getting to the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>place or sometimes when information does</v>

41
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:20.864
<v Speaker 1>get to the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain doesn't know what it should </v>

42
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to and what it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore.</v>

43
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>This is really important in our everyday</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

44
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might hear a car alarm in the </v>

45
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>background and we have to know not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to that,</v>

46
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.083
<v Speaker 1>but we might also hear a baby crying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the background and that probably is </v>

47
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>something that we need to pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

48
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.703
<v Speaker 1>And so if your brain's not able to act </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an executive and say this is what's </v>

49
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:41.954
<v Speaker 1>important and what's not important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes very difficult to sort </v>

50
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>through those everyday situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.833
<v Speaker 1>in ways that are really important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>living and holding down a job or </v>

52
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 1>managing your life.</v>

53
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Seeing things visual hallucinations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more uncommon.</v>

54
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.243
<v Speaker 1>Schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do sometimes happen and sometimes </v>

55
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 1>they take the form of people seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghosts or seeing people who aren't </v>

56
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.084
<v Speaker 1>really in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they look at a picture and </v>

57
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:10.924
<v Speaker 1>they see something more than what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture shows a often something with </v>

58
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>nefarious intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.504
<v Speaker 1>those are the kinds of experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals with schizophrenia will </v>

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>describe some people have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people don't,</v>

62
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>even for people who have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can come and go at times,</v>

63
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these other symptoms that we now </v>

64
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>understand better and are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize more,</v>

65
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.523
<v Speaker 1>they're much more fundamental to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and they're much harder to deal </v>

66
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.320
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

67
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and those are the symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having trouble paying attention,</v>

68
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.903
<v Speaker 1>having trouble remembering information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having trouble being able to </v>

69
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>organize your activities and switch from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one activity to another activity.</v>

70
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.793
<v Speaker 1>These are things which individuals with </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia start to find are harder </v>

71
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 1>than they were before they became ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden they,</v>

72
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>they have trouble paying attention in </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

73
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>They have trouble focusing on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're reading.</v>

74
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>They have trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.243
<v Speaker 1>doing jobs that require them to switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>between one kind of thing and another </v>

76
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:04.774
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing quickly and that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously stands in the way of people </v>

77
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>live their lives to the fullest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to work,</v>

79
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:11.944
<v Speaker 1>being able to manage their household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to manage their families and </v>

80
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>family relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those symptoms,</v>

81
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>what we often call cognitive symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms related to attention and memory</v>

82
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:21.244
<v Speaker 1>and concentration and focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really one of our biggest </v>

83
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>challenges right now in schizophrenia.</v>
