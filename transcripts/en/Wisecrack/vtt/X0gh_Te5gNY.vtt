00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

3
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Garrick's were amyloid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is Black Swan,</v>

4
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>directed by Darwin Aronofsky and Storing</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natalie Portman Holloway.</v>

5
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.523
<v Speaker 1>The film follows Nina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human ballerina who wants to play </v>

6
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.764
<v Speaker 1>center on the Swan Lakers at tryouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coach tells her she's technically a </v>

7
00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:36.964
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not bubble a common problem among </v>

8
00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>dancers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she takes matters into our own hands,</v>

9
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>matters being the coach's face and books</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gig by biting her bosses lip,</v>

10
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't always work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it does,</v>

11
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.003
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After receiving a sincere </v>

12
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:54.064
<v Speaker 1>congratulations from the old guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you suck his Nina is told to watch </v>

13
00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>lily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another human woman who's got the thorax</v>

14
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:01.954
<v Speaker 1>of a crab Devlin and the voice of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>angel fearing she'll always be a birds </v>

15
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>made and never a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina gets back knee and stress feathers.</v>

16
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.943
<v Speaker 1>Lily takes Nina out for a night of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational drugs because that's what </v>

17
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>friends do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karen,</v>

18
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>they wind up sharing the dance floor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a vagina.</v>

19
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.763
<v Speaker 1>The next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina shows up late to work and in a </v>

20
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Pepsi twist realizes the lesbos sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen.</v>

21
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Although how did she get home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Screw it.</v>

22
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.513
<v Speaker 1>Like Disney's Mulan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina starts wondering when her </v>

23
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>reflection will show who she is inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dishonors her family.</v>

24
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.953
<v Speaker 1>The big game finally comes and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>before halftime she gets dropped like a </v>

25
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 1>phone call on a t and t I've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked libby along with all carriers,</v>

26
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:49.744
<v Speaker 1>when the moon exploded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lilly decides to put the team on her </v>

27
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nina has other ideas,</v>

28
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>namely stabbing her so she can spin </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

29
00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of crowd goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

30
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>The coach goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meow,</v>

31
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and lily goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

32
00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:01.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out Nina's only hallucinated </v>

33
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:05.284
<v Speaker 1>killing Lilli just like she's been doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn movie a consummate </v>

34
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:09.820
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

35
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 1>she wins the game with just enough time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to die on a mattress.</v>

36
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Black Swan contemplates the quest for </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection and the cost of excellence </v>

37
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>because you think I wake up like this.</v>

38
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.293
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film is reminiscent of the 1948 </v>

39
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red shoes,</v>

40
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.763
<v Speaker 1>which similarly depicts a ballerina </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's drive to succeed ultimately leads </v>

41
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:30.904
<v Speaker 1>to an early retirement in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reminds us that beneath a Ballerina's </v>

42
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>veneer of perfect poison control is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>life of struggle and physical therapy.</v>

43
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>This idea is encapsulated in Nina's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballet Doodad.</v>

44
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.620
<v Speaker 1>It arrives in pristine condition from </v>
<v Speaker 1>reebok,</v>

45
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.633
<v Speaker 1>but Nina immediately rips it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstructs it in her own vision of </v>

46
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>perfection because it's her way or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intergalactic travel warped way.</v>

47
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>The film plays loosely on the themes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ballet.</v>

48
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 1>At the heart of the film next to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs.</v>

49
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.593
<v Speaker 1>Swan Lakers tells the of Odette and </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent girl transformed into a </v>

50
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.824
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian Swan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina's journey reflects the ballets </v>

51
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
<v Speaker 1>themes of duality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The use of mirrors throughout the film </v>

52
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>focuses the viewer on Nina's exploration</v>
<v Speaker 1>of who she is and that back thing.</v>

53
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>She should really get checked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

54
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>lily actively functions as a reflection </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Nina,</v>

55
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>albeit a more sexually liberated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool girl who just gets it.</v>

56
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the wishing impersonalized </v>

57
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>effortless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

58
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>black and white imagery demonstrates the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrasting psyches of Nina,</v>

59
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>like the Chinese philosophy of the Ying </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yang twins.</v>

60
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.073
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina can only don the white swan tights </v>

61
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.673
<v Speaker 1>since she hasn't learned how to unlock </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark side of her personality and </v>

62
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>it's before Labor Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I look at you,</v>

63
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>all I see is the White Swan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This reflects Carl Young,</v>

64
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:49.114
<v Speaker 1>owns observation on the shadow writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone carries a shadow and the less </v>

65
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>it is embodied in the individual's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious life,</v>

66
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.283
<v Speaker 1>the blacker and denser it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since Nina's shadow has been repressed </v>

67
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>all her life when it finally comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sinister and powerful,</v>

68
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.113
<v Speaker 1>but also fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina's struggled to reel in her </v>

69
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:07.954
<v Speaker 1>previously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Untapped consciousness symbolizes the </v>

70
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>transition from children into grownups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven.</v>

71
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina's mama bear traps are in a state of</v>

72
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notably,</v>

73
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.841
<v Speaker 1>Nina is likely a play on the word Nina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means little girl in Espaniol,</v>

74
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.983
<v Speaker 1>which means Spanish in German or bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an ad for hello kitty and her mother </v>

75
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>tucked her into bed every night when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not breaking legs.</v>

76
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queen Beth,</v>

77
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.513
<v Speaker 1>the old dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed out of the company and in front </v>

78
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>of a bus signifies a glimpse into </v>
<v Speaker 1>womanhood.</v>

79
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>When Nina steals or clown makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's expressing a childlike curiosity.</v>

80
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It isn't until Nina experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual awakening,</v>

81
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>if a little molested that she develops </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a human woman.</v>

82
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.533
<v Speaker 1>Gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nina's wardrobe changes from white to </v>

83
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:55.354
<v Speaker 1>gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reverse gandalf and finally to black </v>

84
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>signifying her loss of innocence because</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you go black,</v>

85
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.823
<v Speaker 1>you never go back to uninspired.</v>
