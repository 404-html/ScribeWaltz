00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.780
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackwoods.</v>

2
00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Stick around till the end of the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a preview.</v>

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>as I briefly alluded to in our last </v>
<v Speaker 1>south park video,</v>

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I've been playing a lot of red dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemption two lately and at the risk of</v>

6
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:19.234
<v Speaker 1>sounding hyperbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing less than a milestone in </v>

7
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>the art of gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

8
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I could spend the entirety of this video</v>
<v Speaker 1>geeking out about the detail,</v>

9
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>the story of the performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I want to talk about</v>

10
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>today because surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about philosophy.</v>

11
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.343
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one mission in the game that </v>

12
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:37.354
<v Speaker 1>builds its entire trajectory around too </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical ideas and not only is it </v>

13
00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:42.604
<v Speaker 1>quite clever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it builds off the critique of early </v>

14
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>American values that the franchise is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous for versus America.</v>

15
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.703
<v Speaker 1>You can always cut a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this test Vlog format on </v>

16
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:54.904
<v Speaker 1>red dead redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two we might do a bigger wisecrack </v>

17
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>condition that focuses on the entirety </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the game,</v>

18
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't even finished it yet.</v>

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.863
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys like hearing about our </v>

20
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:03.754
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so consider this a little window into </v>

21
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>how we think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you think about it.</v>

22
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>This new format in the comments and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>insignificant spoilers ahead.</v>

23
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't matter.</v>

24
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.403
<v Speaker 1>Starting early in chapter four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go on a three part stranger </v>

25
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>mission called idealism and pragmatism </v>
<v Speaker 1>for beginners.</v>

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.033
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably see why we're breaking </v>

27
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:23.134
<v Speaker 1>down this mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comically explores the basic tenants </v>

28
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:26.404
<v Speaker 1>of idealism and pragmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in its exploration of </v>

29
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:29.884
<v Speaker 1>pragmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a uniquely American philosophy that we </v>

30
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:33.214
<v Speaker 1>get to see that classic rock star </v>
<v Speaker 1>sarcasm as they take American values </v>

31
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.743
<v Speaker 1>down a peg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first part of the mission we're </v>

32
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.264
<v Speaker 1>introduced to mayor Lemieux,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pragmatist and his assistant John </v>

33
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.893
<v Speaker 1>mark the idealist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Mayor Informs Arthur that he </v>

34
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>recently bought a collection of classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>paintings to hang in a new museum.</v>

35
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>He plans to open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but turns out he's been conned.</v>

36
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 1>The sleazy art dealer painted them </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

37
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's no biggie for Limu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem solver who will display them</v>

38
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are good paintings.</v>

39
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't make the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm French,</v>

40
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.703
<v Speaker 1>but an expert by the name of professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift occur is on his way to evaluate </v>

41
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the paintings and make public their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraudulence.</v>

42
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>So Mayor Lemieux Hires Arthur to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidate professor shift occur so that</v>

43
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:16.804
<v Speaker 1>he changes his professional opinion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deems the paintings real shift occur </v>

44
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>initially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resist.</v>

45
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Bud Arthur's fist are quite convincing.</v>

46
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does this have to do with either</v>

47
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.123
<v Speaker 1>in this part of the mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we most clearly see an interesting </v>

49
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:36.094
<v Speaker 1>exploration of pragmatism originating in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1870s pregnant tism isn't American </v>

50
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>philosophy primarily developed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Pierce?</v>

51
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>William James and John Dewey pragmatists</v>
<v Speaker 1>vary in their specific philosophies,</v>

52
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:48.694
<v Speaker 1>but one tendency among them all is their</v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to settle metaphysical and </v>

53
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 1>scientific debates according to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical consequences of ideas.</v>

54
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>So basically they emphasize that which </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful to advance human understanding of</v>

55
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>

56
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.514
<v Speaker 1>this stands in contrast with those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>sought out universal truths with reason </v>

57
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>allowed German idealists like a manual </v>
<v Speaker 1>con.</v>

58
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So on the one level we see the mayor </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever the pragmatist deciding to beat the</v>

59
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>shit out of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long as it's useful.</v>

60
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And John Mark the idealist holding moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles as universal truths,</v>

61
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>not unlike our boy caught fire nuts is </v>
<v Speaker 1>never right.</v>

62
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.193
<v Speaker 1>But there's another reading of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario that perhaps incidentally </v>

63
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>comments on how pragmatism deals with </v>
<v Speaker 1>our understanding of reality.</v>

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Pragmatists don't look towards universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>truths and stress that human ideas about</v>

65
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>reality are likely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because humans are fallible,</v>

66
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.323
<v Speaker 1>some pragmatic thinkers favor ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most useful for a pragmatist </v>

67
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.154
<v Speaker 1>like John Dewey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientific hypotheses are great because </v>

68
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>they're useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if they're not 100% right,</v>

69
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>we can fumble around with them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire more scientific knowledge,</v>

70
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>which allows us to concoct better </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

71
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>The same for dewey should be true of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical ideas.</v>

72
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Rather than search for some capital t </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

73
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.113
<v Speaker 1>one should instead search for an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be useful to humanity and its </v>

74
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:10.954
<v Speaker 1>advancement of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we see another layer to the </v>

75
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:14.434
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mayor hires Arthur to beat the shit </v>

76
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>out of a guy until he admits that a fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting is real.</v>

77
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.523
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although this isn't exactly what the </v>

78
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>pragmatist we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making a blunt if reductive joke</v>

79
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>about pragmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

80
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:28.084
<v Speaker 1>The paintings aren't real per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that they are real has its </v>

81
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>use in the advancement of public </v>
<v Speaker 1>education and culture.</v>

82
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So who cares if they're fraudulent</v>

83
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.983
<v Speaker 2>vapor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to look at those pains and love </v>

84
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:40.850
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're helping me</v>

85
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>as William James said in his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatism,</v>

86
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>a new name for some old ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

87
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.223
<v Speaker 1>The true is the name for whatever proves</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to be good in the way of belief </v>

88
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and good too for definite assignable </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

89
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>This idea of partial truths also comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>up later.</v>

90
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried that he's going to open his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth and say things that aren't true to</v>

91
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:05.581
<v Speaker 2>those vulgar puritans at the newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well perhaps true,</v>

92
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>but not the whole truth.</v>

93
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't think anyone at rock star is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading John Dewey and if you are,</v>

94
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.320
<v Speaker 1>please send me an email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this take on pragmatism as it's more</v>

95
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 1>commonly understood by non philosophers </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in line with red dead cynical take on</v>

96
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:22.670
<v Speaker 1>the value systems that propelled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west at the turn of the century.</v>

97
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Pragmatism is darkly cast as an ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>that more or less justifies selfish,</v>

98
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:28.940
<v Speaker 1>cynical behavior.</v>

99
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Education is the most wonderful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll raise us higher and higher.</v>

100
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Make civics and ethics lesser work of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty minded pragmatists like me and the</v>

101
00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 2>calling of higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better men here,</v>

102
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.294
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

103
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.173
<v Speaker 1>in part two of the mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this distinction between the </v>

104
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 1>dirty pragmatism of the mayor and John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marks.</v>

105
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:53.574
<v Speaker 1>Idealism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the mayor hires you to once again </v>

106
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>intimidate a man into funding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>library,</v>

107
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Arthur does what he does best and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper man gives in and libraries are</v>

108
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

109
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at these beautiful books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is magnificent.</v>

110
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>We'll bring this city back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it kills me,</v>

111
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.333
<v Speaker 1>I didn't probably shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if it requires a little bit of nasty </v>

112
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>business to get something done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it,</v>

113
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such pragmatic justifications for pretty</v>

114
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.684
<v Speaker 1>gnarly shit are all over both games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the essential conflict of the </v>

115
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>first game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened John's family in order to get</v>

116
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:31.184
<v Speaker 1>him to do what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the remaining members of the </v>

117
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.034
<v Speaker 1>gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the third and final part of the </v>

118
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:36.164
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see a final standoff between these </v>

119
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>two ideas systems.</v>

120

<v Speaker 1>When John Mark Turns on the mayor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his seeming lack of principals will </v>

121
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.384
<v Speaker 1>strive to improve the city's moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>backbone by any means available to us </v>

122
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>who we are then reasoning.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

124
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Within my reason because it's better to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get something done than nothing at all.</v>

125
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
