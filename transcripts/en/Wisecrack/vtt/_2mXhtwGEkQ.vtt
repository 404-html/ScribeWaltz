1
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Talking to the general public around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country is that most people don't have a</v>

2
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.284
<v Speaker 1>very high level of scientific literacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People seem to be afraid of science and </v>

3
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>certainly people seem to be afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>

4
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.523
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's such a shame because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's as hard as people </v>

5
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>seem to think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have this idea that if you're not</v>

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>brilliant like Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be a scientist.</v>

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>he was the one out of a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

10
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.413
<v Speaker 1>but there were 999,999</v>
<v Speaker 1>other scientists who are not as </v>

11
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>brilliant but to just do great science </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

12
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.283
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of the work that I do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to dispel these myths about science </v>

13
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>being on Arcane Hartfield and math being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comprehensible.</v>

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

15
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>we need to know math to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

16
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.534
<v Speaker 1>but math is a language and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn the language because that's the </v>

17
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>language of science.</v>

18
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go to Sweden or Ethiopia,</v>

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.093
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean I can't live in </v>

20
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>that country and function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to learn the language.</v>

21
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with science and math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn the language first and</v>

22
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>then you can work in those fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not mysterious and arcane.</v>

23
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of looking at the world in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of exploring the world and trying to</v>

24
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 1>make sense of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

25
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.394
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.393
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it disappoints me that people are so </v>

27
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>frightened of science and frightened the</v>
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>

28
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.983
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way we'll have a sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and people's appreciation of </v>

29
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

30
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>math is through a broad effort,</v>

31
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>partially part of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partially the work of scientists like me</v>

32
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:01.814
<v Speaker 1>who communicate to the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partially the parents of young kids not </v>

33
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>propagating myths about science is hard.</v>

34
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.491
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

35
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I never did well in math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a joint effort on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's part.</v>

38
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>People need to realize that the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

39
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different world than it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>2030 years ago.</v>

40
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And we have to be aware of that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

41
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:32.321
<v Speaker 1>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and recognize that the rest of the world</v>

42
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>is moving on and moving on pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

43
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.683
<v Speaker 1>And if we want to maintain the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort in our culture and society that </v>

44
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:41.384
<v Speaker 1>we've become accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to really get in there and we </v>

45
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:44.804
<v Speaker 1>have to educate our kids and bring them </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to speed with commensurate with </v>

46
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:52.150
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I worry that that's not right.</v>
