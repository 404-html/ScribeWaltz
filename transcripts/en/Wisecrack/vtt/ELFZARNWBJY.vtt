<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by blue apron a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack.</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.253
<v Speaker 1>Jared here today we're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that launched a thousand Halloween </v>

3
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stranger things,</v>

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.923
<v Speaker 1>pretty much every 20 something with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowed Netflix password is losing </v>

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:16.644
<v Speaker 1>their mind over season two but why is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone so obsessed with a show that's </v>

6
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>basically the goonies meet Fox mulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some may Pinot on the stall chip,</v>

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to argue it has a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with toys,</v>

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.123
<v Speaker 1>whether it's kids becoming the rulers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nation by engaging in literal warfare </v>

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>or an animated baby in a suit doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>espionage,</v>

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.203
<v Speaker 1>TV and movies about powerful children </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to age them up in order to </v>

11
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate their abilities rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking seriously.</v>

12
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:46.104
<v Speaker 1>The potential of childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Childhood is either something to be </v>

13
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>overcome or just comic juxtaposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>against their adult roles.</v>

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.243
<v Speaker 1>What makes stranger things unique is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the kids win by being kit rather </v>

15
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>than by growing up or pretending to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.863
<v Speaker 1>By paying attention to the way stranger </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in Birch that convention and </v>

17
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>shows the inherent power of children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can perhaps better understand why the</v>

18
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>series resonates so much for </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials.</v>

19
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Being a kid at heart doesn't mean you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>regressing.</v>

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it means being a total bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.973
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wisecrack addition on stranger </v>

22
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>things and as always spoilers ahead if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get caught up.</v>

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Here's a quick rundown on the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.833
<v Speaker 1>a decade before the start of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a secret government funded experiment </v>

25
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>kidnaps a girl names her 11 and it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>her use her psychic powers to spy on the</v>

26
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.274
<v Speaker 1>Soviets and whoops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summon a demon hell beast from another </v>

27
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This piece of tax,</v>

28
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>a boy named will and brings him back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really depressing home dimension,</v>

29
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>which is just like earth except the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere is full of Kleenex pieces and</v>

30
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>everything is kind of dam wills.</v>

31
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Three best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Lucas and Mike set out on a quest</v>

32
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>to find him once 11 escapes or creepy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake dad.</v>

33
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.073
<v Speaker 1>She joins the junior rescue crew and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest as they say is eight hours of </v>

34
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.484
<v Speaker 1>quality television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80s and 90s kid nostalgia certainly </v>

35
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>helped give rise to the popularity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

36
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>but that nostalgia extends far beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reach of Netflix.</v>

37
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>We also see a certain longing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past in the current millennial obsession</v>

38
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>with toys witnessed the insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity of Funko pop figurines,</v>

39
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:12.894
<v Speaker 1>hoverboards and subscription boxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with everything from star wars </v>

40
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:16.314
<v Speaker 1>pillows to Batman themed ramen bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toys as a symbol express </v>

41
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.514
<v Speaker 1>lightheartedness and innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also an important means for </v>

42
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:23.874
<v Speaker 1>rational and emotional connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers learn about the world through </v>

43
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>their toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children use toys to share or fight with</v>

44
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>friends and to act out the possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future.</v>

45
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Despite this many popular depictions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys trivialize their role,</v>

46
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.103
<v Speaker 1>labeled them as immature and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity has given rise to dozens of </v>

47
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>really think pieces on how millennials </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to grow up.</v>

48
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Stranger things takes toys seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not only an essential part of </v>

49
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:48.084
<v Speaker 1>the storyline there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundation on which the rest of the </v>

50
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:50.814
<v Speaker 1>story is built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The quintessential example of this is </v>

51
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:53.994
<v Speaker 1>the way that the language of dungeons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dragons is used to make sense of </v>

52
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>events both for our plucky gang of four </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the viewers themselves.</v>

53
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.533
<v Speaker 1>We were thinking of more of an able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention like do they look shadows when </v>

54
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>we first meet the boys in episode one </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in Mike's basement playing d and,</v>

55
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.864
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>The demo gorgon monster is first shown </v>

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.174
<v Speaker 1>is a figurine in their campaign and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they meet the interdimensional </v>

57
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>monster later on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about it in terms of a monster</v>

58
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>they are familiar with.</v>

59
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>This is one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demagoguery with your wrist rocket.</v>

60
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.140
<v Speaker 2>I took art to do to go into fight darth </v>
<v Speaker 2>vader.</v>

61
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>The same is true of the alternate </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

62
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>The Monster hails from as 11 tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain what this place is.</v>

63
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.423
<v Speaker 1>Nobody understands until she takes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign board and flips it upside down </v>

64
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>to represent an alternate and parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>side to our own reality.</v>

65
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.253
<v Speaker 1>Since those concepts are fundamental to </v>
<v Speaker 1>making sense of the paranormal element </v>

66
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>in the boys' lives there also </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental to the viewer.</v>

67
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.123
<v Speaker 1>We really have no way to understand or </v>
<v Speaker 1>express the upside down or the Demo </v>

68
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except through the language of d and d.</v>

69
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>That board and that figurine shaped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology for the entire series.</v>

70
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>We see the same kind of language framing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dustin's constant references to comic</v>

71
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>books and Star Wars.</v>

72
00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.973
<v Speaker 3>Do you think 11 was born with her powers</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the x men or do you think he </v>

73
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 3>acquired them like like Greenland here</v>

74
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.503
<v Speaker 1>to ham?</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 is one of the x men and the chief is </v>

75
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:09.474
<v Speaker 1>Lando Kalryzian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the boys think he's setting them </v>

76
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:11.934
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

77
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 2>what were the chief set us up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nancy,</v>

78
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 2>maybe Lado Corinthian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you shut up about Lando?</v>

79
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Dustin knows that Jean Grey has </v>
<v Speaker 1>telekinesis,</v>

80
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>so 11 similar powers don't seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

81
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.763
<v Speaker 1>His relationship to games and toys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoons gives him and the other </v>

82
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Speaker 1>children the ability to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's powerful.</v>

83
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is Hawkins.</v>

84
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 3>This is the robos.</v>

85
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.203
<v Speaker 1>In contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joy sees evidence of the paranormal and </v>

86
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it pretty much destroys her because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>has no way to communicate this knowledge</v>

87
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>to the other adults or even herself</v>

88
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.710
<v Speaker 2>is after him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said danger.</v>

89
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:50.930
<v Speaker 2>We have to find,</v>

90
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.950
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks she's cuckoo for cocoa </v>
<v Speaker 1>puffs because they simply don't have the</v>

91
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>right frame of reference to make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the events except for Mr.</v>

92
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.163
<v Speaker 1>Clark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His connection to childhood toys and </v>

93
00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:02.024
<v Speaker 1>Games makes him an understanding ally </v>
<v Speaker 1>who entertains the idea of an upside </v>

94
00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 1>down well before the other adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Speaker 1>that'll shadows echo of the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane where necrotic and shadow magic.</v>

96
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the significance of toys goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond just making sense of the Eggo.</v>

97
00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Snuffing demi goddess in the basement on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one level,</v>

98
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.703
<v Speaker 1>stranger things gives credibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys by showing that they have the </v>

99
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:22.004
<v Speaker 1>potential to be powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Lucas suggest bringing his wrist </v>

100
00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:27.530
<v Speaker 1>rocket on their adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even his friends make fun of him.</v>

101
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.960
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take out the demo Gorgon</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a slingshot,</v>

102
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.973
<v Speaker 1>and it's true that in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrist rocket gets literally beaten </v>

103
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>to the Punch by 11 psychic attack on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>demo.</v>

104
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.733
<v Speaker 1>Gorgon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may seem like it detracts from our </v>

105
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:39.164
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mere fact that the wrist rocket </v>

106
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:41.354
<v Speaker 1>was part of the fight shows that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be easily dismissed successfully </v>

107
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:45.920
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That slingshot,</v>

108
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.783
<v Speaker 1>that toy fought a monster from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension in the world of stranger </v>

109
00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:52.370
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toys become objects of great utility.</v>

110
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.383
<v Speaker 1>Nancy's costume chest provides 11 the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to move around comfortably in </v>

111
00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can go to school,</v>

112
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>meet adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and navigate the world more easily after</v>

113
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>she plays dress up without the new found</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence provided by the dress and the</v>

114
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.174
<v Speaker 1>blonde wig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 wouldn't have found will on the heat </v>

115
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>hit radio or saved Mike from the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullies.</v>

116
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
<v Speaker 1>She has super powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a dress up bin did something that </v>

117
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.903
<v Speaker 1>esp couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can also see the utility of toys and </v>

118
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>will's homeaway from home castle buyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a kid's fort built in the backyard,</v>

119
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>but it probably saves his life when he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the upside down.</v>

120
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Not only does it shelter him from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Demo Gorgon,</v>

121
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.193
<v Speaker 1>at least for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also somewhat implied that the </v>

122
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:29.834
<v Speaker 1>sense of familiarity and comfort </v>
<v Speaker 1>provided by the Fort helps to keep him </v>

123
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>alive in the toxic atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps one of the most obvious examples</v>

124
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 1>is the scene where Joyce and 11 pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>together a makeshift sensory deprivation</v>

125
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>tank so that our girl Elle can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension hopping.</v>

126
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.693
<v Speaker 1>They go to a school and Philip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Kiddie pool that was once used to bob </v>

127
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.724
<v Speaker 1>for apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This scenario despite the participation </v>

128
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.664
<v Speaker 1>of the adults is so laden with kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fueled ingenuity that it's almost over </v>

129
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.654
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that kitty pool that makes it </v>

130
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>possible for 11 to discover barbs body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the role of toys in the show,</v>

131
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.164
<v Speaker 1>it's a little less blatant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might've forgotten the scenes were </v>

132
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.804
<v Speaker 1>11 practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her powers on the Millennium Falcon </v>

133
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.114
<v Speaker 1>figurine or when we'll get an Atari for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas at the end of the first </v>

134
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:08.504
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely an Atari and Atari by making </v>

135
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>toys.</v>

136
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.933
<v Speaker 1>A constant presence in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stranger things emphasizes their </v>

137
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>omnipresence and importance in the lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>of children.</v>

138
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>The significance of toys isn't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to the kids either.</v>

139
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.553
<v Speaker 1>There are also a few occasions where </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys are important tools for teens and </v>

140
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:26.954
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joyce's alphabet light display looks an </v>

141
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.384
<v Speaker 1>awful lot like a wiki board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nancy and Jonathan basically recreate </v>

142
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>home alone to catch a monster and top it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off with a smiley face.</v>

143
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Yoyo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan's very fancy camera is referred</v>

144
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 1>to as his toy was have to take away his </v>
<v Speaker 1>toy.</v>

145
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Please got the camera and it's key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>documenting the existence of the demic </v>

146
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 1>organ by first producing another toy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a puzzle.</v>

147
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>These examples all point to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

148
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 1>The Times when the teens and adults are </v>
<v Speaker 1>most successful at fighting the enemy or</v>

149
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>understanding the world are when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopt the conventions of kids.</v>

150
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just children having power.</v>

151
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.753
<v Speaker 1>It's the power of childhood itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see an interesting presentation </v>

152
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.744
<v Speaker 1>of this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the walkie talkies and </v>

153
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:08.264
<v Speaker 1>the campuses used in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radios and campuses are not inherently </v>

154
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:12.254
<v Speaker 1>toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're primarily used for adults for </v>

155
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>distinctly uncoil like purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in stranger things.</v>

156
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.623
<v Speaker 1>They are toys used by the boys as a form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of play prior to taking on their </v>

157
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:21.554
<v Speaker 1>strategic roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The walkie talkies are vital for </v>

158
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:24.494
<v Speaker 1>communication during the search for will</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the magnetic misdirection of the </v>

159
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>campuses leads the gang to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that the portal is inside the</v>

160
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.713
<v Speaker 1>Department of Energy Facility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't see the adults using them </v>

161
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>to similar effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police have radios,</v>

162
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.334
<v Speaker 1>but they never hold the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power or usefulness as the toy radios </v>

163
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.054
<v Speaker 1>belonging to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stranger things takes toys seriously </v>

164
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>because it takes childhood itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

165
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 1>The kids don't save the day despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>being kids.</v>

166
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>They save the day because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

167
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.513
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that everyone loving </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show wishes they were actually 10 </v>

168
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:55.574
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

169
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't deal with troy and his elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the fun dips in the world,</v>

170
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but stranger things fights back against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that being a kid or liking toys</v>

171
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:03.924
<v Speaker 1>is some sort of deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't just nostalgia in </v>

172
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>remembering childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's power to,</v>

173
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.683
<v Speaker 1>so what does it mean to give toys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of influence by empowering </v>

174
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.254
<v Speaker 1>childhood is stranger things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fanning the flames of our nostalgia </v>

175
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:16.194
<v Speaker 1>driven culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it fighting against that by making </v>

176
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>childhood into something more than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironic tee shirt?</v>

177
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're happy to keep watching season two </v>

178
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.520

<v Speaker 1>want something a little more </v>

180
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>substantial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry.</v>
