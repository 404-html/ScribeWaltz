<v Speaker 1>Surprise.</v>

117
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes your dreams get on by reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boys do to become just as bunk as his </v>

118
00:06:56.731 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 1>pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pursued by something all at once.</v>

119
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>My sister touches my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turn around and look into her eyes.</v>

120
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.143
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura,</v>

121
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Laura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to leave you behind me,</v>

122
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>but I am more faithful than I intended </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

123
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.203
<v Speaker 1>Jim was top dog in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he had low level scrub busting </v>

124
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:15.824
<v Speaker 1>his ass at a warehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even he living in a world of Bush </v>

125
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.280
<v Speaker 1>saying he taken public speaking courses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to shoot him to the top boy</v>

126
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:25.814
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way these cats can escape the </v>

127
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:32.741
<v Speaker 1>prison of their real lives is the lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves over and over until it sticks</v>

128
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>t we'll slang and repetition all up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his tax.</v>

129
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.123
<v Speaker 1>To make that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda always talking about some flower </v>

130
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:44.471
<v Speaker 1>called John quills to bring her back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good old days of attendance and rich</v>

131
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 1>on dogs.</v>

132
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Our so lovely that country and may </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally flooded with John quills.</v>

133
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>That was the summer I had the craze for </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Quinones.</v>

134
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>John quinones became an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>

135
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Mother said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

136
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.423
<v Speaker 1>there's no more room for John Quills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still kept on bringing in more </v>

137
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>John quills whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever I saw him,</v>

138
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

139
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

140
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>John Quilts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made.</v>

141
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>The young men helped me gather the John </v>
<v Speaker 1>quills.</v>

142
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda,</v>

143
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Quills.</v>

144
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.503
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no more advisors to hold </v>

145
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.694
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every available space was filled with </v>

<v Speaker 1>Keep dropping the words movies and move </v>

147
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.533
<v Speaker 1>the shelly itching to escape this type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of flow as a special kind of repetition </v>

148
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>called Politiken when you repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas they got the same routes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>

152
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of the movies and I am about </v>
