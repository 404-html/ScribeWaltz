00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm to call him.</v>

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 2>What's up everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jared again,</v>

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.953
<v Speaker 2>today we're talking about a show that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely going to get us d monetized </v>

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 2>on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bursar based off the Monga,</v>

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 2>the same name reserve is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oldest ongoing series out there.</v>

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.733
<v Speaker 2>The Nma premiered in 1997 before going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on an almost 20 year hiatus and as </v>

7
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 2>returned with a controversial new </v>
<v Speaker 2>animation style.</v>

8
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.263
<v Speaker 2>Since the show is still going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't quite decipher the entire </v>

9
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:28.714
<v Speaker 2>message here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while guts quest for revenge against </v>

10
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:31.444
<v Speaker 2>the God hand in Griffith deals with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly obvious themes ranging from </v>

11
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 2>religion to freewill.</v>

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

13
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Now that any meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no cause it to you to Dr [inaudible],</v>

14
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>we're going to leave that for a future </v>
<v Speaker 2>video instead.</v>

15
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.114
<v Speaker 2>We're here to talk about the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>visually obvious and philosophically </v>

16
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 2>subtle aspect of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Preserves metric crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of violence Wolgan Ms.</v>

18
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Wise crack condition on the philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of violence in Berzerk and as always,</v>

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 2>spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

20
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I know it might seem like the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindless violence was coined to describe</v>

21
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:03.524
<v Speaker 2>Berzerk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's going on beneath the surface </v>

22
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 2>of its bdsm inspired angels and gruesome</v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths is actually pretty smart.</v>

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.573
<v Speaker 2>Reserve is unique not only in how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses violence to horrify and mesmerize </v>

24
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to transform us.</v>

25
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand the violence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Berzerk?</v>

26
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 2>We need to consider its genre while the </v>
<v Speaker 2>influences of psychological horror,</v>

27
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:22.964
<v Speaker 2>cosmic horror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even core porn can be seen in </v>

28
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.334
<v Speaker 2>reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show specifically rests in horrors </v>

29
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 2>monster sub genre according to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stratasys,</v>

30
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 2>no carol monster horror has two very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important implications.</v>

31
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.723
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror as a genre affords us a critical </v>

32
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 2>distance allowing for a safe space for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascination to take root.</v>

33
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Simply put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence in real life is bad,</v>

34
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>but violence on screen is kosher to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters depicted on screen embody.</v>

35
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.103
<v Speaker 2>With Carol calls categorical violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They defy traditional categorizations </v>

36
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>and simultaneously attract and repulse </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the same reason.</v>

37
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 2>It's these two points that make Berzerk </v>
<v Speaker 2>so well preserved.</v>

38
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.183
<v Speaker 2>Why are we okay with witnessing guts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally slice people in half because </v>

39
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 2>we view this over the top violence from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a safe distance and why do we find these</v>

40
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.014
<v Speaker 2>awful acts of violence so compelling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because violence in the show like it's </v>

41
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 2>subject matter defies traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorizations.</v>

42
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.483
<v Speaker 2>This blurring of typical categories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fascination and repulsion that it </v>

43
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:20.774
<v Speaker 2>generates is berzerk calling card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These binaries can be distinctions </v>

44
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:24.824
<v Speaker 2>between life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as when Guts Mo's down at group of </v>

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 2>animated skeletons or the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between man and beast and the apostles,</v>

46
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 2>but they can also be less literal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

47
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:34.784
<v Speaker 2>Father Mo's goose head bulging sadist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary claims to be an agent of </v>

48
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 2>God but is actually serving the demons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and his rag tag team of tortures even</v>

49
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 2>gain wings as if they're literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>angels,</v>

50
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.663
<v Speaker 2>Lady Far Niece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now seeing the truth behind her order </v>

51
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 2>realizes what they actually are.</v>

52
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.253
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

53
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.593
<v Speaker 2>even guts the epicenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show's violence embodies this idea </v>

54
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.314
<v Speaker 2>of categorical violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's both a murderer and a hero and </v>

55
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>object of religious prophecy and an anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious crusader in the original anime</v>

56
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>guts is branded as a ritual sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the god hand.</v>

57
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 2>A moment that was supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>preordained,</v>

58
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>but guts managed to defy faith and </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

59
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.913
<v Speaker 2>Guts is simultaneously an object of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious prophecy and a middle finger </v>

60
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:32.671
<v Speaker 2>against faith or as far DC originally </v>
<v Speaker 2>sees him and how guts sees himself.</v>

61
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

62
00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:43.674
<v Speaker 4>Let's cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you cut a [inaudible] molecule down </v>

63
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.810
<v Speaker 4>with day to day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] it okay.</v>

64
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.063
<v Speaker 2>And much like the man himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guts is violence possesses this </v>

65
00:03:57.741 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker 2>trademark sense of categorical </v>
<v Speaker 2>violation.</v>

66
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.570
<v Speaker 2>It repels us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get attracts us.</v>

67
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>It's animalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet refined.</v>

68
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.103
<v Speaker 2>This is most apparent when guts puts on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brazer armor and blurs the line </v>

69
00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:10.304
<v Speaker 2>between man and beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His armor even transforming to mirror </v>

70
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:13.874
<v Speaker 2>this change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As guts releases a savage cry and </v>

71
00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:16.754
<v Speaker 2>charges the battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't help but notice the compelling </v>

72
00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:21.980
<v Speaker 2>choreographed ferocity here as his </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent.</v>

73
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:22.814
<v Speaker 2>Grunfeld note</v>

74
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 5>taken to sue Minneola new employee.</v>

75
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 2>And when guts delivers the final blow of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first bout,</v>

76
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 2>he does so with a grace that is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything.</v>

77
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Well beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it might seem strange,</v>

78
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.743
<v Speaker 2>according to thinker Joel Black and act </v>
<v Speaker 2>of violence can in fact be beautiful in </v>

79
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 2>his book the aesthetics of murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes,</v>

80
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 2>if any human act evokes the aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of the sublime,</v>

81
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.683
<v Speaker 2>certainly it is the act of murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If murder can be experienced </v>

82
00:04:57.841 --> 00:04:58.674
<v Speaker 2>aesthetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the murderer can in turn be regarded as </v>

83
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:01.614
<v Speaker 2>a kind of artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a performance artist or anti artists </v>

84
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>whose specialty is not creation but </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

85
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.993
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not giving the thumbs up to </v>

86
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:11.334
<v Speaker 2>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but blacks point is that when performed </v>

87
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:17.960
<v Speaker 2>with the right craft style and force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence can have an almost transcendent</v>

88
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 2>effect on its viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that something can leave us in</v>

89
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 2>awe and transcend understanding is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher Emmanuel Kant referred to as</v>

90
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:31.650
<v Speaker 2>the sublime or the state of mind created</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a certain experience stops being an</v>

91
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.620
<v Speaker 2>object of our judgment and starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling it.</v>

92
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Starting to sound familiar like monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoard,</v>

93
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:38.364
<v Speaker 2>the sublime has the power to violate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose in respect of the judgment and </v>

94
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:42.654
<v Speaker 2>to do violence to the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works through a process of </v>

95
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:46.404
<v Speaker 2>categorical violation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking down the divisions between our </v>

96
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:49.644
<v Speaker 2>commonly held beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how does the sublime and preserve </v>

97
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 2>transform us by forcing us to reconsider</v>
<v Speaker 2>our traditionally held ideas,</v>

98
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>specifically beauty throughout both the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new series and the 1997 version,</v>

99
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>we are bombarded with intensely violence</v>
<v Speaker 2>images that are in their own way.</v>

100
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.153
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Griffith in his band of heroes are </v>

101
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.723
<v Speaker 2>monsters liberate for tennis from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>invading who Shaun's Griffith see or </v>

102
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Sonia comments on the aftermath?</v>

103
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.680
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're this time.</v>

104
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Here are the senseless death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction wrought by griffiths army.</v>

105
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelmed Sonia possessing a beauty </v>
<v Speaker 2>that challenges her very idea of what is</v>

106
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 2>through tapping into the sublime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Violence in Berzerk frequently becomes a</v>

107
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:46.264
<v Speaker 2>vehicle for change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sonya opening her eyes to the dazzling </v>

108
00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:49.984
<v Speaker 2>death brought by griffith leaves her old</v>
<v Speaker 2>life in the village behind and follows </v>

109
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 2>griffith on his journey to become God </v>
<v Speaker 2>kit,</v>

110
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.973
<v Speaker 2>but for Zurich is very careful to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure it doesn't depict all violence as </v>

111
00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:02.020
<v Speaker 2>evoking this sense of awe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

112
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:02.854
<v Speaker 2>the show juxtaposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artful killing of guts and griffith </v>

113
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Speaker 2>with ordinary violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly common to everyday life,</v>

114
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.663
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the villagers stoning </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to death or a night whipping a </v>

115
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:14.230
<v Speaker 2>prostitute from the comfort of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse.</v>

116
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.430
<v Speaker 2>These moments are strangely mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>petty and underwhelming.</v>

117
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these figures,</v>

118
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>institutions lack the skill and artistry</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evoke the sublime.</v>

119
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 2>If skill and craftsmanship are the keys </v>
<v Speaker 2>to evoking total awe and wonder,</v>

120
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Ben Guts can be viewed as something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a violent performance artists.</v>

121
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.933
<v Speaker 2>So what's the effect of guts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a visceral and bloody art doesn't </v>

122
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.683
<v Speaker 2>have a greater purpose or is it just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>French writer tail field got ta calls </v>

123
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.580
<v Speaker 2>art for Art's sake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it might be tempting to think it's</v>

124
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:46.414
<v Speaker 2>the latter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guts is acts of violence do have a </v>

125
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:49.144
<v Speaker 2>greater purpose demonstrating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hideous nature of the societal violence </v>

126
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.523
<v Speaker 2>and ultimately disrupting it through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between artistic and non </v>

127
00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:57.994
<v Speaker 2>artistic acts of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show glorifies those that work </v>

128
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.413
<v Speaker 2>against the grain of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contrasting them with the drab cruelty </v>

129
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:05.524
<v Speaker 2>of the institutions themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A prime example is griffith when he's </v>

130
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:09.604
<v Speaker 2>reporting to the world fulfilling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wishes of the egg of the perfect world </v>

131
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:13.990
<v Speaker 2>to up end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Order</v>

132
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no to to cure.</v>

133
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.220
<v Speaker 7>So No [inaudible] statutes to Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so stay [inaudible].</v>

134
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.790
<v Speaker 7>She was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Touch</v>

135
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.970
<v Speaker 2>true to this cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Griffith and his army.</v>

136
00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Take back for Tanis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this instance,</v>

137
00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Griffith is working against society is </v>
<v Speaker 2>upstart rebel army ousting the coo.</v>

138
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:46.584
<v Speaker 2>Sean's in one fell swoop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once Griffith Regan states the holy </v>

139
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:50.814
<v Speaker 2>seize control of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He becomes in meshed in the established </v>

140
00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:54.174
<v Speaker 2>power structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typical the violence perpetrated by </v>

141
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ribbons,</v>

142
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.643
<v Speaker 2>violence afterwards becomes tasteless </v>
<v Speaker 2>and crude when guts and company arrived </v>

143
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.264
<v Speaker 2>later at the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find hundreds of slave traders </v>

144
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>hanged as enemies of the state bar from </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessing beauty.</v>

145
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.144
<v Speaker 2>This scene is sterile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>methodically organized and revolting to </v>

146
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 2>sharecrop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike Griffith,</v>

147
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 2>though guts is violence is never part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a greater societal system.</v>

148
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Guts fights only for himself making </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies out of whole armies,</v>

149
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>religions and even God like beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

150
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.164
<v Speaker 2>the brand on guts is nick attracts </v>
<v Speaker 2>demons and apostles continually forcing </v>

151
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>guts to abandoned society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the first episode,</v>

152
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 2>guts attempts to reenter society by </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeing to take a carriage dried with a</v>

153
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:36.114
<v Speaker 2>kindly man and his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guts falls asleep only for his brand to </v>

154
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 2>attract demons who slaughtered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

155
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Daughter duo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

156
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.404
<v Speaker 2>guts is curse to live and act on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>peripheries of society is violence </v>

157
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 2>becomes a destructive force upon the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

158
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.543
<v Speaker 2>Lady for niece realizes this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she becomes disillusioned with the </v>

159
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:53.371
<v Speaker 2>holy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

160
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 2>as all hell breaks loose on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield.</v>

161
00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:00.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could I can let us know.</v>

162
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Mrs [inaudible]</v>

163
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.283
<v Speaker 2>Guts is violence invoking the sublime </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a powerful force that disrupts </v>

164
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:10.724
<v Speaker 2>the status quo and forces people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>renegotiate their core ideals for far </v>

165
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:15.314
<v Speaker 2>niece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This results in her abandoning her post </v>

166
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.320
<v Speaker 2>and even her God.</v>

167
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Could I take your statement</v>

168
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.873
<v Speaker 2>in tying artistic violence to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and unartistic violence to </v>

169
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 2>society for circus challenging us on </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we focus our attention while we're</v>

170
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:35.634
<v Speaker 2>drawn to be shining brilliance of guts </v>
<v Speaker 2>is violence or seemingly blind to the </v>

171
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 2>everyday violence that takes place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the greater world of Berserk.</v>

172
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 2>We as viewers live for the battle </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes,</v>

173
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:45.564
<v Speaker 2>the crystallization of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this ignores the existence of </v>

174
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:49.254
<v Speaker 2>structural violence or the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain power structures can prevent </v>

175
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 2>less powerful groups of people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting their basic needs.</v>

176
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.083
<v Speaker 2>True to form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look who gets screwed over by society </v>

177
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.054
<v Speaker 2>and preserve it should Doro is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially forced into servitude being </v>

178
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 2>the glorified busboy of a mercenary </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

179
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Costco essentially a mental invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's singled out for death by father,</v>

180
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:10.344
<v Speaker 2>most gurus and almost raped by a strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>fertility cult thing and Luca and her </v>

181
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:15.504
<v Speaker 2>gaggle of young friends are forced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk their lives by working as </v>

182
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:18.744
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes at the base camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both servicing military officers while </v>

183
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:25.400
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously fearing those are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>officer's judgments for circus.</v>

184
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Challenging our ideas of what piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>really is.</v>

185
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 2>We like to think that peace begins when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle stops,</v>

186
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.063
<v Speaker 2>when guts has finished putting his </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponents through the proverbial </v>

187
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:34.704
<v Speaker 2>blender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because we can't take our eyes away </v>

188
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 2>from dazzling acts of violence committed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by guts and others were unable to notice</v>

189
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 2>or care about all the other acts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence committed by society.</v>

190
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.933
<v Speaker 2>It's in the lols between battles when </v>
<v Speaker 2>reserve decides to show us the artless </v>

191
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 2>and repulsive violence in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them.</v>

192
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 2>In these rare moments when we see people</v>
<v Speaker 2>stoned death or mountains of dead bodies</v>

193
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 2>or even a lake of blood and in trails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see the limitations of thinking.</v>

194
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 2>That piece is simply the absence of war </v>
<v Speaker 2>or battle.</v>

195
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>But for all those complex intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

196
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 2>we don't blame you if you only remember </v>
