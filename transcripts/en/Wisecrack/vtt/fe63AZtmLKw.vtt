00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.713
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared here and today we're diving back </v>

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.144
<v Speaker 1>into black mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fourth season of this modern </v>

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>twilight zone just dropped on Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with it some truly thought provoking</v>

7
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.821
<v Speaker 1>episodes including a loving homage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>star trek and Apache helicopter parents,</v>

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and they rather utopian alternative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tinder in the wake of season three super</v>

9
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:28.374
<v Speaker 1>popular San Junipero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show has traded it's trademark </v>

10
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>pessimism for a slightly more positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>tone,</v>

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.093
<v Speaker 1>injecting a measure of justice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness previously unseen in the </v>

12
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:39.324
<v Speaker 1>series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the season finale where the </v>

13
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>show does something drastically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.423
<v Speaker 1>Black Museum not only provides the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept technological nightmare that </v>

15
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.534
<v Speaker 1>we've come to expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but reflects on the legacy and function </v>

16
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a whole,</v>

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.483
<v Speaker 1>black museum asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is even the purpose of Black </v>

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Mirror?</v>

19
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.373
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack quick take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of black museum and </v>

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.133
<v Speaker 1>obviously spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The episode follows a young woman named </v>

21
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.124
<v Speaker 1>niche as she's given a private tour by </v>
<v Speaker 1>proprietor Rolo Haynes of the eponymous </v>

22
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.294
<v Speaker 1>black museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tourist trap that houses a collection </v>

23
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>of authentic criminological artifacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viewers will be sure to spot a number of</v>

24
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:16.734
<v Speaker 1>prominent props from past episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the DNA analyzer from USS </v>

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Callister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parental control pad from Archangel </v>

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.903
<v Speaker 1>be bloody bathtub from crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the strange symbol mark ski </v>

27
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>masks from White Bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are more than just Easter eggs.</v>

28
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.863
<v Speaker 1>There are visual clues to the viewer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Black Museum is a Meta textual </v>

29
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.814
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the show itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artifacts that contain serve as a </v>

30
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>physical representation of the episodes </v>
<v Speaker 1>they appeared in,</v>

31
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.773
<v Speaker 1>and even the name black museum is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately evocative of the show's </v>

32
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:46.074
<v Speaker 1>title Black Mirror like the holiday </v>
<v Speaker 1>special white Christmas black museum is </v>

33
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:50.604
<v Speaker 1>an anthology within an anthology with </v>
<v Speaker 1>three separate subplots loosely </v>

34
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:54.834
<v Speaker 1>connected by Rolo Haynes is narration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and utilizing this same methodology </v>

35
00:01:58.321 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

36
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Black Museum is mirroring the format of </v>
<v Speaker 1>black mirror,</v>

37
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but if the exhibits in the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent past episodes,</v>

38
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>what do the three new gadgets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Dawson's lymphatic diagnoser,</v>

39
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.283
<v Speaker 1>the monkey stuff with Carrie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and Clayton Lee's </v>

40
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.254
<v Speaker 1>holographic holding cell represent each </v>
<v Speaker 1>item is an interface for human </v>

41
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:17.844
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more direct means of what television </v>

42
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:20.934
<v Speaker 1>and social media already do today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fictional items represent the </v>

43
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:24.804
<v Speaker 1>different ways our current technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>both connects and disconnects us as a </v>

44
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.334
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin's implant connects him and his </v>

45
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>patients signaling their sensations to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him via the hairnet.</v>

46
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.274
<v Speaker 1>Looking headgear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The upload which inserts carries mind </v>

47
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.064
<v Speaker 1>into the backseat of Jack's brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows her to see and feel as he does </v>

48
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>and the thin string separating Clayton's</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness from the museum.</v>

49
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.374
<v Speaker 1>Visitors creates emotional distance akin</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the distance between fictionalized </v>

50
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:50.694
<v Speaker 1>characters and desensitize audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawson subplot comments on media's </v>

51
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:55.794
<v Speaker 1>ability to let us empathize with </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and experience thrills </v>

52
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>without any physical ramifications.</v>

53
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you could feel exactly what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient feels minus the physical </v>

54
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.634
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack and Carrie story reflects media's </v>

55
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>ability to turn us into voyeurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clayton story reflects on the guilt free</v>

56
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>gratification we get from consuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in media.</v>

57
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.893
<v Speaker 1>In all of these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology allows individuals to </v>

58
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>experience things vicariously like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitchhiker,</v>

59
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>like a passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vicarious sensations.</v>

60
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>She sees what you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she feels what you feel.</v>

61
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.163
<v Speaker 1>This episode dramatizes what all fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally does and what Black Mirror as </v>

62
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>a television program does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically all fiction is delivered to</v>

63
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>us via a medium in the case of black </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror through television.</v>

64
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Television itself is enroll those words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a receiver for human experiences and one</v>

65
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>that often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Rolo says,</v>

66
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.183
<v Speaker 1>offers no privacy for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no agency for her with a particularly </v>

67
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.614
<v Speaker 1>compelling show like Black Mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We become increasingly invested and </v>

68
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:03.934
<v Speaker 1>share in the same sense of joy in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Junipero as Kelly and Yorkie the same </v>

69
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:08.494
<v Speaker 1>indignation as being in 15 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>merits and the same initial prejudices </v>

70
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>and gradual awakening as stripe in men </v>
<v Speaker 1>against fire.</v>

71
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>For philosopher Martha Nussbaum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of connection is emblematic of</v>

72
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roles in one's moral development.</v>

73
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Narratives according to Nussbaum free us</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the parochial confines over our own</v>

74
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 1>lives and place us in a position both </v>
<v Speaker 1>like and unlike our own like in that we </v>

75
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>are emotionally involved with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>

76
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>active with them and aware of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>incompleteness,</v>

77
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.593
<v Speaker 1>unlike in that we're free of certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources of distortion that frequently </v>

78
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>impede our real life deliberations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

79
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>take a character like being in 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million merits.</v>

80
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>His love for abby might remind us of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own lives,</v>

81
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>but unlike being we're not sent on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>downward spiral when that love is lost,</v>

82
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>yet we can still experience it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

83
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Black Museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

84
00:04:58.511 --> 00:04:59.344
<v Speaker 1>explores the danger of this distancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect through Dr Dawson subplot and </v>

85
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.814
<v Speaker 1>it's here that the episode looks at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially desensitizing nature of the </v>

86
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>series owned violent imagery,</v>

87
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>more pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt pleasure,</v>

88
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.930
<v Speaker 2>God</v>

89
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.720
<v Speaker 1>in a series which premiered with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister of Britain.</v>

90
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.023
<v Speaker 1>A pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maintaining that same sense of shock </v>

91
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>requires increasingly more shocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

92
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.643
<v Speaker 1>Bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to surprise audiences in shut </v>

93
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.390
<v Speaker 1>up and dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By revealing that the protagonist they'd</v>

94
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 1>been rooting for had been into Kiddie </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn,</v>

95
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 2>only to</v>

96
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.940
<v Speaker 1>be topped in the subsequent season in </v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile.</v>

97
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.953
<v Speaker 1>As we experienced an average human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioned from innocence to </v>

98
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 1>infanticide because a baby per rolo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the show progressed,</v>

99
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.023
<v Speaker 1>our relationship with pain had shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not merely desensitized to the </v>

100
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:51.824
<v Speaker 1>violence on screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take a twisted kind of pleasure in </v>

101
00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the discomfort it inflicts upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

102
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like eating chilis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your climate eyes fast.</v>

103
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>First Time we had a Jalapeno that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>spat it out too hot,</v>

104
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>persevere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes addictive,</v>

105
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.873
<v Speaker 1>but black museum is ultimately not </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologetic for engaging in such extreme </v>

106
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.374
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing through its third subplot that </v>

107
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the show is not empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensationalism,</v>

108
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>but rather has a purpose motivating it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the main exhibit of Black Museum.</v>

109
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>We see what remains of Clayton Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alleged murderer who is arrested.</v>

110
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Execution had been alluded to throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>the episode like carrying the Monkey.</v>

111
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.343
<v Speaker 1>His consciousness continues on even </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the exploration of his physical </v>

112
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.364
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be at this time as a self aware </v>

113
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:36.884
<v Speaker 1>hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the museum's grand attraction </v>

114
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>visitors are invited to pull the switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

115
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>not merely inflicting real torture on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Lee,</v>

116
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.893
<v Speaker 1>but in the process creating a sentience </v>
<v Speaker 1>souvenir that eternally experiences the </v>

117
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:53.621
<v Speaker 1>moment of execution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful juicing him out.</v>

118
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Subconscious session,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snapshot of Clayton,</v>

119
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.533
<v Speaker 3>not a recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a true copy of his mind perpetually </v>

120
00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 3>experiencing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but stuck</v>

121
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>forever in that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

122
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.643
<v Speaker 1>Similar to white Christmas in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cookie of Joe is confined to a virtual </v>

123
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>cabin for what he experiences as </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

124
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the punishment made perpetual that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most offenders,</v>

125
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>our innate sense of proportionality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he committed the crime,</v>

126
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>no finite offense could merit infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

127
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show forces us to empathize with one</v>

128
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:29.954
<v Speaker 1>character who may be a murderer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another absolutely guilty of </v>

129
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:33.824
<v Speaker 1>manslaughter and a child on Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't merely feel bad for them from </v>

130
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>the safe distance of our side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

131
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>We feel their pain with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>

132
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:43.904
<v Speaker 1>we feel a sense of vindication when our </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience surrogate niche revealed to be </v>

133
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Clayton's daughter and carrying her </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother inside her head,</v>

134
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.913
<v Speaker 1>enact retribution against Rolo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that niche seeing the </v>

135
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>suffering of her father or hearing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Kerry engender empathy in her.</v>

136
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that such empathy then motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>her to moral action.</v>

137
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.463
<v Speaker 1>This is black museum state went about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how Black Mirror sees itself and its </v>

138
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:07.544
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not desensitizing spectacle and </v>

139
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:10.694
<v Speaker 1>empty entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a cautionary tale about </v>

140
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:13.814
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of technology after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same mind sharing method which </v>

141
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:17.474
<v Speaker 1>caused Jack so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grief is shown as being beneficial to </v>

142
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:20.984
<v Speaker 1>niche and her mother rather black mirror</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees itself as serving the same role as </v>

143
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:25.514
<v Speaker 1>a long line of literature and science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction shows which connect us </v>

144
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>emotionally to their characters in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engender empathy and in turn,</v>

145
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>encourage us to enact justice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode arc.</v>

146
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Angel Art empathetic attachment to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly surveilled.</v>

147
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.394
<v Speaker 1>Sarah is supposed to incite us against </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar big mother surveillance systems </v>

148
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>pervading our lives or in the episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal head.</v>

149
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:47.204
<v Speaker 1>Our investment in Bella survival against</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is essentially Boston dynamics is </v>

150
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:56.021
<v Speaker 1>big dog invites us to scrutinize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>militarization of autonomous machines in</v>

151
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 1>all these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black communities able to raise our </v>

152
00:08:58.441 --> 00:08:59.274
<v Speaker 1>concerns for these societal issues as </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively as it does only because it </v>

153
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>first causes us to care for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters it's crafted.</v>

154
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.283
<v Speaker 1>Black Museum is the whole of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Mirror distilled down to a single </v>

155
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>episode preserving the same content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same format,</v>

156
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.993
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly the same purpose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see ourselves reflected in the black </v>

157
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>mirror that is our television screen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphone.</v>

158
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.153
<v Speaker 1>Engaging empathetically with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters were connected to buy that </v>

159
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:26.454
<v Speaker 1>screen and by doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding our moral imagination and </v>
