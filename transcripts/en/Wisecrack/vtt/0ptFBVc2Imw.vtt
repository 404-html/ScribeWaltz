1
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.841
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.841
<v Speaker 2>the dod is a huge bureaucracy and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a culture where the,</v>

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>it's called a Gotcha culture where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 2>anytime a bureaucrat makes a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line is shot,</v>

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.443
<v Speaker 2>light shines on them and Congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigates them and the General </v>

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.753
<v Speaker 2>Accountability Office goes after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this tremendous risk </v>

8
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 2>aversion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see government doing two things.</v>

9
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:34.994
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a look at a government </v>

10
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 2>document,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always in the passive verb,</v>

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 2>a verb form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things have happened,</v>

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 2>mistakes were made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who made them?</v>

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who made them.</v>

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 2>They were made because that way no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>has accountability and responsibility.</v>

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>If people were given a little more slack</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make mistakes,</v>

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>then they would probably be a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable.</v>

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it to the next level.</v>

18
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to reform anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reformed means change.</v>

19
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.663
<v Speaker 2>Reform Means Dynamo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dynamism reform means that you might be </v>

20
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 2>looked at in a way that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and before you could hide under,</v>

21
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>behind some piece of paper.</v>

22
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 2>So the bureaucracy hates reform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Rumsfeld came in,</v>

23
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to transform the Pentagon and </v>

24
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:18.884
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he did was ask me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the way we handled our financial </v>

25
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>management because nobody paid much </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to it.</v>

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I found was the people</v>

27
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:28.994
<v Speaker 2>who work in that area where themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>so dismissive of their work that they </v>

28
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 2>were nine to fivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd given up.</v>

29
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

30
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:39.254
<v Speaker 2>if they were working there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably because they weren't good </v>

31
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.230
<v Speaker 2>enough and it wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were very,</v>

32
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

33
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>we made some changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

34
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>we had a problem that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't account for all our </v>
<v Speaker 2>transactions.</v>

36
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes there was a zip code wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be,</v>

37
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't fit to the point of two </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half trillion dollars.</v>

38
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of transactions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be accounted for.</v>

39
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.903
<v Speaker 2>I started a process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think the problem isn't measured </v>

40
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>in a few millions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got rid of 99.9%</v>

41
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.344
<v Speaker 2>of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a lot of dedicated people to do </v>

42
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden they felt that,</v>

43
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was paying attention to them as </v>

44
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 2>undersecretary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more important,</v>

45
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.953
<v Speaker 2>the secretary of defense cared about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing and for bureaucrat </v>

46
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.023
<v Speaker 2>to recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that somebody wants to </v>

47
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:24.974
<v Speaker 2>criticize them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody cares about what they're </v>

48
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to respond differently.</v>

49
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
