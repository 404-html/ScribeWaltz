<v Speaker 1>know who Sasha Baron Cohen is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rose to fame in the late nineties for</v>

29
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>his brief segments on UK tvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 11 o'clock show,</v>

30
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.483
<v Speaker 1>which also gave rise to Ricky Gervais'.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His sketches were based around a </v>

31
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>character initially called the Youth </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lanka.</v>

32
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.513
<v Speaker 1>He was dressed like a stereotypical </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaff or a British insult for obnoxious </v>

33
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:41.894
<v Speaker 1>lower class kids who had delusions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of the gangster rap </v>

34
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.393
<v Speaker 1>character transformed into what we now </v>
<v Speaker 1>know as allergy allergy started by </v>

37
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:55.714
<v Speaker 1>interviewing British establishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures with pompous titles who are </v>

38
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>desperate to seem down with the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but predictably this always backfires</v>

39
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 2>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they bathed in us as milk.</v>

40
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>She often exposed how out of touch those</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians and academics could be.</v>

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>It's much more democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UC The rap scene.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Within a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won the British comedy award for best</v>

43
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:18.924
<v Speaker 1>newcomer his other characters bore at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bruno were also making appearances </v>

44
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>at the time and they all seem to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of finger on the pulse,</v>

45
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>confrontational satire that improves </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a hit with allergy.</v>

46
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.143
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years or hit movies and a major </v>

47
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:32.844
<v Speaker 1>animation franchise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later Cohen is back with his patented </v>

48
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>brand of character comedy in who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>America Auggie's.</v>

49
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.143
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all artificial prosthetics </v>

50
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>specially designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look just like my real aunts,</v>

51
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but his style of pissing off suits </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't just appear overnight.</v>

52
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Cohen had training from a surprising </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the mid Nineties Cohen,</v>

53
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it's ended and elite clown school in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris called Ecole Phillipe Galley.</v>

54
00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:58.984
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

55
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not technically a clown school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a performing art school,</v>

56
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.644
<v Speaker 1>but it is run by master clown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felipe golly eight who was a pupil of </v>

57
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:06.634
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my member formers shock McCook who </v>

58
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>followed in the footsteps of classics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mccloud's like Laurel and hardy,</v>

59
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before you start asking,</v>

60
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oversized novelty shoes,</v>

61
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>clowns are more than just red wigs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honky noses.</v>

62
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.003
<v Speaker 1>They have a pretty complicated history </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can help explain how we landed </v>

63
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:24.860
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

64
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.693
<v Speaker 2>Just remember to point puppy pistols </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth right at the middle of the bad </v>

65
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.490
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he has a big fat tummy pointed that</v>

66
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

67
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Back in 16th century Italy,</v>

68
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.983
<v Speaker 1>a type of traveling theater developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>called commedia Dell'arte that was </v>

69
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>performed on the back of a wagon by </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors in masks,</v>

70
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>which already seems creepy enough even </v>
<v Speaker 1>for clowns.</v>

71
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.093
<v Speaker 1>Commedia Dell'arte took the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketches and Improv with an elaborate </v>

72
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.484
<v Speaker 1>bit of slap stick performed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle by a character called the </v>

73
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Harlequin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.833
<v Speaker 1>sorta like her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The harlequin wore a checkered costume </v>

75
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:58.984
<v Speaker 1>and acted in silence mostly so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors didn't have to translate for the </v>

76
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:02.914
<v Speaker 1>different Italian dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This section of the performance came to </v>

77
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>be known as the pantomime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the 17th century.</v>

78
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Pantomimes were a whole show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contained a section called the Harlequin</v>

79
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:13.444
<v Speaker 1>aid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which introduced the character called </v>

80
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.903
<v Speaker 1>the clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clown was created as a buffoonish </v>

81
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.234
<v Speaker 1>companion to the Harlequin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their physical comedy left a trail of </v>

82
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:22.894
<v Speaker 1>destruction behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of humor that we see everywhere </v>

83
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.314
<v Speaker 1>around us today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were also borish and crude </v>

84
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Chrisman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nan's boyfriend and Derek Ima was telman</v>

85
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.573
<v Speaker 1>then that is kind of bilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many languages does that mean him </v>

86
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>speak and the word clown originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant rustic or peasant,</v>

87
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>meaning they were used as a depiction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest class in society.</v>

88
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is my neighbor symptoms.</v>

89
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>He is barely my ass holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the window from a glass.</v>

90
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The window from a glass.</v>

91
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.823
<v Speaker 1>These broader comedy moments of Cohen's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters certainly seem to live up to </v>

92
00:04:57.891 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Speaker 1>this classical definition of a clown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in those examples,</v>

93
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.023
<v Speaker 1>the clown is the one being laughed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen's humor is unique and that it </v>

94
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:08.990
<v Speaker 1>often turns the tables and gets the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience laughing at say,</v>

95
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Speaker 1>a Georgia state Rep.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll check you.</v>

98
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a theatrical tradition to that </v>

99
00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:17.564
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that is inextricably linked to </v>

100
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 1>clowned him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full building off commedia,</v>

101
00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:22.424
<v Speaker 1>Dell'Arte Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always can shakespeare develop the </v>

102
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 1>full character in his place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a mix of court,</v>

103
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Jester and clown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even occasionally called them clowns and</v>

104
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:32.804
<v Speaker 1>while they were certainly comic relief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other main role was to speak </v>

105
00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:36.554
<v Speaker 1>truth to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fool and Shakespeare tends to hang </v>

106
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:41.870
<v Speaker 1>around the important nobles and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of getting the laugh,</v>

107
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.823
<v Speaker 1>they often unexpectedly have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound to say and if they can say </v>

108
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:47.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one else can,</v>

109
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.060
<v Speaker 1>it's because everyone discounts them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idiot.</v>

110
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you think president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's your friend,</v>

111
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.250
<v Speaker 1>do you think he might've had a golden </v>
<v Speaker 1>shower?</v>

112
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Would surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

113
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.273
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's comedy 12th night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the character Fesa is often called a </v>

114
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>wise fool because he sums up the play's </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes and gives an honest assessment of</v>

115
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>the situation when the other characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

116
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's asked to sing,</v>

117
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.543
<v Speaker 1>instead of just performing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespearian equivalent of deaths </v>

118
00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:13.164
<v Speaker 1>Pasito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sings a song that explicitly states </v>

119
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the place themes of young love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's haste and it's follows.</v>

120
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.803
<v Speaker 1>Another important element of the fool is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're foolish just springs out </v>

121
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the stupidity in those around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a midsummer night's dream,</v>

122
00:06:30.721 --> 00:06:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the full character appropriately called </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

123
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>has his head literally turned into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass without realizing it.</v>

124
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare wasn't always subtle.</v>

125
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.223
<v Speaker 1>This is to make an ass of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's then left to wander the forest </v>

126
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:46.950
<v Speaker 1>where he meets the fairy Queen Titanium </v>
<v Speaker 1>who under the influence of a love potion</v>

127
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.903
<v Speaker 1>falls in love with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked hedanol bottom remains unaware of </v>

128
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:54.804
<v Speaker 1>his condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So entertains titanium is misguided </v>

129
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:58.074
<v Speaker 1>affection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allows the audience to literally </v>

130
00:06:59.911 --> 00:07:00.744
<v Speaker 1>laughed their asses off bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like allergy or bore at isn't </v>

131
00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:07.320
<v Speaker 1>mocking titanium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just an innocent fool.</v>

132
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>It's titanium that makes an ass of </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself similar to bottom,</v>

133
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.264
<v Speaker 1>making an ass of titanium by being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass g uses his own ass street to bring </v>

134
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:18.270
<v Speaker 1>out the ass in everyone around him.</v>

135
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be more better instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a vote in age,</v>

136
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 3>just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

137
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 3>if you as go cubes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can vote.</v>

138
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

139
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

140
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I would be willing to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some,</v>

141
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 3>a smaller way.</v>

142
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>In an early Bruno clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen interviews some of the coolest,</v>

143
00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:37.200
<v Speaker 1>hippest and wealthiest fashion designers</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a fashion show,</v>

144
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.490
<v Speaker 1>one of whom has produced a line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer trash fashion for the catwalk.</v>

145
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.503
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally like Mugatunes Dera leaked </v>

146
00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:44.994
<v Speaker 1>from zoo lander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruno asks her about this line of </v>

147
00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:50.100
<v Speaker 1>clothes and prompts the stylist pete </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight little too honest.</v>

148
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.073
<v Speaker 4>So 10 for Antonio Holmes says this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch trash trashing queer porter and </v>

149
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 4>where to buy as a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they can afford it.</v>

150
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.523
<v Speaker 1>Cohen is of course aware that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking at an upscale fashion show at </v>

151
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>poor people can buy the clothes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>display is stupid,</v>

152
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but this stupidity is just a foil to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to reveal what Cohen already knows.</v>

153
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>So you can see how Cohen takes this </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical archetype of a clown taught to</v>

154
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>him by Golly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aa and brought it up to date.</v>

155
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.693
<v Speaker 1>But besides foolishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clown can also bring out people's a </v>

156
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.210
<v Speaker 1>less than pleasant side too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by incorporating a racial stereotype and</v>

157
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.073
<v Speaker 1>nationalism or sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A clown can reveal prejudices better </v>

158
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:32.294
<v Speaker 1>than most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in four at sings and people sing </v>

159
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:37.724
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen is baiting people's prejudices by </v>

160
00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:44.370
<v Speaker 1>mirroring them or when Bhorat does this,</v>

161
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 4>every single man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman and child.</v>

162
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

163
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because we know he's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>clown,</v>

164
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's all so depressingly revealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of public opinion during the Iraq war.</v>

165
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>When Bruno and his partner make out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start undressing in the middle of a cage</v>

166
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the entire crowd doing this.</v>

167
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>But if all Cohen is doing is making an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass of people,</v>

168
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between him and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet trolls?</v>

169
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Trolls tried to elicit a strong reaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of their audience.</v>

170
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all so hostile and negative.</v>

171
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>The cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

172
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>has no malicious intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just stupid.</v>

173
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>A clown simply gives their targets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough rope to hang themselves with.</v>

174
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't imply anybody here is racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs,</v>

175
00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 2>not I'm racist toward Muslims,</v>

176
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.080
<v Speaker 1>but even then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever deeper purpose of clown has,</v>

177
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it should always come second to making </v>
<v Speaker 1>people laugh.</v>

178
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the first aim is to be as </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny as you can,</v>

179
00:09:47.831 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally you,</v>

180
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we end up uncovering some unpleasant </v>

181
00:09:52.361 --> 00:09:52.670
<v Speaker 2>truths.</v>

182
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.503
<v Speaker 1>So why do we think of clowns only as </v>
<v Speaker 1>white makeup wearing and poorly sized </v>

183
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:58.364
<v Speaker 1>motor vehicle driving child scares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we picture when someone says clown </v>

184
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:02.504
<v Speaker 1>today is known as the red cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was invented as a companion to be </v>

185
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:06.614
<v Speaker 1>original white clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The red clown was created in the 19th </v>

186
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:12.500
<v Speaker 1>century by actors and circus performers </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Joseph Per Maldi,</v>

187
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Jordahl Fox and Tom belling who </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously weren't funny enough without a</v>

188
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:17.114
<v Speaker 1>red nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the image that's taken over </v>

189
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.993
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's used as an insult or to </v>

190
00:10:21.711 --> 00:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>scare children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clowns have an image problem.</v>

191
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that art you Scalia is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've forgotten what a clown actually is</v>

192
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>and why clowns like Cohen are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

193
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.503
<v Speaker 1>A clown isn't defined by his makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has always been a muddle of </v>

194
00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:36.880
<v Speaker 1>different influences anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golly,</v>

195
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.650
<v Speaker 1>eight once a student has discovered his </v>
<v Speaker 1>clown,</v>

196
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>he no longer announces with his outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A clown doesn't need any of that stuff.</v>

197
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.650
<v Speaker 1>A clown is innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what separates a real clown from</v>

198
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A clown should be invisible.</v>

199
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.083
<v Speaker 1>A clown can slip amongst any group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the people who think that </v>

200
00:10:56.001 --> 00:10:57.410
<v Speaker 1>they're powerful or successful.</v>

201
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 2>You want to say big up yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll trust board boot trust,</v>

202
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.440
<v Speaker 2>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>galley,</v>

203
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.053
<v Speaker 2>respect,</v>

204
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 1>because the clown isn't seen as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>

205
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.540
<v Speaker 1>That's how clowns draw out their </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>

206
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:13.390
<v Speaker 1>In these same people like selfishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishness,</v>

207
00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:16.360
<v Speaker 1>childishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clumsiness and outright stupidity,</v>

208
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 1>which is why someone like Cohen can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Buchanan to admit that.</v>

209
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Is it ever worth fighting a war over </v>
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches?</v>

210
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Is it ever worth fighting a war?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

211
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.740
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or this in less than a month,</v>

212
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.233
<v Speaker 2>less than a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A first grader can become a first </v>

213
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.443
<v Speaker 2>Grenada</v>

214
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.000
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:40.834
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching who is America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably cringing along with me </v>

216
00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:44.134
<v Speaker 1>as Sasha tears apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our current cultural nightmare these </v>

217
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.423
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier and easier to face anxiety </v>

218
00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:50.644
<v Speaker 1>wherever you turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but luckily it's also easier than to </v>

219
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.244
<v Speaker 1>find help to cope with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this video is sponsored by better </v>

220
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The online counseling service.</v>

221
00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.523
<v Speaker 1>I actually tried it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke with a certified therapist named </v>

222
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was great.</v>

223
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>She was professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firmly qualified,</v>

224
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:10.180
<v Speaker 1>and was as good or better than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist I've seen in real life.</v>

225
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>My favorite things about better help our</v>
<v Speaker 1>one completely confidential too.</v>

226
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 1>It removes the stigma of looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>help and three,</v>

227
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>it can work around your schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the GIG economy,</v>

228
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to dedicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to a regular time slot,</v>

229
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 1>but with better help you determine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own therapy scheduled.</v>

230
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 1>You can communicate with the counselor </v>
<v Speaker 1>via message,</v>

231
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 1>live chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

232
