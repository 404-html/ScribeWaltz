<v Speaker 1>I think the celebrity chef phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

2
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>has gone on way longer than I expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be honest.</v>

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I have worked at a couple of big food </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines,</v>

5
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>food and wine and bon appetit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.203
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the celebrity chef phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 1>really started in the early to mid </v>

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.170
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really kind of exploded at that time.</v>

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Really led by people like emeril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been fantastic for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do it because it exposed people</v>

10
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:38.554
<v Speaker 1>to different cuisines and cultures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought everyone's palate's up </v>

11
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.113
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think it's time for farmers to be </v>

<v Speaker 1>the new celebrity chefs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a vital connection to the food is so </v>

15
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:56.854
<v Speaker 1>crucial and that they need to be getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of our claims and our love and </v>
