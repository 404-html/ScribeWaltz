1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Well ebooks or another method of taxed </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery.</v>

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did run a,</v>

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.083
<v Speaker 1>I ran a blog on the subject sometime ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was called three reasons for </v>

4
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>keeping paper books and the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons were uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.843
<v Speaker 1>solar flares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would wipe out communications </v>

6
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.084
<v Speaker 1>towers and not so well any electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>media that you might happen to have a </v>

7
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>stored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.073
<v Speaker 1>grand overload resulting in brownouts </v>
<v Speaker 1>which would have similar effects and </v>

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.023
<v Speaker 1>internet overload and less people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to build the grid out more and to </v>

10
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:40.884
<v Speaker 1>build the net out more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's pretty soon not going to be </v>

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>very much based on it because of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spam and torn,</v>

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>to the percentage of 95 I'm told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was very crowded there.</v>

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.963
<v Speaker 1>So building out the nat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building up the grid and what are you </v>

15
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>going to do about the solar flare as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well?</v>

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess a lead lined box is about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best you can do all of these things.</v>

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Point out the fact that electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>storage is pretty fragile.</v>

18
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>If you want to keep something </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently,</v>

19
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you should probably keep it in paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

20
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And that is why an e version of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>will is not acceptable.</v>

21
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is it's very hackable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forageable as I said,</v>

22
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>the net is leaky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
<v Speaker 1>and a number of other legal documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course drives people crazy </v>

24
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>because those paper things take up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much room.</v>

25
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's a problem facing businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What to do with the paper,</v>

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>why does the alternative to paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when can he is a storage,</v>

27
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a problem for people.</v>

28
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with small apartments who liked to read,</v>

29
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>where are they going to put all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>books?</v>

30
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>The ereader gives you portability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you instant accessibility,</v>

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you the possibility of </v>

32
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>having a whole bunch of books with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>at once on this little device.</v>

33
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So for that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very handy.</v>

34
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.533
<v Speaker 1>Those are the pluses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think that it's going to </v>

35
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>increase rating because you can acquire </v>
<v Speaker 1>about very quickly,</v>

36
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to wait.</v>

37
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>If you could just push the button and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

38
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>If you really like it and want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

39
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:31.704
<v Speaker 1>you may then go get a paper version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does remove the element of </v>

40
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:36.684
<v Speaker 1>serendipity w by which I mean you walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a bookstore with the idea of </v>

41
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:41.694
<v Speaker 1>getting this book and just say three or </v>
<v Speaker 1>four other books that you really feel </v>

42
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.494
<v Speaker 1>you must have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't have known about them </v>

43
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 1>unless you went into the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how to,</v>

44
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>how to create and an e version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience of serendipity,</v>

45
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard.</v>

46
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>So people are thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>

47
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>The other virtue of the ereader may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

48
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's helpful for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 1>kids are having reading problems because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can isolate blocks of text and make</v>

50
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>the letters bigger.</v>
