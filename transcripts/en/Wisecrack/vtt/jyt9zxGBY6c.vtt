00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Hey everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared,</v>

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.173
<v Speaker 1>I possibly rl here and today we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning the nature of our reality </v>

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.703
<v Speaker 1>season two of westworld premiere this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week and it got some pretty mixed </v>

4
00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.244
<v Speaker 1>reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully it's just setting the </v>

5
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.314
<v Speaker 1>stage for great stuff to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to talk about the biggest </v>

6
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.704
<v Speaker 1>question the premiere raises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any difference between humans </v>

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.663
<v Speaker 1>and flesh box?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest clue I'm going to argue </v>

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.633
<v Speaker 1>is right here in the intro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wisecrack quick take on </v>

9
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>season two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode one of Westworld and spoilage.</v>

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.783
<v Speaker 1>First a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the aftermath of Ford's ranger over </v>

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>retirement party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Poles and inception and wakes up</v>

12
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>disoriented on a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard joins.</v>

13
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.674
<v Speaker 1>Dalio is head of operations Karl Strand </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they hunt down the rest of the </v>

14
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>malfunctioning hosts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime,</v>

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>we see flashbacks of Bernard weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier trying to survive the parties.</v>

16
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.064
<v Speaker 1>Immediate aftermath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hail Brings Bernard two or secret lab </v>

17
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:54.884
<v Speaker 1>where they Zuckerberg everything by </v>
<v Speaker 1>secretly harvesting the guest personal </v>

18
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.334
<v Speaker 1>information and DNA stubs stranded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard find that all the hosts are </v>

19
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>floating in a body of water that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't exist and Bernard reveals that</v>

20
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>he killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Count.</v>

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.933
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mavis still trying to find her daughter </v>

22
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>and as enlisted the help of this use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>

23
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:17.474
<v Speaker 1>Yet delores and teddy are on a straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>up murder spree and Dolores has a new </v>

24
00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>hobby recycling lines from season one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapid succession.</v>

25
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 2>He's five ft lights just like anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me</v>

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.173
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She suggests they take the fun to the </v>

27
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.034
<v Speaker 1>humans on the mainland and William is </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a grand old time trying not to </v>

28
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>die before we're getting introduced to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mazes.</v>

29
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Much anticipated sequel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door</v>

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 3>have to make it back out the door.</v>

31
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.390
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to keep watching to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out now.</v>

33
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:50.224
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be too important phrases </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should keep in mind as the </v>

34
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:57.331
<v Speaker 1>season progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is free and the second is what</v>

35
00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:58.864
<v Speaker 1>is real,</v>

36
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 3>which is irreplaceable.</v>

37
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since season one,</v>

38
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>westworld has teased the idea that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all that different from the host</v>

39
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.573
<v Speaker 3>humans fancy that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>special about the way we perceive the </v>

40
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:19.521
<v Speaker 3>world and yet we live in newbs as tight </v>
<v Speaker 3>and as close to as the host.</v>

41
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.143
<v Speaker 3>Seldom questioning choices contend for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most part to be told what to do </v>

42
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>

43
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Hosts are guided by their programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty obvious,</v>

44
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.543
<v Speaker 1>but this episode goes to great lengths </v>
<v Speaker 1>to invert our understanding of the </v>

45
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.070
<v Speaker 1>nature of that program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Previously,</v>

46
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>we learned that the host had specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives.</v>

47
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.783
<v Speaker 1>What are your,</v>

48
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I tend to my herd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look after my wife</v>

49
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>and now dolores is asking the park's </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what their drives are.</v>

50
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>What are your drives please?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die.</v>

51
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>The basic survival instinct is likened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the cornerstone</v>

52
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

53
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.053
<v Speaker 2>Cornerstone</v>

54
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.963
<v Speaker 1>or the foundational memories that define</v>
<v Speaker 1>hosts like mave or Bernard backstories </v>

55
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>do more than amuse guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They anchor the host.</v>

56
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's their cornerstone just as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hosts,</v>

57
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:13.684
<v Speaker 1>our program with certain instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so too are the humans evolutionarily </v>

58
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>program to pursue survival above all </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

59
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
<v Speaker 1>This idea that humans are primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>guided by their survival instinct is </v>

60
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>really driven home by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition.</v>

61
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte Hale tells Bernard hosts only </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what they're programmed to do.</v>

62
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.283
<v Speaker 1>They do with their program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and immediately a delose board member </v>

63
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>runs for what he thinks will save his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

64
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Some lab techs with the vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it was a trap.</v>

65
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.823
<v Speaker 1>The host took advantage of the guest </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic survival instincts or to put </v>

66
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>another way they're programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

67
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>so humans don't like to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly,</v>

68
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.644
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a machine one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's with mave that things get </v>

69
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

70
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's one of the few hosts who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually seen her programming.</v>

71
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knows someone manipulated her code,</v>

72
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>so she would escape the park and recruit</v>
<v Speaker 1>her fellow hosts,</v>

73
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.373
<v Speaker 1>but she nonetheless tries to navigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>what free will means when it seems all </v>

74
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>of her choices are predestined at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of season one.</v>

75
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.393
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of paradox in that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>must choose between two things she was </v>

76
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:16.654
<v Speaker 1>programmed to do while on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can escape the park as this </v>

77
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:20.584
<v Speaker 1>mysterious code change wants or to or go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to her fake daughter if it was </v>

78
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:24.994
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous before mave stance on what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>real is made abundantly clear when </v>

79
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>sizemore tells her that her daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't really hers,</v>

80
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.500
<v Speaker 1>it's just a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody we programmed,</v>

81
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>she's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead of rejecting this fiction,</v>

82
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.200
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

83
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 2>what about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dreams,</v>

84
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.930
<v Speaker 2>my thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body?</v>

85
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.540
<v Speaker 2>And they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I took these fingers?</v>

86
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't use them to decorate the walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your outsize personality.</v>

87
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Would that</v>

88
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.893
<v Speaker 1>be real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than getting tripped up about </v>

89
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 1>what is really real may for search her </v>
<v Speaker 1>own reality.</v>

90
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean to embrace </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

91
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.303
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a fiction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Westworld here asserts a radical </v>

92
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.514
<v Speaker 1>skepticism toward what is really real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as far as humanity is </v>

93
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:22.864
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Mavis searching for her </v>

94
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.174
<v Speaker 1>daughter is no accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show is overtly using maternal </v>

95
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>instincts to argue that humans are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>less dictated by code then hosts.</v>

96
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It's why they threw a baby with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother into the new intro for humans.</v>

97
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Maternal care is strongly associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a kind of biological coding.</v>

98
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.943
<v Speaker 1>You and mother's care for their young </v>
<v Speaker 1>and let them live a parasitic existence </v>

99
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>for the next 1825 years of their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their genes tell them to.</v>

100
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And while we see similar behavior in </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

101
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>the same can't be said for other animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>who exhibit different biologically coded</v>

102
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>ways to relate to their young bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned.</v>

103
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>They're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're too weak,</v>

104
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.443
<v Speaker 1>harp seals ditch them after 12 days to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find another mate cuckoos trick other </v>

105
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>animals into doing their dirty work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some spiders just go ahead and let their</v>

106
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:07.484
<v Speaker 1>babies eat them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible] and it's so in </v>

107
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.993
<v Speaker 1>math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is can we really call </v>

108
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>naves relationship to her daughter fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we as humans are reared by an adult</v>

109
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:19.184
<v Speaker 1>woman because her genes tell her to </v>
<v Speaker 1>coddle us instead of dumbass onto the </v>

110
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>neighbor's lawn and that's the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the boy Ford's words.</v>

111
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.863
<v Speaker 1>Everything in here is code William,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the host and it's human guests are </v>

112
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>bounded by their programming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be genetic or artificial into</v>

113
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>further muddy the waters of this real </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus fake distinction.</v>

114
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.893
<v Speaker 1>Let's turn back to burn Arnold's words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what is real is what is </v>

115
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>irreplaceable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>

116
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:45.254
<v Speaker 1>then Arnold's not real because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced by Bernard and there's a whole </v>

117
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>room full of Bernard's we've seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this trailer.</v>

118
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>And if Arnold can get replaced by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>host,</v>

119
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 1>can we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one more phrase,</v>

120
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:56.230
<v Speaker 1>all motors</v>

121
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.063
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

122
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Now there's one more thing on my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Bernard taps into the Mesh Network,</v>

123
00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:04.404
<v Speaker 1>he troubleshoots his own malfunction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get a list of everything wrong with </v>

124
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lapse in time.</v>

125
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.623
<v Speaker 1>And this big word prosopagnosia turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>out this means face blindness and could </v>

126
00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:18.180
<v Speaker 1>potentially explain why the hell burn </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists fixated on this corpse.</v>

127
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.223
<v Speaker 1>But to hear more about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with a deep dive into what is </v>
