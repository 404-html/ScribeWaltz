00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

3
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>from New York named Jozy Altidore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he plays on the Olympic team,</v>

4
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>plays for a full national team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:18.454
<v Speaker 1>he's a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone up against them a few times </v>

6
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:21.064
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>he's young in his decision making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

8
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see all the tools are there.</v>

9
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very humble.</v>

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>He's very willing to take advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to learn.</v>

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I think he's definitely a kid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

12
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Most people in soccer circles do know </v>
<v Speaker 1>who he is.</v>

13
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>So for all those people that maybe are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the fringes,</v>

14
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.283
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely a kid to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freddy Adu has been a guy who's been </v>

15
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>well documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>he left the league last year to join one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the top clubs in Portugal and I think</v>

17
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>it's been a great move for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't been playing a lot,</v>

18
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.323
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I couldn't think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything better because now he's got to </v>

19
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>earn it.</v>

20
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>He's in an environment where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care if he's already or do or not.</v>

21
00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>They see 20 freddy a dues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably have 20,</v>

23
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>30 dudes on their team or they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars and now he's going to have to make</v>

24
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>the adjustment where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the number one guy and there's not </v>

26
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>everybody telling him he's the best day </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and day out and so he doesn't have to</v>

27
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>work for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm excited for him.</v>

28
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:13.534
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>during this they just had the Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualifying tournament,</v>

30
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>where are our boys qualified for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics?</v>

31
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And I thought he played very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

32
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another two kids,</v>

33
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 1>one's named Marissa do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he plays up in Toronto,</v>

34
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>went to Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was rookie of the year last year.</v>

35
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>He's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of the tools.</v>

36
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy's a deer.</v>

37
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 1>We can be running whatever distance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the guy sweats,</v>

38
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

39
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that's fair really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he is a specimen.</v>

40
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>He's got a very good soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he needs another guy's very humble.</v>

41
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets it.</v>

42
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gonna be a very important </v>

44
00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>part of our net full national team for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

45
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.860
<v Speaker 1>And then we have another kid named Sasha</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

46
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>He played for Chivas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>grew up in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.463
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that comes out on the field and I </v>

49
00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>think that kind of blend of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical,</v>

50
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but also having a little bit of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>flare a lends itself to our program very</v>

51
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>well because I think that having those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of kids,</v>

52
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>those are few and far between.</v>
