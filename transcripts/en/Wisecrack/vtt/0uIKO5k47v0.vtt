1
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.963
<v Speaker 1>The thriller joy has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has some sort of a connection to just </v>

2
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>the idea of accomplishing something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is set out to do and on Wall Street that</v>

3
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:20.324
<v Speaker 1>happens to be a big trade or a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be creating a beautiful </v>

4
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>painting if you're an artist or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lovely ceramic,</v>

5
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>that kind of an artist or a sculptor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Wall Street,</v>

8
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:34.364
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the measure of sort of accomplishment </v>

9
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>and achievement aside from the bonus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that is attached to it is,</v>

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>is all of those little transactions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen along the way.</v>

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a real connection of I'm </v>

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>talking to a client discussing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular trade or a particular type of</v>

13
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>transaction that they should do going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth on meetings,</v>

14
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>going back and forth on phone calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back and forth on numbers.</v>

15
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>And then like coming out of that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving this goal of,</v>

16
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.243
<v Speaker 1>of closing that deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's also a lot of </v>

17
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.014
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when one team from one company is </v>

18
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:16.631
<v Speaker 1>trying to like a Morgan Stanley or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs or jp Morgan is talking to</v>

19
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a coca cola or an alcove or,</v>

20
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's competing.</v>

21
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Goldman is the only </v>

22
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>company talking to say Coca Cola or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever on,</v>

23
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>on any given day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

24
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of teams and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of competition.</v>

25
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>So what comes out of that for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved is,</v>

26
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:37.884
<v Speaker 1>is the idea of having some help </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish the deal and sort of beaten </v>

27
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>out of the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all very,</v>

28
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's such a very hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive environment.</v>

29
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And some people really continue to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrill out of that forever,</v>

30
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.103
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or throughout their full careers and </v>

31
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>stay for a long time ago up a high chain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep going.</v>

32
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And some people didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was one of them think that's,</v>

33
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also quite empty because you're not </v>

34
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:00.134
<v Speaker 1>actually creating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're accomplishing a close of a deal </v>

35
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:04.574
<v Speaker 1>perhaps what you're not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating anything real or contributing </v>

36
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>anything real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and there's a real emptiness to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

38
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

39
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it goes both ways depending on really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the person.</v>
