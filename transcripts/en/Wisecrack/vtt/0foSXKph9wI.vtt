1
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's indivisible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surely die,</v>

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>then you've got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you have.</v>

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And every diminution of freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech diminishes everyone and,</v>

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessens the currency of freedom of </v>

5
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I feel nothing better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice when it's done lightly.</v>

7
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a controversial statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be earned.</v>

8
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be tossed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to,</v>

9
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back it up.</v>

10
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.980
<v Speaker 1>And so I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

11
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I would urge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>civilized standards of moderation on </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>

13
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.223
<v Speaker 1>It has to be understood that freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech isn't justice at a decadent </v>

14
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.523
<v Speaker 1>frippery that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we gather around us like all our </v>

15
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:01.444
<v Speaker 1>other comforts and privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democracy can't work without freedom of </v>

16
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:06.544
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute cornerstone of </v>

17
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:09.454
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to be very responsible about </v>

18
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>this freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no giving it up.</v>

19
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modifying it.</v>

20
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Eaton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a,</v>

21
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>it's an offshoot of what solidified on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political correctness.</v>

22
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever says I will.</v>

24
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm very politically politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

25
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>but in fact it's good that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the outer fringe pc,</v>

27
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>that and raising the standards about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be said and,</v>

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.383
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exclusion was things you could have </v>

29
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:51.064
<v Speaker 1>said and got away with it a 10 or 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and now seems discordant and </v>

30
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to go back to being opposed to</v>

31
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.073
<v Speaker 1>the ease with which that became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodoxy was I thought tremendously </v>

33
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that Donald Trump has cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the shackles and we go back to being</v>

35
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>brutes again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a terrible prospects pc.</v>

37
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:32.101
<v Speaker 1>His has been an agent for certain sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of evolutionary acceleration,</v>

38
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

39
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>towards progressive ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't.</v>

40
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's been very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:48.610
<v Speaker 1>when I look back at my very early </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction of 40 odd years ago,</v>

42
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shocked and made uneasy by some of </v>

43
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 1>the liberties I took that I have set and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't take no.</v>

44
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

45
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't interfere with the freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

46
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.603
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you challenges every now and </v>

47
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have to sort of work grounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>

48
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but I never resent that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>

49
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.393
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>self improvement on a general scale that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all responded to.</v>
