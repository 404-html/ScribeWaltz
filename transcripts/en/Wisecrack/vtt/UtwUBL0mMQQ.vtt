00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>crack jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to do something a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>risky,</v>

4
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:07.944
<v Speaker 1>a little crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even a little sack religious </v>

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.963
<v Speaker 1>weren't criticizing Pixel because even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's brought us the tear jerking </v>

6
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>joys of inside out wally and the toy </v>
<v Speaker 1>story saga,</v>

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>it's genius is not entirely above some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sloppy storytelling.</v>

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Turns out no studio can resist the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allure of a cash grab,</v>

9
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:26.494
<v Speaker 1>grabby sequel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of what 2016 finding </v>

10
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.364
<v Speaker 1>dory felt like to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't seem as emotionally </v>

11
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:32.694
<v Speaker 1>resident as pixars best work and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>the obsessive nerds that we are here at </v>

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.073
<v Speaker 1>wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to ask ourselves why it's worth </v>

13
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>mentioning here that according to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian,</v>

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.953
<v Speaker 1>finding dory underwent massive rewrites </v>
<v Speaker 1>where those rewrites to blame for our </v>

15
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction with the movie is </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding glory,</v>

16
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>a lesser film than finding Nemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this simply a case of sql lightest or</v>

17
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>we just overfish stories?</v>

18
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's lay this thing and find out.</v>

19
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to wise crack addiction on </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding dory.</v>

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

21
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we dive in,</v>

22
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.583
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the team at lastpass who </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped make this video possible like </v>

23
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:07.584
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably tempted to use the same </v>

24
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:09.354
<v Speaker 1>cube passwords over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean seriously coming up with hard to </v>

25
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>crack passwords and remembering where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've used them.</v>

26
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.054
<v Speaker 1>It's just a pain using the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>passwords again and again is a pretty </v>

27
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sites like Tumblr,</v>

28
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Domino's had been hacked before and</v>

29
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>with a constant flow of new data </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaches,</v>

30
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.163
<v Speaker 1>it's nearly impossible to keep track of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which hacked site could be jeopardizing </v>

31
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>your online security.</v>

43
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.123
<v Speaker 1>it's just a couple bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to lastpass for sponsoring this </v>

44
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:02.214
<v Speaker 1>video and check them out in the link in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the description to get started and now </v>

45
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.784
<v Speaker 1>on with the show finding dory comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>short and at least four key areas we're </v>

46
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>finding nemo excels for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity,</v>

47
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>let's categorize these problems as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>clouded emotional investment too.</v>

48
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Shaky narrative structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

49
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>passive heroism and for purposeless </v>
<v Speaker 1>entourage.</v>

50
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.713
<v Speaker 1>To be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues are almost impossible to </v>

51
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:27.504
<v Speaker 1>separate from one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there will inevitably be some </v>

52
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we go anyway.</v>

53
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of emotional investment,</v>

54
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.003
<v Speaker 1>a key objective of any screenplay is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the audience to care deeply about </v>

55
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:38.754
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal that's often achieved by first </v>

56
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:41.394
<v Speaker 1>getting us to care about whatever our </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist most values and slash or </v>

57
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.114
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the protagonist is focused on </v>

58
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.394
<v Speaker 1>scoring and internship or going the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance in the boxing ring or on </v>

59
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.294
<v Speaker 1>breaking free of a suffocating life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the case in most strong </v>

60
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>screenplays that desire is established </v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

61
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it's singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's powerful,</v>

62
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>and it generates our empathy in finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>nemo and finding dory.</v>

63
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>The protagonist's goals are blatantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar in the first film,</v>

64
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Marlin searches for his kidnap son in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second door.</v>

65
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>He searches for the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hazely remembers,</v>

66
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.803
<v Speaker 1>although there's nothing wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning on the trope of the missing </v>

67
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>family member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it works for Liam Neeson.</v>

68
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.543
<v Speaker 1>Finding Nemo and finding dory </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately have different attitudes </v>

69
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.144
<v Speaker 1>toward the magnitude of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because only one of these films </v>

70
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:28.804
<v Speaker 1>offers us a baseline before it rips a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved one away and it's that baseline </v>

71
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>that creates emotional connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between us,</v>

72
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist and the protagonists </v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

73
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.223
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the bulk of finding Nemo </v>

74
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:40.444
<v Speaker 1>keeps Marlin and Nemo apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it first offers a sense of what these </v>

75
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.614
<v Speaker 1>family members mean to one another as </v>
<v Speaker 1>early as the first minute of finding </v>

76
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Nemo Porch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold what?</v>

77
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Marlin values more than anything else in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

78
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>These are our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about thinking they're the</v>

79
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:54.454
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Marlin proves that value system </v>

80
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>through his actions in the films </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseline moments.</v>

81
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>We see Marlin pledged to protect his </v>
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

82
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>then tease his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then prepare his son for school,</v>

83
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>then bring his son to school and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture his son.</v>

84
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>You're about to swim in open water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a sense of history,</v>

85
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>so when Mimo gets kidnapped 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the film,</v>

86
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>we like Marlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have loved and we have lost.</v>

87
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.363
<v Speaker 1>We are infested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding Dory offers no such baseline so </v>

88
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>it never offers the Gut Punch delivered </v>
<v Speaker 1>by its predecessor.</v>

89
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.773
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dory loses her parents within the first </v>

90
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>five minutes of finding dory in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening scene of the film,</v>

91
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Dory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to her own parents is positioned as</v>

92
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>something of a liability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cute little goof.</v>

93
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetheart.</v>

94
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>What about that rhyme?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learn,</v>

95
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>we see the undertow and we say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

96
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.580
<v Speaker 1>surely thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bubbles in the bath tub.</v>

97
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.433
<v Speaker 1>Her parents vanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much can we really be expected to </v>

98
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>pour our emotions into losing characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never knew?</v>

99
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Where are your parents?</v>

100
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>If finding dory can't get much mileage </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the parent child bond,</v>

101
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>that energized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding Nemo.</v>

102
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Then what is the central relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

103
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.243
<v Speaker 1>Where do we invest our empathy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might guess that we feed into the </v>

104
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>bond between Marlin and Dory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

105
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>they did spend a whole movie together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably totally buds now,</v>

106
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what you can do.</v>

107
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.683
<v Speaker 1>You can go wait over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right over there and forgot to do </v>

108
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

109
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.153
<v Speaker 1>Seems the arc of personal growth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marlin and Dory experienced in finding </v>

110
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:28.204
<v Speaker 1>nemo has reverted here with Dory now </v>
<v Speaker 1>being viewed as a nuisance by pretty </v>

111
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>much everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

112
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:34.594
<v Speaker 1>it isn't until dory is separated from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationships she formed in the </v>

113
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.224
<v Speaker 1>first film that were introduced to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to be her source of support </v>

114
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>in this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bond between Dory and Hank,</v>

115
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.533
<v Speaker 1>a curmudgeonly octopus who wants only to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploit dory for the transport tag </v>

116
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>attached to her fit.</v>

117
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

118
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I just take your bag,</v>

119
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I can take your place on the transport </v>
<v Speaker 1>truck and yeah,</v>

120
00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the nature of their friendship.</v>

121
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Heartwarming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>The emotionally deficient relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between hank and dory is almost entirely</v>

123
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.854
<v Speaker 1>transactional and deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doubles down on the films empathy </v>

124
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.964
<v Speaker 1>gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But later finding dory hastily tries to </v>

125
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>switch gears and that brings us to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>second point,</v>

126
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.813
<v Speaker 1>shaky narrative structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at most memorable films and </v>

127
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:20.594
<v Speaker 1>you'll find the protagonist making a key</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision right at the center of the </v>

128
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.434
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moment that reframes the </v>

129
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:26.594
<v Speaker 1>protagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectives and tests his or her resolve </v>

130
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.863
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Refer to this as the film's midpoint </v>

131
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.143
<v Speaker 1>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence that the halfway </v>

132
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>mark is often a major moment of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection for the protagonists,</v>

133
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.653
<v Speaker 1>a turning point in his or her journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens halfway through finding </v>

134
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>dory?</v>

135
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hank reveals he's got a soft spot for </v>

136
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that loopy bluefish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll forgive me in a heartbeat.</v>

137
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:53.681
<v Speaker 1>Kid 300 new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where did this sentiment come from?</v>

138
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.953
<v Speaker 1>It's surely not earned by any particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions or moments in the film itself </v>

139
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>because hanging dory are never really a </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

140
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.583
<v Speaker 1>And unlike Dorian Marlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're never really shown enjoying </v>

141
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>their adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hey,</v>

142
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 1>come to think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hank isn't even the protagonist here.</v>

143
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.790
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Dorian,</v>

144
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.633
<v Speaker 1>hank have almost no moments of genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection within the first half of </v>

145
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 1>finding dory hanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change of heart towards Dory,</v>

146
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>midway through the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't help but feel unearned.</v>

147
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contrast this with the realization </v>

148
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:26.654
<v Speaker 1>Marlin experiences in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding nema and maybe wouldn't have </v>

149
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>done it if I hadn't been so tough on him</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

150
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Marlin begins to recognize the error of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his overprotective parenting style,</v>

151
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and this realization is a direct result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his control freak behavior,</v>

152
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>nearly getting dory killed throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding Nemo.</v>

153
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>This midpoint shifts and other character</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing moments are directly motivated</v>

154
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.294
<v Speaker 1>by cause and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mimo is motivated to put his life in </v>

155
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy because he learns his dad is </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic.</v>

156
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Ua Dad's been fighting the entire ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking for you.</v>

157
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Marlin is motivated to team with Dory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he realizes dory can read.</v>

158
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>You can read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can read later.</v>

159
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:04.724
<v Speaker 1>Marlin is motivated to separate himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Dory because he thinks his son is </v>

160
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>dead in finding dory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

161
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>key moments in the story like hanks </v>
<v Speaker 1>change of heart towards dory are largely</v>

162
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>motivated by convenience and necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are simply what needs to happen to</v>

163
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>move characters from point a to point b </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

164
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:23.444
<v Speaker 1>Dory refers the hank as sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though evidence of any such </v>

165
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>sweetness is scarce at best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

166
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.653
<v Speaker 1>in this movie being an acid pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily forgiven as long as you pay lip </v>

167
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>service to some sort of growth deep into</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding dory.</v>

168
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Marlin tells story for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I've met you,</v>

169
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you show me how to do stuff I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamed of doing crazy thing,</v>

170
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.893
<v Speaker 1>but even this sentiment to seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>unearned because it leverages moments </v>

171
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:52.154
<v Speaker 1>from the first fill in which Dorian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marlin adventured and grew closer </v>

172
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.823
<v Speaker 1>together rather than from this sequel in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they are either separated from </v>

173
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>each other or annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

174
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.123
<v Speaker 1>this moment is meant to play as a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of self awareness and maturity from </v>

175
00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Marlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which raises the question,</v>

176
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>what is doerries key moment of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness in finding dory?</v>

177
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.390
<v Speaker 2>You are remembered in your own amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dory way.</v>

178
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.453
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to wait until the movie is </v>

179
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.580
<v Speaker 1>nearly over to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this illustrates,</v>

180
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.550
<v Speaker 1>finding doerries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Setback,</v>

181
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 1>passive heroism for much of the film's </v>
<v Speaker 1>running time.</v>

182
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.753
<v Speaker 1>Dori operates as a passive protagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one who responds to events rather than </v>

183
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:31.674
<v Speaker 1>create opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some have this tendency is due to we're </v>

184
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:34.764
<v Speaker 1>all too convenient memory flashes which </v>
<v Speaker 1>handily take the story wherever the </v>

185
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:39.534
<v Speaker 1>screenwriters needed to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These flashes and even the occasional </v>

186
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:43.254
<v Speaker 1>undertow are driven more by chance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proximity then as a result of personal </v>

187
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 1>effort or growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although sometimes it's almost as if the</v>

188
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>film is suggesting doerries disability </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be willed away.</v>

189
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I remembered something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This perspective seems fishy at best and</v>

190
00:09:58.861 --> 00:09:59.694
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't leave Dory with many </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to demonstrate her </v>

191
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:03.174
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity and develop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Events often happened to dory rather </v>

192
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:07.434
<v Speaker 1>than because of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's never a recipe for great </v>

193
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

194
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:12.174
<v Speaker 1>a another cause of Doris passivity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the films actual </v>

195
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.014
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

196
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>After the films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first 20 minutes,</v>

197
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 1>dory quite literally becomes a fish out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of water,</v>

198
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>a status which restricts her movements </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the whims of other characters.</v>

199
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>How much can we expect our protagonists </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the master of her own fate,</v>

200
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 1>which is being carried around in coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>pots,</v>

201
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 1>baby buggies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a bucket that's labeled destiny.</v>

202
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.603
<v Speaker 1>By trading the thrilling blue ocean of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first film to the claustrophobic </v>

203
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 1>human centric clinical spaces of finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>dory.</v>

204
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.103
<v Speaker 1>Pixar ultimately hamstrings the scope of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story it's able to tell and the </v>

205
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>degree to which as protagonists can help</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell it.</v>

206
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Dory then isn't a driver of her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

207
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.853
<v Speaker 1>She's a passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a passive responder to triggered </v>

208
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>memories and odd partnership and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>often blind luck,</v>

209
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 1>but at least her personal motivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>remains relatively clear.</v>

210
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you know anyone who lost a kid a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago?</v>

211
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.660
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't be me.</v>

212
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.583
<v Speaker 1>She wants to find her parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if we're willing to buy into the </v>

213
00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:14.590
<v Speaker 1>premise of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must simply want to find them too.</v>

214
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Even though doerries desire to see her </v>
<v Speaker 1>family is very conveniently triggered by</v>

215
00:11:18.701 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the school of fish saying the word</v>

216
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

217
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.423
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true that doerries ultimate </v>

218
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:25.614
<v Speaker 1>objective is never in doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same can't always be said for </v>

219
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:29.484
<v Speaker 1>Marlin in this film and it's even less </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear for Nimo who at this point seems </v>

220
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.613
<v Speaker 1>in desperate need of child protective </v>
<v Speaker 1>services and this leads us to the </v>

221
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 1>purposeless entourage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

222
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 1>pause here to ask a simple but important</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

223
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Why does finding dory involve all three </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these fish and does nemos involvement</v>

224
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>actually negatively impact our feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Dorian Marlin?</v>

225
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.663
<v Speaker 1>That's Marlin having just a year earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the perilous ocean to save his </v>

226
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.144
<v Speaker 1>only surviving child now agrees to drag </v>
<v Speaker 1>that same child with him to guide dory </v>

227
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>all the way across the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

228
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>simply because how can you be talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the view?</v>

229
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And I remembered my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

230
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this springs from the studios need </v>

231
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>for a sequel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from clear character behavior.</v>

232
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.993
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding dory commits the sin of asking </v>

233
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Marlin and Emo to undermine so much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what made finding nemo powerful.</v>

234
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:23.883
<v Speaker 1>After all the emotional investment we as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an audience made in Nemos recovery and </v>

235
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.354
<v Speaker 1>finding Nemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding Dory asks us to believe that </v>

236
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Marlin responsible father extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>is willing to risk his own son's life.</v>

237
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:40.141
<v Speaker 1>On the basis of Doris Hunch about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents she hasn't seen in years and no,</v>

238
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being hyperbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mimo really seriously almost dies.</v>

239
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't Marlin just find a babysitter?</v>

240
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Why is Nimo part of this new adventure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does Dory,</v>

241
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 1>who presumably cares about Nimo safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed to pull them along on a dangerous</v>

242
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>mission to serve her own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda?</v>

243
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 1>The film mostly bypasses these questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we are to enjoy it,</v>

244
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.583
<v Speaker 1>so most wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should all take a moment here to </v>

245
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:05.464
<v Speaker 1>at least recognize the weirdness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending a fish movie with a car chase on </v>

246
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:09.964
<v Speaker 1>the freeway and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that door is a passenger again </v>

247
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.583
<v Speaker 1>in her own movie.</v>
