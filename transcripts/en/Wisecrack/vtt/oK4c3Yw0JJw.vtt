<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>watches in sunglasses,</v>

2
00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.490
<v Speaker 1>more on movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of this video,</v>

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.170
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.003
<v Speaker 1>for one disembodied jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to talk to you about the Merc with </v>

5
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:12.221
<v Speaker 1>a mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

6
00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:13.054
<v Speaker 1>deadpool probably means a lot to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sharp wit is a welcome reprieve </v>

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.003
<v Speaker 1>from a torrent of superhero movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's getting hurt and we're sure </v>

8
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:25.054
<v Speaker 1>dead pool two will be no different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here to talk about something </v>

9
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only,</v>

10
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>as we've mentioned previously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dead pull a kind of microcosm for the</v>

11
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>ironic distance that pervades our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

12
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.253
<v Speaker 1>but it represents a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does deadpool hold the secret to how </v>

13
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>people can get you to buy more stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this Blob,</v>

14
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.191
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

15
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no spoilers ahead this time.</v>

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.513
<v Speaker 1>Can we say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's begin our story with the most </v>

17
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>recent adverts for deadpool two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teaser at the beginning of Logan and</v>

18
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>the wet on wet trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of these succeed free,</v>

19
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>very simple reason.</v>

20
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.863
<v Speaker 1>They actively refuse to do what normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotional material should do in the </v>

21
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:00.304
<v Speaker 1>Logan teaser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool takes too long changing in a </v>

22
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>phone booth while a hapless civilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets brutally assaulted.</v>

23
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's too late,</v>

24
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.573
<v Speaker 1>but being honest with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have just called nine </v>

25
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:09.694
<v Speaker 1>one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing pokes fun at one of our </v>

26
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oldest icons,</v>

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.233
<v Speaker 1>superman and for good measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a random essay about the old man in the </v>

28
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still scratching our heads at that</v>

29
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:18.904
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it has something to do with Logan </v>

30
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and Santiago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial nature.</v>

31
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the trailer,</v>

32
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.244
<v Speaker 1>wet on wet deadpool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don's a sweet fro in a soothing </v>

33
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Baritone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating Bob Ross's the joy of painting</v>

34
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>even before Deadpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cultural obsession with Bob Ross has</v>

35
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>always included a little dose of irony </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you tell them,</v>

36
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bushes there,</v>

37
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I will come to your house and I will cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

38
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 1>The wholesome public television show </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of dad humor and happy little trees</v>

39
00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>became an internet sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's naive.</v>

40
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Authenticity became a joke for </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion.</v>

41
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Millennials,</v>

42
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.793
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a very good fisherman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I catch a little fish and take the hook </v>

43
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 2>carefully out of his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put a bandaid on him going the CTR patty</v>

44
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 2>one to two two and putting back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water</v>

45
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>in wet on wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The colors are movie jokes.</v>

46
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Bob Ross's very real obsession with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whacking his brushes is highlighted.</v>

47
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 2>What's that often shake off the excess </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just beat the devil out of.</v>

48
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 2>That's really the most fun part of it</v>

49
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and the chief engineer is one jury La </v>
<v Speaker 1>Forge.</v>

50
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Both of these are awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>When I saw them in theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were losing their shit,</v>

52
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but is there something more to it than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

53
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.253
<v Speaker 1>it's funny if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these promotions are anti promotions by </v>

54
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:32.394
<v Speaker 1>flaunting their absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mostly avoid teasing the actual </v>

55
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>movie they're promoting held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first deadpool movie marketed itself</v>

56
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>as a Romcom at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprise.</v>

57
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>This is actually lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are love story.</v>

58
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Instead of promises of cool fight scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a suspenseful plot.</v>

59
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.633
<v Speaker 1>The whole pre logan trailer just raises </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubts about Super Harrowing in general </v>

60
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>is a phone booth doing on a street </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner and wet on wet has a real trailer</v>

61
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:56.874
<v Speaker 1>packed on the end of a series of not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle in you with no relation to the </v>

62
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:01.174
<v Speaker 1>movie itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just get high and all laughs </v>

63
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>splendor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

64
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.704
<v Speaker 1>I love cocaine and here's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secret of self promotion in 2017 is </v>

65
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>to make fun of the very fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>being self promotional.</v>

66
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.513
<v Speaker 4>That's supposed to sell deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about something real like the </v>

67
00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:19.550
<v Speaker 4>smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated center mall spice.</v>

68
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.453
<v Speaker 1>The secret is cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to understand why this is uniquely </v>

69
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:24.054
<v Speaker 1>successful today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to turn back to a guy who lived </v>

70
00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:29.480
<v Speaker 1>in a barrel and made philosophy out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissing in public dialogue.</v>

71
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.333
<v Speaker 1>He needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cynic was one of the progenitors of </v>

72
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:32.424
<v Speaker 1>Western cynical philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disputed whether or not he's the </v>

73
00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>reason we use the term cynicism to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe his school philosophy,</v>

74
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>but the term cynic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in Greek means dog,</v>

75
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 1>like what's at the very least an insult </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurled.</v>

76
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>At diageo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's by his contemporaries,</v>

77
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.433
<v Speaker 1>but either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really embraced the term and made a </v>

78
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:48.864
<v Speaker 1>habit of urinating and fornicating in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public just like our four legged </v>

79
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:54.330
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never one to half ass anything.</v>

80
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Even tried eating raw meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unlike our foul mouth.</v>

81
00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:58.734
<v Speaker 1>Tiro Dodge and he spent his time </v>
<v Speaker 1>berating the customs and habits of his </v>

82
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:02.514
<v Speaker 1>peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas dead pool may successfully type </v>

83
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.370
<v Speaker 1>cast his peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

84
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:06.204
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll leave me all alone here with less </v>

85
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>angry rosie o'donnell.</v>

86
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.760
<v Speaker 1>They are genies would do things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop on Plato's carpet yelling.</v>

87
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.683
<v Speaker 1>I trample on the pride of plato running </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Plato's classroom with a plump </v>

88
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:19.644
<v Speaker 1>chicken screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold Plato's man and ordering his </v>

89
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:22.974
<v Speaker 1>remains three thrown over the city wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that wild animals could feast on his </v>

90
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.144
<v Speaker 1>corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point for [inaudible] was to be </v>

91
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:29.664
<v Speaker 1>relentlessly cynical toward the habit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and customs of the well to do with </v>

92
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Finian's if they viewed themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>noble purveyors.</v>

93
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Of Truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dow Ginny's would carry around a lantern</v>

94
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 1>in broad daylight telling those around </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

95
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:41.064
<v Speaker 1>He was searching for an honest man if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought defecating in public was </v>

96
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:45.174
<v Speaker 1>beneath the dignity of a civilized man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>die jays would drop trau right in the </v>

97
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.584
<v Speaker 1>middle of the [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an entirely different than </v>

98
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 1>these superhero that refuses to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

99
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Cherry Garcia ice cream.</v>

100
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 4>I can eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

101
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.983
<v Speaker 1>despite their similarities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadpool and diage needs are </v>

102
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:02.894
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least according to the logic of </v>

103
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Peter slaughter died for </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughter dyke.</v>

104
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.180
<v Speaker 1>If diageo has represented a pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of his contemporaries,</v>

105
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.103
<v Speaker 1>cynicism today has become universal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>diffuse permeating every aspect of our </v>

106
00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:17.750
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>News,</v>

107
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.450
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Video Games are all made cynically,</v>

108
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and we even perform our jobs with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical indifference.</v>

109
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>The logic boils down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

110
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.040
<v Speaker 1>at least it's a paycheck on a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

111
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.053
<v Speaker 1>Slaughter Dyke was writing in the 1980s </v>
<v Speaker 1>but he might as well have been riding </v>

112
00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:32.984
<v Speaker 1>today if diageo needs publicly performed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a way to rid the world of bad </v>

113
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:37.544
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern cynicism is merely a resignation </v>

114
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:41.024
<v Speaker 1>to the fact that everything is terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and while deadpool is perfect proof of </v>

115
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.090
<v Speaker 1>universal cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't actually change anything.</v>

116
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.103
<v Speaker 1>Also consider the steady stream of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware advertising that succeeds by </v>

117
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 1>virtue that it rejects it's berry </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise.</v>

118
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.733
<v Speaker 1>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebron James made a sprite commercial </v>

119
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>for the super bowl where he ironically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and repeatedly affirms the,</v>

120
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>he'll never tell you to drink sprite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get one thing straight.</v>

121
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.133
<v Speaker 1>I'll never tell you to drink sprite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I wasn't a commercial for </v>

122
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>sprite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I am.</v>

123
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>New Castle made a superbowl ad about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't afford a superbowl ad.</v>

124
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.063
<v Speaker 5>Turns out they don't even have the money</v>
<v Speaker 5>or permission to make us more so they </v>

125
00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:21.720
<v Speaker 5>can't even say the word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically,</v>

126
00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:22.554
<v Speaker 5>the only thing I haven't done is a nude </v>
<v Speaker 5>scene and get paid money to be at a </v>

127
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:27.780
<v Speaker 5>commercial for a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even drink</v>

128
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.683
<v Speaker 1>cards against humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made a whole black Friday campaign out </v>

129
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>of mailing people poop and if mailing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people poop is a metaphor for successful</v>

130
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:35.524
<v Speaker 1>marketing in our modern age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool's advertising is the Creme de </v>

131
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>la at her to film promotion.</v>

132
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 5>Hold each of your man berries or as I </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to call them,</v>

133
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:42.824
<v Speaker 5>smooth criminals,</v>

134
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>trailers that aren't trailers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A superhero who is not a hero.</v>

135
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.383
<v Speaker 1>Per Brazil's comicon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool released a video where he </v>

136
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:49.874
<v Speaker 1>offers a supposedly heartfelt attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with his Brazilian fans by </v>

137
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.570
<v Speaker 1>saying the show my dedication to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah</v>

138
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.463
<v Speaker 5>legions of Brazilian deadpool fans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've spent up to 20 minutes on Google </v>

139
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:00.414
<v Speaker 5>translate as well as countless hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching Tele novellas to teach me </v>

140
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 5>everything about your official language</v>

141
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>before offering up eight clearly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadpool,</v>

142
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 1>voiceover</v>

143
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 5>you're goes [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>

144
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.750
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>

145
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps nothing exemplifies this </v>
<v Speaker 1>trend.</v>

146
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.263
<v Speaker 1>Like a recent rick and morty old spice </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Rick Sanchez introduces some </v>

147
00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:23.224
<v Speaker 1>anthropomorphize old spice products in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>board monotone before counting neath </v>

148
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.333
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars he just made for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shameless promotion for slaughter </v>

149
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:30.874
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what separates modern cynicism </v>

150
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:33.274
<v Speaker 1>from the cynicism of Diageo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our modern economy is compatible with </v>

151
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.024
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite so much as the limitations about </v>

152
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>the corrupting effect of all mighty </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

153
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Money makes the world go round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that terrible?</v>

154
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 1>What makes this work for advertising to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

155
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Slaughter dykes words is that cynicism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is criticism with limited liability.</v>

156
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool can joke about the budget </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints of his own movie,</v>

157
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.553
<v Speaker 5>Big House.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny that I only ever see two of </v>

158
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:56.444
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like the studio couldn't </v>

159
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 5>afford another Eczema</v>

160
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 1>or even its own lead.</v>

161
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 5>I think Ryan Reynolds got this far on </v>
<v Speaker 5>his superior acting method</v>

162
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.753
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so protects itself from any</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgements about budget constraints or </v>

163
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:10.690
<v Speaker 1>acting resumes for slaughter died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fundamentally different than the</v>

164
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:11.524
<v Speaker 1>cynicism of diabetes they are needs met </v>
<v Speaker 1>the customs and ideas of his peers with </v>

165
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Speaker 1>pure satirical laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked because he also constructed an</v>

166
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.060
<v Speaker 1>alternative living like a stray dog out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a giant barrel.</v>

167
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 1>In response to the contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions of citizenship,</v>

168
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>he declared he was a citizen of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

169
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.623
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our modern cynicism lacks any </v>

170
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.114
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas some thinkers posited that the </v>

171
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:35.740
<v Speaker 1>masses will follow their leaders with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>false consciousness.</v>

172
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.260
<v Speaker 1>A metaphorical wool pulled over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

173
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Slaughter Dyke posits that modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism is enlightened false </v>

174
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:43.174
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are acutely aware that there is wool </v>

175
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 1>over our eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we safe get wall is warm and cozy.</v>

176
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Creators may know an advertisement is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>

177
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.333
<v Speaker 1>but on a commercial is so annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got a great product or a </v>

178
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>superhero trope is overused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superhero landing,</v>

179
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to do a superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>landing,</v>

180
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta pay the bills,</v>

181
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.824
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

183
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.243
<v Speaker 1>Superhero landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alternative is to make a movie that </v>

184
00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:10.040
<v Speaker 1>no one watches or a youtube video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still hurt about that one.</v>

185
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.140
<v Speaker 6>Yay.</v>

186
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Consider the painting at the end of wet </v>
<v Speaker 1>on wet.</v>

187
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.603
<v Speaker 1>It's an alteration of Norman Rockwell's </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom from want depicting a wholesome </v>

188
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>family ready to eat a giant Merica size </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

189
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>part of his four freedom series based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FDR speech.</v>

190
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>The message was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what makes America great.</v>

191
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 1>The freedom to pray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat a ton of meat,</v>

192
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>to feel safe and to speak your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In typical deadpool fashion,</v>

193
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 1>a wholesome image is robbed of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>original meaning.</v>

194
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 1>This is another microcosm of our cynical</v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

195
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.443
<v Speaker 1>Straightforward defenses of any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>values are scorned as naive at best and </v>

196
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:47.424
<v Speaker 1>at worst are vulnerable to being wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considered the worst advertisement of </v>

197
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>the century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad we're a can of</v>

198
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:54.504
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water brings together protesters and </v>

199
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:56.904
<v Speaker 1>riot cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand we all cringed because </v>

200
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 1>the ad cynically watered down social </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements to sell soda,</v>

201
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 1>but the real mistake was to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything at all,</v>

202
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>even if behind the scenes it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical.</v>

203
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>If the add added a few do not attempt in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real life or results not guaranteed.</v>

204
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.293
<v Speaker 1>We want of all laugh that such a self </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware add cynical advertising upfront </v>

205
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 1>about its own cynicism is smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising.</v>

206
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 1>It's advertising with limited liability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it shouldn't surprise us that figures</v>

207
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:24.174
<v Speaker 1>like superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a symbol of heroism and goodness or </v>

208
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Norman Rockwell's freedom from want draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ire of dead pool slaughtered.</v>

209
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:31.014
<v Speaker 1>I quotes Georg symbol who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more money becomes the sole center </v>

210
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>of interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we see honor and convictions,</v>

211
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:37.614
<v Speaker 1>talent and virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and health of the soul mobilized </v>

212
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:40.884
<v Speaker 1>on monies behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more a mocking and frivolous mood </v>

213
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:43.824
<v Speaker 1>will arise regarding these values which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are offered for sale for the same kind </v>

214
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:47.874
<v Speaker 1>of value as goods on the weekly market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool is the embodiment of this </v>

215
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>frivolous and mocking mood because </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroics and values are for sale.</v>

216
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>How are we not supposed to laugh at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

217
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Please don't make it super suit green or</v>
<v Speaker 4>animated.</v>

218
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.610
<v Speaker 1>And because there exists no conceivable </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to escape the system,</v>

219
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:07.400
<v Speaker 1>we criticize like perhaps diageo needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cynic could.</v>

220
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.720
<v Speaker 1>What else are we to do?</v>

221
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.613
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

222
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.703
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think is cynicism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing the best way to advertise </v>

223
