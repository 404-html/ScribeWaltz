<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.633
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Garrick's where ameloid </v>
<v Speaker 1>this week's artifact is it based on the </v>

7
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>novel by the sovereign of intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

8
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>King Stephen and storing the cutest </v>
<v Speaker 1>scars guardian of the galaxy.</v>

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.453
<v Speaker 1>The film takes place in an alternate </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality where earth children rode bikes </v>

10
00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:41.641
<v Speaker 1>everywhere known as the ats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our sort of protagonist is build in Bro,</v>

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>who despite his name breaks the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule of bro Code.</v>

12
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>When he lets an unemployed artists eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 1>a year passes and bill's still butthurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his dead brother.</v>

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.673
<v Speaker 1>He's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his loser friends search the septic </v>

15
00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:59.800
<v Speaker 1>tank with them only to find it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>barren than my first wife.</v>

16
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.323
<v Speaker 1>A local Hussey named Bev short for </v>
<v Speaker 1>beverage joins the crew to up the </v>

17
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 1>diversity and the boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his blood pressure and a stranger things</v>

18
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>start happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids make a shocking discovery.</v>

19
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>The only haunted looking house in town </v>
<v Speaker 1>is haunted and it's where it lifts.</v>

20
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.113
<v Speaker 1>Turns out the artist is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bogert named pennywise who's preferred </v>

21
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:25.591
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun is it dad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When pennywise totally screws with their</v>

22
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:28.414
<v Speaker 1>analog powerpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids try plan a walk into it's trap </v>

23
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.420
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since Bev probably took all their plan B</v>

24
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>and after successfully stabbing its </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

25
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>they disband for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is until pennywise teen naps Bev to</v>

26
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 1>show her his latest installation bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Co's save her cause they hate modern</v>

27
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:46.864
<v Speaker 1>art and take turns punching it even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though they could have done that at </v>

28
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:50.314
<v Speaker 1>literally any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennywise goes down the pipes back to </v>

29
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:53.614
<v Speaker 1>the mushroom kingdom and the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocking summer ever ends like all </v>

30
00:01:56.561 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>rocking summers with a blood oath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At its core,</v>

31
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it is about battling fear and is not at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about child orgies.</v>

32
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.493
<v Speaker 1>Pennywise lives in the sewers beneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>dairy surface reflecting the </v>

33
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.794
<v Speaker 1>subconscious nature of its attacks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard it is to find a good one </v>

34
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>bedroom fame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychopaths,</v>

35
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.394
<v Speaker 1>siggy fraudster would call this </v>
<v Speaker 1>amalgamation of subconscious concerns </v>

36
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 1>into one representative token </v>
<v Speaker 1>condensation.</v>

37
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I call it Dad Dad.</v>

38
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Ed's fear of disease is baked into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude with Eczema.</v>

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.843
<v Speaker 1>The painting in Stan's father's office </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the pressure on stand to </v>

40
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>learn how to read the Rabbi's son Ken </v>
<v Speaker 1>finishes on Taurine.</v>

41
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.073
<v Speaker 1>The bloody scene in beverages bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects her insecurities about her </v>

42
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>changing body as is quickly losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbonation.</v>

43
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>The film explores the conditions under </v>
<v Speaker 1>which fear and evil may flourish.</v>

44
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Pennywise finds a comfortable home in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dairy because the adults are indifferent</v>

45
00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>to the town's problems like the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder rate,</v>

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>constant amber alerts or the lurking </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer childhood obesity.</v>

47
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.943
<v Speaker 1>By feigning ignorance to these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adults enable it just as they allow </v>

48
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>bullying and racism to do its thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film suggests that being alone </v>

49
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:08.914
<v Speaker 1>renders one more vulnerable to fear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spending an entire day naked on the </v>

50
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>couch throughout the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It attacks victims one on one cause it's</v>

51
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>not really into group stuff.</v>

52
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>The antidote to indifference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation is friendship.</v>

53
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a 64,000</v>

54
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.904
<v Speaker 1>be the losers are only able to defeat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>by facing it together and sharing their </v>

55
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:30.214
<v Speaker 1>emotional burdens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though all they had to do was hit </v>

56
00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>it with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Bev decides to go.</v>

57
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:35.434
<v Speaker 1>All Terri Shiavo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Ben's gesture of friendship that </v>

58
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>snaps her out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A classic true love's first base,</v>

59
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>like many kings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steven ips.</v>

60
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>It is about coming of age to legally </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone.</v>

61
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.673
<v Speaker 1>The film as an allegory for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition from childhood to young </v>

62
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as the hood.</v>

63
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The characters are helpless.</v>

64
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.204
<v Speaker 1>Children controlled by their overbearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and the beliefs who terrorize </v>

65
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trap.</v>

66
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.613
<v Speaker 1>They are painfully aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that make them </v>

67
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Billy,</v>

68
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>it's his oral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hair.</v>

69
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>For Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everything except his personality.</v>

70
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And for Mike it's being the only black </v>
<v Speaker 1>character in the movie.</v>

71
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>But as the children unify and battled </v>
<v Speaker 1>the monster,</v>

72
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>they learn to assert power over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own lives.</v>

73
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Graduating from helpless children to </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpless teens,</v>

74
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>despite its uplifting message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film makes it clear that evil,</v>

75
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>much like herpes can never be eradicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a ray gun,</v>

76
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>just as pennywise will inevitably wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in 27 years.</v>

77
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>This stuff seems to happen every other </v>
<v Speaker 1>27 years.</v>

78
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.263
<v Speaker 1>Evil such as racism and abuse will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually rise up and get a hit movie </v>

79
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it did in the 2075 box office.</v>

80
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Hit racism and abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save Christmas,</v>

81
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>earthlink cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Garrick's learning what goes up.</v>

82
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Must come clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If</v>

83
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.850
<v Speaker 3>there's anything we get asked time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>time again,</v>

84
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.713
<v Speaker 3>it's jared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you still be Gareth's as intern </v>

85
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 3>after all this time and it's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny story.</v>

86
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.563
<v Speaker 3>Late last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Garrick's promoted me to graphic </v>

87
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 3>designer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just white,</v>

88
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 3>having no experience whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attempting to airbrushes eyebrows.</v>

89
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I failed miserably even though I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have used skillshare,</v>

90
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:18.570
<v Speaker 3>the online learning community with </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of classes,</v>

91
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 3>the final product was a nightmare and </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing garrick's you can probably guess</v>

92
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 3>what happened next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fired,</v>

93
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.643
<v Speaker 3>lost my salary and was forced to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the streets and he used Napkins to </v>

94
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is until I got a premium membership</v>

95
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:32.904
<v Speaker 3>on skillshare and unlimited access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>college grade courses on skills that </v>

96
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:36.924
<v Speaker 3>would allow me to get hired back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sent the subscription has less than $10 </v>

97
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:40.704
<v Speaker 3>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took all the courses I would need </v>

98
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.013
<v Speaker 3>dynamic brand identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentals of dslr photography and </v>

99
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 3>mastering logo design.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Armed with all these skills.</v>

100
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I ask Eric for my job back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he overwhelmingly said no.</v>

101
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.240
<v Speaker 3>So I grovel to my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went numb,</v>

102
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 3>and he reluctantly hired me back as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intern.</v>

103
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 3>So don't make the same mistakes I did </v>
