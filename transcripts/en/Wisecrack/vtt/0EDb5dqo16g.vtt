00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
<v Speaker 1>What the word flip flop flopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.353
<v Speaker 1>denotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that people want to be </v>

3
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>elected so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want this power so bad that they'll</v>

4
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:11.994
<v Speaker 1>say anything to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all you gotta do is watch some of </v>

5
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>these politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my God,</v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.531
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

7
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.231
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poops up.</v>

8
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>They're just jumping right across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board and they're all doing it.</v>

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>They're all doing it on the democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.533
<v Speaker 1>I think that there probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a little more consistency </v>

11
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>with Dennis percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got other problems.</v>

12
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's liberal,</v>

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on politics as usual and the liberal </v>

14
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's the best of the bunch.</v>

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on the other side,</v>

16
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>but you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they change.</v>

17
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Now it's very important to realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say this about,</v>

18
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edwards,</v>

19
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edwards voted for the war and I find him</v>

20
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>extremely sincere about the fact of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.543
<v Speaker 1>of w w the mistake he made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I really take his sincerity </v>

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>straightaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That flip floppy,</v>

23
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for me.</v>

24
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.474
<v Speaker 1>Edwards was not flip fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was informed by experience and that </v>

25
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.943
<v Speaker 1>we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the advantage I bring to the </v>

26
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:08.004
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm informed by experience and I've got </v>

27
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot more experienced than all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others put together.</v>
