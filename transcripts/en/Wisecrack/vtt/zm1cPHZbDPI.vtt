00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Stick around at the end of the video to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn more about the game.</v>

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.993
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared here would be imminent release of </v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:11.754
<v Speaker 1>the avengers infinity war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought we'd go back and take a look </v>

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>at the civil war.</v>

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one</v>

8
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.490
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

9
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.323
<v Speaker 1>on its face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war is a two hour spectacle of </v>

10
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:25.054
<v Speaker 1>biceps chases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandatory character introductions to </v>

11
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>feed the mcu and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:30.424
<v Speaker 1>he lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in addition to some good old </v>

13
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:32.794
<v Speaker 1>fashioned fisticuffs civil war also </v>
<v Speaker 1>explores the idea of global fisticuffs </v>

14
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker 1>or international relations as you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.873
<v Speaker 1>Which brings us to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do superpowers like the United </v>

16
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>States have to learn from Tony Stark or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rogers?</v>

17
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.323
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack condition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of Captain America civil </v>

18
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't</v>

19
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:51.274
<v Speaker 1>already and has always spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the civil war comics Uris deals </v>

20
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>with issues like privacy and domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>policing in the wake of the Patriot Act,</v>

21
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>the film makes an ambitious break with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its source material.</v>

22
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.853
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it focuses on a conflict between two </v>

23
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>approaches to international relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war frames.</v>

24
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:08.584
<v Speaker 1>The conflict between Captain America and</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man is a battle between two </v>

25
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>opposing views on the avengers role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

26
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film asks,</v>

27
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.383
<v Speaker 1>should a US based high powered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially destructive team like the </v>

28
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:20.344
<v Speaker 1>avengers be allowed to operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally independent of </v>

29
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>government oversight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a poignant question to ask,</v>

30
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.183
<v Speaker 1>especially in the wake of America's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning of its interventionism </v>

31
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:30.454
<v Speaker 1>abroad in civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This question comes to a head in the </v>

32
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:33.364
<v Speaker 1>debate over the Sokovia accords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The accords claim the avengers have no </v>

33
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>right to cross national borders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

34
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:39.934
<v Speaker 1>They're highly destructive battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the approval of all governments </v>

35
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their argument is grounded in the notion</v>

36
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>of Westphalian sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that a nation state is an ought</v>

37
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>to be in charge of all affairs within </v>
<v Speaker 1>its borders.</v>

38
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.743
<v Speaker 1>This modern notion of sovereignty only </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to exist in 1648 after the major </v>

39
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.094
<v Speaker 1>European powers were tired of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>either the 30 years' war or eight years </v>

40
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which unlike the liar,</v>

41
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>seven years' war actually lasted for as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as advertise the resulting peace of</v>

42
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Westphalia created the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty that we understand today,</v>

43
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>but in our highly globalized modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

44
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.413
<v Speaker 1>things are a little more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than when people were still charging </v>

45
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>into battle on horseback.</v>

46
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.573
<v Speaker 1>Many contemporary political commentators</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all about the idea of a post </v>

47
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:22.444
<v Speaker 1>Westphalian world order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They argued that globalization has </v>

48
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 1>broken down traditional ideas of who </v>
<v Speaker 1>holds power were under this system.</v>

49
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.823
<v Speaker 1>Independent actors such as private </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and terrorist cells are </v>

50
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:33.544
<v Speaker 1>able to wield as much or sometimes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>power than the nation states whose </v>

51
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 1>borders they cross at will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the film,</v>

52
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the avengers are portrayed as a product </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this post Westphalian world.</v>

53
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>There are a group of US based </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhumans who go wherever they want,</v>

54
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.493
<v Speaker 1>whenever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the permission of local </v>

55
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.044
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film even emphasizes this modern </v>

56
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>notion of the avengers in its opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>where our heroes tried to catch a former</v>

57
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:56.104
<v Speaker 1>hydra agent while using the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a police operation complete with drones </v>

58
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and calls for backup</v>

59
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.143
<v Speaker 3>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need fire and rescue and the south </v>

60
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:07.100
<v Speaker 3>side of the building.</v>

61
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.933
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they function less like a traditional </v>

62
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.900
<v Speaker 1>police force and more like a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>security company.</v>

63
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.943
<v Speaker 1>If like main villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zemo your family happens to be the one </v>

64
00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:17.510
<v Speaker 1>that gets blown up in their latest </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt at saving the world,</v>

65
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you might even consider them terrorists.</v>

66
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.513
<v Speaker 3>What would you call a group of us based </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhanced individuals who routinely </v>

67
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:26.634
<v Speaker 3>ignore sovereign borders and inflict </v>
<v Speaker 3>their will wherever they choose and who </v>

68
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.070
<v Speaker 3>frankly seemed unconcerned about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they leave behind.</v>

69
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.023
<v Speaker 1>The sokovia accords then are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westphalian world dealing with post </v>

70
00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.684
<v Speaker 1>Westphalian realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The debate over the accords is grounded </v>

71
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>in two competing views of how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international arena works.</v>

72
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Realism and liberalism realism argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that states are self interested.</v>

73
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:51.384
<v Speaker 1>Power seeking rational actors who seek </v>
<v Speaker 1>to maximize their security and chances </v>

74
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.340
<v Speaker 1>of survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberalism,</v>

75
00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:58.470
<v Speaker 1>stresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interdependence among states,</v>

76
00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.304
<v Speaker 1>multinational corporations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>international institutions arguing that </v>

77
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.144
<v Speaker 1>these various actors can and should work</v>
<v Speaker 1>together for the benefit of all the </v>

78
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Sokovia accords fit this liberalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigm to a tea under the new rule set</v>

79
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>out in the accords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government actors I.</v>

80
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.723
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UN will work together with </v>

81
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 1>nongovernmental forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

82
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:20.580
<v Speaker 1>the avengers for the presumed common </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

83
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.563
<v Speaker 1>This means more rules and greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversight for the avengers who will no </v>

84
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.164
<v Speaker 1>longer be able to gallivant around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>globe fighting whenever and wherever </v>

85
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:29.730
<v Speaker 1>they please compromise</v>

86
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 3>reassurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the world works.</v>

87
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.683
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark buys into the accords </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalist framework but still manages </v>

88
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:38.400
<v Speaker 1>to do plenty of Gallo vantage.</v>

89
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.473
<v Speaker 3>He seriously thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to you after this fiasco and </v>

90
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Leipzig,</v>

91
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.313
<v Speaker 1>you are used that cooperation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign governments even to the point </v>

92
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:46.794
<v Speaker 1>of accepting the imposed limitations is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial for stark respect for the </v>

93
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:51.504
<v Speaker 1>interdependent world order is part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what separates the avengers from the </v>

94
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:55.740
<v Speaker 1>terrorist groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fight.</v>

95
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.430
<v Speaker 3>We need to be put in check whatever form</v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes.</v>

96
00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.264
<v Speaker 3>I'm game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we can't accept limitations were </v>

97
00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:03.680
<v Speaker 3>boundaryless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're no better than the bad guys.</v>

98
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

99
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.124
<v Speaker 1>is a realist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's focused on security and his own </v>

100
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:09.424
<v Speaker 1>agenda first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and argues against the Sokovia cords on </v>

101
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.204
<v Speaker 1>the grounds that they will make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avengers less able to respond to </v>

102
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>critical situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thereby putting the world in danger.</v>

103
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>If we call Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

104
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.713
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe even if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows if the accords or let them </v>

105
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>know we're on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the real,</v>

106
00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:26.174
<v Speaker 1>his position allows for cooperation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will increase the likelihood of the </v>

107
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:29.764
<v Speaker 1>world survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain America is simply unconvinced </v>

108
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that this cooperation will improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>security for anyone.</v>

109
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.853
<v Speaker 1>Steve argues that the shifting agendas </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those who uphold the accords could </v>

110
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>lead to compromise security down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

111
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 3>This is the United Nations we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

112
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not the World Security Council.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not shield.</v>

113
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.434
<v Speaker 3>It's not hydro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's run by people with agendas and </v>

114
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Speaker 3>agendas</v>

115
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.573
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film asked some pretty heavy </v>

116
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 1>questions that may as well be directed </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a modern superpower.</v>

117
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Is unfettered power inherently </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous?</v>

118
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Do rules only tie up crucial fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces in dangerous amounts of red tape?</v>

119
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.373
<v Speaker 1>Instead of providing some black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white answer for an insanely complex </v>

120
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film offers us some ambiguity.</v>

121
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.223
<v Speaker 1>While one may criticize captain America </v>
<v Speaker 1>for his unilateral approach to solving </v>

122
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:12.720
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

123
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.850
<v Speaker 3>stop telling you anything else that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll wrong.</v>

124
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.510
<v Speaker 3>You think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you dangerous.</v>

125
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>You could equally say the same of Tony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stark as he tries to enforce the Sokovia</v>

126
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.904
<v Speaker 1>accords leading to plenty of collateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage along the way while exploring </v>

127
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.254
<v Speaker 1>these international frameworks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film also explores how personal </v>

128
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>ethics can complicate these concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a terrorist blows up the UN killing</v>

129
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>black panthers father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes on the hunt for presumed culprit</v>

130
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.144
<v Speaker 1>bucky barnes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attack on the UN creates a riff </v>

131
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:40.754
<v Speaker 1>between those vendors who want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to take in bucky and those </v>

132
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:43.814
<v Speaker 1>who believed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain America's right to attempt his </v>

133
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>own rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where this conflict,</v>

134
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:47.834
<v Speaker 1>the film asks us to consider whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to act based on a </v>

135
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:50.834
<v Speaker 1>preconceived set of moral obligations </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the captain's obligation to Bucky </v>

136
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.490
<v Speaker 1>or with consideration for the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>good like stark and his compatriots,</v>

137
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark in his gang and body branch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of philosophy known as Utilitarianism,</v>

138
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.463
<v Speaker 1>which holds that actions should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>judged based on their overall </v>

139
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>consequences rather than on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>adherence to abstract ideals.</v>

140
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.613
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark believes that oversight will </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce the amount of collateral damage </v>

141
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.064
<v Speaker 1>caused by their activities and that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is reason enough to support the Sokovia </v>

142
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:16.934
<v Speaker 1>courts above and beyond his belief in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the usefulness of a liberalist world </v>

143
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:20.414
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark's supports the accords </v>

144
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>because they align with his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian conception of morality.</v>

145
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>These two ideas are different though not</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily contradictory.</v>

146
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>While he knows that the new rules will </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconvenience him and his team,</v>

147
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>he's convinced that they will improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lot of humanity as a whole.</v>

148
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not about his personal convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about the greater good.</v>

149
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.913
<v Speaker 3>Captain Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you believe what you're doing is </v>

150
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:47.220
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the collective good,</v>

151
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.470
<v Speaker 3>you must surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

152
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Captain America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

153
00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>flirts with an ethical position known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>deontology.</v>

154
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.903
<v Speaker 1>Deontology judges the morality of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>action itself without consideration for </v>

155
00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>the affects that said action might have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

156
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>not contradictory to his real as </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

157
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but different nonetheless from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deontological perspective,</v>

158
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.233
<v Speaker 1>certain actions can never be justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much they might promote </v>

159
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 1>some greater good like killing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent person,</v>

160
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.253
<v Speaker 1>even if it could save millions more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Steve Rogers isn't they perfect </v>

161
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:20.920
<v Speaker 1>deontologist in the sense of Oh gee </v>
<v Speaker 1>deontologist Emmanuelle con,</v>

162
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 1>he acts according to personal laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than universal ones.</v>

163
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 1>He bases his actions around a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral duties.</v>

164
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.563
<v Speaker 1>CAPP believes that his moral duty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save his friend Bucky Barnes trumps </v>

165
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever greater good might be served by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his death or imprisonment.</v>

166
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.793
<v Speaker 1>No matter how many cops bucky happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the piss out of it in the films </v>

167
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>closing minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned that all the carnage,</v>

168
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:42.004
<v Speaker 1>betrayal and heartbreak we've followed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the last two hours is the secret </v>

169
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>plan of former Sokovia in special </v>
<v Speaker 1>operatives,</v>

170
00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Zemo whose loved ones were more </v>
<v Speaker 1>collateral damage of the avengers,</v>

171
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Zemo or feels that it was his plan all </v>
<v Speaker 1>along to tear the vendor's apart.</v>

172
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Showing Tony Stark footage of bucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>barnes murdering his parents.</v>

173
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] bites enemies can rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

174
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.870
<v Speaker 1>The line was crumbles from within.</v>

175
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.833
<v Speaker 3>That's that</v>

176
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.353
<v Speaker 1>forever and here I think the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests a failing all these </v>

177
00:09:13.691 --> 00:09:14.524
<v Speaker 1>philosophical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how right participants in </v>

178
00:09:17.261 --> 00:09:18.094
<v Speaker 1>these systems believe they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will always be somebody who gets </v>

179
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:21.784
<v Speaker 1>the shaft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark is confronted by the mother </v>

180
00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>of one of the many eggs he had to crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to make a superhero omelet.</v>

181
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to avenge my son's stark?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dead and I blame you.</v>

182
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>She is essentially in the same camp as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zemo.</v>

183
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're operating for the greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

184
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.853
<v Speaker 1>your personal ethics at the behest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own country or an international </v>

185
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a Zemo that loses out.</v>

186
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with the force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As powerful as the avengers,</v>

187
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>as division says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll very strength invites challenged.</v>

188
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insights,</v>

189
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

190
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

191
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.003
<v Speaker 1>Conflict</v>

192
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.283
<v Speaker 1>breeds catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone is always going to get shafted </v>

193
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>by these philosophical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the team doing the shafting has</v>

194
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>the collective force of a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>superpower,</v>

195
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.423
<v Speaker 1>the forces that challenged them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll invite equally destructive force </v>

196
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and that can turn out pretty poorly for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

197
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think are the avengers </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to agree to the accords?</v>

198
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.773
<v Speaker 1>Should captain America give up his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>code for the greater good or are there </v>

199
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:25.494
