00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Leaders or the one smart enough to hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>people smarter than them,</v>

2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.583
<v Speaker 1>but that's the first thing you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get four or five people </v>

3
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>that are smarter than you guys have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work together.</v>

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You guys have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>start from the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about all the good ideas and think</v>

6
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>about all the bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the good outweighs the bad,</v>

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>then you should go with the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always good,</v>

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>then you should probably think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

9
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:35.441
<v Speaker 1>But that's always been my philosophy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have guys that are very intelligent,</v>

10
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>very smart work for me with my ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their intelligence,</v>

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.063
<v Speaker 1>my intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been working out pretty good so </v>

12
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a dictatorship,</v>

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act as a leader,</v>

14
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>but I take input from everybody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

15
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hey,</v>

16
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good idea.</v>

17
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.473
<v Speaker 1>most of the time I am kind of voting </v>
<v Speaker 1>without going through the voting </v>

19
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.264
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just say it's five of us and </v>

20
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>three says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should do it.</v>

21
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Says we should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably won't do it.</v>

22
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on a team and you have to do</v>

23
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:05.774
<v Speaker 1>everything collaboratively and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're not going to get along </v>

24
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you're going to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

25
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>but the respect factor is always there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

26
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you respect each other,</v>

27
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat everyone with respect and,</v>

28
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just listened to everybody's views.</v>

29
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite books is the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute manager.</v>

31
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.053
<v Speaker 1>when I'm listening to my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing is I don't act like I know </v>

33
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hear suggestions,</v>

34
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.013
<v Speaker 1>I put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My suggestion is that we have a couple </v>

35
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>meetings and then we just ironed it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just figured it out.</v>

36
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I learn every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

38
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.263
<v Speaker 1>the good thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has brought me along the way as I </v>

39
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>know how to win championships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to build teams.</v>

40
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have great teammates surrounding me.</v>

41
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>anytime I get into a venture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>most of the time we know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and if it's a problem,</v>

44
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>we figured out as a team.</v>
