00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>You have an APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is actually,</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like a zillion ar,</v>

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you can take a trip to outer space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the international space station.</v>

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>They're also all these sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>suborbital flights you can take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.013
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.853
<v Speaker 1>to the tune of $35 million and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a mass industry at this </v>

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still kind of a niche.</v>

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I think we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we will,</v>

11
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's 25 years out or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit longer.</v>

12
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:33.061
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson is doing some amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

14
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>He's putting a big bet on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I think the appeal is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to become,</v>

16
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a pretty rarefied group</v>

17
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>of people who get to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's just such a nifty idea to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating above,</v>

19
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>above the earth and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.833
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing the curvature of the earth </v>

22
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>and seeing the stars above you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

23
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to do that.</v>

24
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do more of a Middle East.</v>

25
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like Oman and Yemen Oman's been </v>

27
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>pretty stable for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Yemen has been a little,</v>

28
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>unless less stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to come up.</v>

29
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I think Iran is it as an emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>

30
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>our political relationship with the Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible right now,</v>

32
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of Europeans going </v>

34
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other Asians going there,</v>

35
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's magnificent country with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>to offer.</v>

36
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same with Pakistan.</v>

37
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.734
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to Pakistan right now </v>

38
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.373
<v Speaker 1>because it seems too edgy and Vol tile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think as hopefully as things </v>

39
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>stabilize and situations improve their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

41
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>some fantastic things to see that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think Americans be interested in seeing.</v>
