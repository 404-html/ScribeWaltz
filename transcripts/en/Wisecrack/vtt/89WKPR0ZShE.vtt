1
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.421
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleshy,</v>

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.153
<v Speaker 1>jared again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and today we're breaking down season </v>

4
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode nine of Rick and Morty,</v>

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the abcs of Beth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode is one of my favorites,</v>

6
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:17.061
<v Speaker 1>not only because it develops Beth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some interesting ways,</v>

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but because it builds on a theme from </v>
<v Speaker 1>way back in another season.</v>

8
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.941
<v Speaker 1>Three favorite pick on that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of choice.</v>

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack quick take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the abcs of Beth.</v>

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap.</v>

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>The father of Beth's adolescent friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy.</v>

12
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It's about to be put to death for </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>

13
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>His son that's soon realizes her </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood fantasy of fruit.</v>

14
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>De Leon was not some mechanism to cope </v>
<v Speaker 1>with her friend's death,</v>

15
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.743
<v Speaker 1>but a very real place built by rick to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep her sociopathic tendencies out of </v>

16
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

17
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Tommy has built a kingdom on incest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannibalism.</v>

18
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I sustain myself?</v>

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we aren't.</v>

20
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry has a new alien girlfriend,</v>

21
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.394
<v Speaker 1>Kiarra and things are moving fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your planet have shorter days </v>

22
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>because you guys are moving kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast?</v>

23
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry decides to break up with her,</v>

24
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:07.584
<v Speaker 1>but isn't able to take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>for his decision and blames his kid </v>

25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.263
<v Speaker 1>after kid tries to murder morning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer for allegedly causing the </v>

26
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:15.684
<v Speaker 1>breakup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry finally owns up to his actions in </v>

27
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>the abcs of Beth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the A and b plots parallel each other.</v>

28
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.673
<v Speaker 1>We have Beth Cherry and even greg </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to take responsibility for </v>

29
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:27.024
<v Speaker 1>their choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth refuses to acknowledge sentencing </v>

30
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Tommy to a life of humping teletubby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy,</v>

31
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you deserve an apology.</v>

32
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And Rick Denies Building for Upi land to</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid being emotionally available to his</v>

33
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

34
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.153
<v Speaker 1>You think you deserve an apology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Jerry refuses to take </v>

35
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for ending his toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Kiarra.</v>

36
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So what does all this have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle rick?</v>

37
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

38
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.293
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's because the only truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unapproachable concept for you is that </v>

39
00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 2>it's your mind within your control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You chose to come here.</v>

40
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:00.694
<v Speaker 2>You chose to talk to belittle my </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocation just as you chose to become a </v>

41
00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 2>pickle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of us gets to choose.</v>

42
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.683
<v Speaker 1>As we've mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this season is playing a lot with the </v>

43
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:10.624
<v Speaker 1>ideas of agency freedom and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly choice as Dr Wong noted in </v>

44
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:16.564
<v Speaker 1>brick managing the stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morty is angry at his father for having </v>

45
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:19.654
<v Speaker 1>no agency standing in the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about company can either tell </v>

46
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>her you want to stay married or get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your life,</v>

47
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop being a baby in pickle.</v>

48
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.004
<v Speaker 1>Rick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick literally gives up his freedom by </v>

49
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:36.661
<v Speaker 1>becoming a pickle and elaborate ruse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid therapy in the Rick Landis mixup.</v>

50
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>We see what happens when ricks give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their freedom and of course in the world</v>

51
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>early conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite moments in the season</v>

52
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:45.034
<v Speaker 1>is this advice to jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there comes a time in every man's </v>

53
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>life when he must choose the foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>on which his legacy will be built.</v>

54
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>What of compromise one of blood in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle.</v>

55
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.063
<v Speaker 1>Quick take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about how some of the ideas </v>

56
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>represented their mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Paul Sartre,</v>

57
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>idea of bad faith for a very quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>refresher.</v>

58
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.373
<v Speaker 1>Bad faith is when we negate the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom we are afforded in our ability </v>

59
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>to make choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense,</v>

60
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:18.361
<v Speaker 1>we choose not to choose after she </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes she's no different than God.</v>

61
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth has an identity crisis to head.</v>

62
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of excuses to not be who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who am I?</v>

63
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.293
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do to Sanchez is cursed with </v>

64
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaning and an uncaring world.</v>

65
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Am I evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse?</v>

66
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>You're smart when you know nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

67
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.910
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is yours and I've never met</v>
<v Speaker 1>a universe that was into it.</v>

68
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Rick's conversation reflects on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>upstarts points for sorry.</v>

69
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.123
<v Speaker 1>The whole problem of our existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts with the fact that there is no </v>

70
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>inherent meaning and departing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarta bit.</v>

71
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.213
<v Speaker 1>Any attempt to draw meaning from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe will be met with cosmic </v>

72
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>indifference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>smart people get a chance to climb on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

74
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>take reality for a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll never stop trying to throw you</v>

75
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>and eventually it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way off for rick.</v>

76
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.543
<v Speaker 1>Those smart enough get to take reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a ride before they too are </v>

77
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>inevitably thrown off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or in other words,</v>

78
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>they can indulge in whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

79
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but when reality catches up with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.154
<v Speaker 1>we've seen it before with rick best </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels trapped by her family and her </v>

81
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>arguably ironic attachment to abc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bachelor's.</v>

82
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.833
<v Speaker 1>She readily denies her own freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thus the choices available to her with </v>

83
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>the facts of her existence can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

84
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.213
<v Speaker 1>The kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerry my job and as much as I hate to </v>

85
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:32.824
<v Speaker 1>admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ABC's the Bachelor Rick Solution isn't </v>

86
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.194
<v Speaker 1>to free her necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to give her a choice can make a </v>

87
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>clone of you a perfect instance of view </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all your memories and exact copy in</v>

88
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>every way and 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide for the kids.</v>

89
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Do your job and consume broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>network reality TV on the same allegedly</v>

90
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>ironic level as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be gone a day,</v>

91
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>a week or the rest of your life with </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero consequences.</v>

92
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>The moment you decided to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flipped a switch and the clumps job is</v>

93
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels no pain,</v>

94
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.853
<v Speaker 1>regrets nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has zero chance of going blade </v>

95
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The important thing here is rick doesn't</v>

96
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.773
<v Speaker 1>argue that she should do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but says then stay and luxuriate in a </v>

97
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 1>life you can finally know you've chosen </v>
<v Speaker 1>my secret bonuses,</v>

98
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.603
<v Speaker 1>that no matter what you choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're finally going to chill the fuck </v>

99
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

100
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not whether she takes rick up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clone or not,</v>

101
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that she makes a choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matters.</v>

102
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.633
<v Speaker 1>The prospect of the clone confronts Beth</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her absolute freedom and just by </v>

103
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.014
<v Speaker 1>putting her in this crossroads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick is prompting her to choose her </v>

104
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:30.364
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

105
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.203
<v Speaker 1>So no matter what she chooses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choice brings resolved or her </v>

106
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>identity crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe Rick has learned something from</v>

107
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:38.164
<v Speaker 1>Dr Wong afterall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can split hairs on reddit forums for </v>

108
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>hours on whether or not Beth decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take rick's offer,</v>

109
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not Beth abandoned her family.</v>

110
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that she chose that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately help her find meaning.</v>

111
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>So what about evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry?</v>

112
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>He claims he is an evil but just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower.</v>

113
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick tells Beth,</v>

114
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>she's not evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just smart,</v>

115
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.253
<v Speaker 1>but are we to believe rick or is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>for intelligence used to justify </v>
