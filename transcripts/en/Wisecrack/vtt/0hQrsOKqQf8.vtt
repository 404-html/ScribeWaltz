00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I think we have an example</v>

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 2>where I originally came out of Pacifica </v>
<v Speaker 2>was founded in 1949 in Berkeley,</v>

3
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 2>California by a war resister named Lou </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hill.</v>

4
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.743
<v Speaker 2>He came out of the detention camps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said there has to be a media outlet </v>

5
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>that is not run by corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That profit from war,</v>

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has not run by corporations.</v>

7
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 2>As George Gerbner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 2>founder of the cultural environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

9
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 2>former dean at the Annenberg School of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Communications,</v>

10
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.234
<v Speaker 2>University of Pennsylvania said not run </v>
<v Speaker 2>by corporations that have nothing to </v>

11
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 2>tell and everything to sell that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising our children today.</v>

12
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 2>So pacifica was born the first station </v>
<v Speaker 2>KPFA in Berkeley in 1949.</v>

13
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Second station 10 years later in Los </v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles,</v>

14
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 2>59,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Kpf k 1960 Wbai in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1977.</v>

16
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:05.641
<v Speaker 2>WPFW in Washington and 1970 K PFT and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston.</v>

17
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Those are the five Pacific istation's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.663
<v Speaker 2>they are the original models of listener</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsorship that you turn to the </v>

19
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 2>listener and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

20
00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 2>if you appreciate what you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to agree with everything.</v>

21
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.383
<v Speaker 2>But if you appreciate this forum for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to debate and discuss the </v>

22
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 2>critical issues of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please support it.</v>

23
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>KP of t when it went on the air in 1970,</v>

24
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a few months,</v>

25
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the small station Houston was blown off </v>

26
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 2>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

27
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.113
<v Speaker 2>the Ku Klux Klan blew it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They strap dynamite to the base of the </v>

28
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.194
<v Speaker 2>transmitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if it was the exalted </v>

29
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.820
<v Speaker 2>cyclops or the Grand Dragon because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>often confuse their titles,</v>

30
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.043
<v Speaker 2>but they said it was their proudest act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because they understood how </v>

31
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:52.264
<v Speaker 2>dangerous Pacifica is dangerous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it allows people to speak for </v>

32
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:57.184
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you hear someone speaking for </v>

33
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it breaks down the bigotry,</v>

34
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.293
<v Speaker 2>the hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the characatures that fueled the hate </v>

35
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a very important model.</v>

36
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public radio and television adopted it.</v>

37
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 2>National Public Radio and PBS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 2>we all know the listener and viewer fund</v>
<v Speaker 2>drives on the air,</v>

39
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:20.614
<v Speaker 2>but they tended to move away from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to corporate </v>

40
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:25.420
<v Speaker 2>underwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

41
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more.</v>

42
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 2>But Pacific has remained true to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of listener sponsorship.</v>

43
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is a critical model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

44
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.123
<v Speaker 2>for authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent media in this country </v>

45
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.193
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
