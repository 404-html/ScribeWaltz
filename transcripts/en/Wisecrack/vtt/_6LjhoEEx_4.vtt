1
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.203
<v Speaker 1>When you look at public opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the clearest markers of how </v>

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.203
<v Speaker 1>dramatically things have shifted as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people who say that they know </v>

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>an openly gay or lesbian person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.423
<v Speaker 1>back in 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 24% of Americans who said they </v>

5
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open gay or lesbian person,</v>

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by last year that had shifted up to 88%.</v>

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually dedicated the book,</v>

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a statistics book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We dedicated the book to a,</v>

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.613
<v Speaker 1>an unknown number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the number of people who have </v>

12
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>had the courage to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>and that's an impossible number to </v>
<v Speaker 1>documenter or quantify,</v>

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is the starting point for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolutionary progress that has been</v>

15
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Milk and other pioneers of gay </v>

17
00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.514
<v Speaker 1>and Lesbian Liberation made that basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that coming out was a first step </v>

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>towards greater equality because </v>
<v Speaker 1>visibility would lead straight Americans</v>

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>to understand and accept and embrace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an advocate for equality for lgbt folks.</v>

20
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>And so this movement toward acceptance I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is completely intertwined with the</v>

21
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.261
<v Speaker 1>growing visibility and the openness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty that lgbt folks have embraced.</v>

22
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think data collection and,</v>

23
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dissemination of,</v>

24
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>of survey results and polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>if we're talking about what the single </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important factor might be in,</v>

29
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:49.991
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the revolution toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater equality for lgbt people,</v>

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.033
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at the media and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that media portrayals have </v>

32
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>shifted so dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>that's one of my favorite chapters in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book actually.</v>

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm the section on film and TV and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of media,</v>

35
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when you look at early television </v>

36
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>portrayals in the seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

37
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were occasional gay and lesbian </v>

38
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.224
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally the laughing stock of any </v>

39
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>given show and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>the very first gay couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.873
<v Speaker 1>was on a norman lear a series called hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>l Baltimore about this hotel in </v>

42
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:28.794
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore.</v>

43
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that program wasn't even broadcast in </v>

44
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore and it was canceled after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of episodes.</v>

45
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>And it was proceeded by this warning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

47
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>to make sure parents didn't allow their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children to be corrupted by the,</v>

48
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morally questionable content.</v>

49
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.553
<v Speaker 1>And so you fast forward from that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like will and grace or the </v>

50
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>ellen degeneres show where you have open</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay and lesbian characters.</v>

51
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually living their lives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can quibble.</v>

52
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think for good reason with some of</v>

53
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>the portrayals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the overall trend,</v>

54
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.353
<v Speaker 1>just the very fact that mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>television and network television is </v>

55
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>showing and embracing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.310
<v Speaker 1>healthy gay characters in committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and a,</v>

57
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.950
<v Speaker 1>a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.013
<v Speaker 1>positive light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that has been fundamental to </v>

59
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:24.874
<v Speaker 1>the changes we've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I also think that the ongoing </v>

60
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>collection of data through organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Gallup and the Williams Institute,</v>

61
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

62
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.053
<v Speaker 1>is also fundamental in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminding people that there is this </v>

63
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>trend towards greater acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one,</v>

64
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

65
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.793
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that growing acceptance as reflected by </v>

66
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>the numbers leads people to be more open</v>
<v Speaker 1>with pollsters.</v>

67
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>So that if the Gallup's numbers on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.214
<v Speaker 1>should same sex activity be legal as </v>
<v Speaker 1>those numbers go up or should same sex </v>

69
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>be be illegalized as those numbers go </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

71
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that reporting in turn </v>

72
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:14.281
<v Speaker 1>encourages people to reveal their inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

73
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.633
<v Speaker 1>So there is a trend and a cycle whereby </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing awareness and growing reporting </v>

74
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>of this awareness leads to greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance.</v>
