<v Speaker 1>unconscious human motivation and how </v>

8
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>hard it is to be a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real meat of everything is about</v>

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.493

33
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Just a quick note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the Ava reboot is beautiful,</v>

34
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:45.550
<v Speaker 1>we decided to keep our analysis to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original 26 episode series and the films</v>

35
00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll come back for more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first a quick recap.</v>

37
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.743
<v Speaker 1>In the distant future of 2015 the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is under attack by an earthly beings </v>

38
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>called angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to combat them.</v>

39
00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.853
<v Speaker 1>Humanity has created ass kicking robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sync with their pilots called </v>

40
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Ava's.</v>

41
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evas aren't all day scenes.</v>

42
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.693
<v Speaker 1>They're actually former angels infused </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the souls of humans inside the </v>

43
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>empty shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj Ba is a human.</v>

44
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Some specifically be mothers of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>various pilots.</v>

45
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Shinji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ahsoka and ray who is a clone,</v>

46
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.174
<v Speaker 1>worked together to pilot the evas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save the world and come to terms with </v>

47
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>their inner demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

48
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.790
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ray bonds,</v>

49
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:25.624
<v Speaker 1>the DNA of original angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Lilith becomes a being </v>

50
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:28.834
<v Speaker 1>containing the consciousness of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity and pretends the end of </v>

51
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't worry,</v>

52
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:33.004
<v Speaker 1>we'll cover that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do understand the ending of evangelic </v>

53
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>and we'd have to dive into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated ideas,</v>

54
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but I promise it'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part One,</v>

55
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.103
<v Speaker 1>as [inaudible] and mysticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neon genesis evangelian literally means </v>

56
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 1>a new beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neon is derived from the Greek neos,</v>

57
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.234
<v Speaker 1>which means new genesis is a beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a reference to the opening book of </v>

58
00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:53.224
<v Speaker 1>the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Evangelican is the gospel or the </v>

59
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 1>good news from the same root as </v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelize.</v>

60
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.763
<v Speaker 1>So neon genesis Evangelian is a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling of the Gospel Genesis or the </v>

61
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:04.744
<v Speaker 1>easy way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reimagining of the book of </v>

62
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Genesis with lots of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brooding and sex.</v>

63
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Ava is overflowing with religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>iconography.</v>

64
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of the references are easy to spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show references the Dead Sea scrolls</v>

65
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>explicitly incidents not depicted in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead sea scrolls may occur.</v>

66
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.093
<v Speaker 1>This should teach the old metal lesson </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ritz go installs a six six six type </v>

67
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>firewall to protect the madge I from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyber attack.</v>

68
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It cottey has installed a type six six </v>
<v Speaker 1>six firewall on the Mount Joe's external</v>

69
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>feeds surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very difficult to breach.</v>

70
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention the presence of creatures</v>
<v Speaker 1>called angels,</v>

71
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>two of which are named Adam and Lilith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might've expected eve,</v>

72
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>but Lilith is Adam's female counterpart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Jewish folklore,</v>

73
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>she was created around the same time as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and is usually described as being a</v>

74
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>mother of Daemons.</v>

75
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil in ava humans are the descendants </v>

76
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.144
<v Speaker 1>of Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the religious work is Christian </v>

77
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The [inaudible] system.</v>

78
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>The super computer network that runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerve has three parts,</v>

79
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>each named after the three wiseman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Casper Alphas are Mlq or you know,</v>

80
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>the guys that visited baby Jesus to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>him the gifts of gold and I Frankenstein</v>

81
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.594
<v Speaker 1>and Helen Mirren put the majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious imagery is based on Jewish </v>

82
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>mysticism and the Kabbalah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kabbalah is an investigative practice of</v>

83
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:15.574
<v Speaker 1>faith and mystical teachings at seeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious revelation and sacred </v>

84
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.504
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of its biggest fans are ancient </v>

85
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.904
<v Speaker 1>rabbis and also Madonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the angels and Ava are taken </v>

86
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>directly from techs and Judaism's </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended universe like Zahar.</v>

87
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Essentially the Kabbalah is Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Talmud and the book of Enoch.</v>

88
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.573
<v Speaker 1>Others are written in El Theosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a form of mystical riding that uses the </v>

89
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.863
<v Speaker 1>El Suffix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the many Hebrew words </v>

90
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>for God to tie names to the divine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all over Evangelian,</v>

91
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.850
<v Speaker 1>ramial Saatchi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old material and Caladrius.</v>

92
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

93
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Scratch that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In cobblistic tradition,</v>

94
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>the first being is Adam cadman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to be confused with the other famous</v>

95
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a being of light,</v>

96
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>which is eerily similar to the giant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

97
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>That is Ava's first angel named Adam who</v>
<v Speaker 1>explodes in the second impact.</v>

98
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.703
<v Speaker 1>That's second impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills half the population of the planet </v>

99
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>and turns the oceans read revelation </v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

100
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>This destruction is a nother call back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the cabalistic tradition.</v>

101
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>An event called the Chevron Tok Helene </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the breaking of vessels.</v>

102
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>See in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was connected.</v>

103
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Part of a universal unity that broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

104
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>leaving everything separate and creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the many splintered world we live in.</v>

105
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a theological big bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of Kabbalah is to coon,</v>

106
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>how long or the restoration of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's traditionally practice through acts</v>

107
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:34.264
<v Speaker 1>of good deeds and prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in ava it's taken kind of literally </v>

108
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>the ethical call of the Kabbalah is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reunification of the world,</v>

109
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>of the different fragmented parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam call up the syfy road,</v>

110
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>which is depicted as the tree of life as</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 circles in a particular pattern.</v>

111
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It creates a sort of visual tree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has meant to depict the tree of life.</v>

112
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>It's why the random circles a pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>around ava one when it's attacked by the</v>

113
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:59.354
<v Speaker 1>nine manufacturer angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all fulfilling the sacred duty </v>

114
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>or purpose of the Kabbalah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sephora roads re unifies everything.</v>

115
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.243
<v Speaker 1>Recreating the universe as a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole and in doing so destroys the </v>

116
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>individuality and separation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defines life as we know it.</v>

117
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Many characters pursue the goal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally reunifying the world,</v>

118
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>putting all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousnesses into one place.</v>

119
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.420
<v Speaker 1>The industry who are bitching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh stage and our souls will be at peace.</v>

120
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>This finally happens after the Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Luleth DNA combined inside of Ray.</v>

121
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.423
<v Speaker 1>The reunification with the masculine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine aspect of the angels is the </v>

122
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:41.744
<v Speaker 1>reunification of the world as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This raises the question of why exactly </v>

123
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:46.544
<v Speaker 1>the world needs to be reunited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean for the world to be </v>

124
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>broken?</v>

125
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.013
<v Speaker 1>To answer that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need only to turn to our adorable </v>

126
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>friend the hedgehog and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>

127
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Part two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hedgehogs dilemma.</v>

128
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>So much of Evangelian is eye candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

129
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>big ass robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosions,</v>

130
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>more sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse.</v>

131
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.643
<v Speaker 1>But it's at its most profound when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative dives into the crimson red </v>

132
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>lakes of sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation,</v>

133
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>and the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing this for the first time,</v>

134
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.124
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the first time it pauses on </v>

135
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:19.994
<v Speaker 1>empty streets on telephone poles where </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing scares the birds away and on </v>

136
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>classrooms with no students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world without half its population is</v>

137
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:28.034
<v Speaker 1>a sad place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of himes isn't partying like </v>

138
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:31.394
<v Speaker 1>it's 1999 it just sucks the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable lives and intimacy problems </v>

139
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>can be explained by a hedgehog and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pre eminent philosophical pessimists,</v>

140
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.813
<v Speaker 1>Arthur schopenhauer in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and perilite Hamina short </v>

141
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>philosophical essays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volume to schopenhauer details,</v>

142
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.633
<v Speaker 1>a short parable that has become known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hedgehog or the porcupines dilemma </v>

143
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.543
<v Speaker 1>in it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he explains the human condition by </v>

144
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:54.714
<v Speaker 1>comparing humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hedgehogs huddled together for </v>

145
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they crave warm,</v>

146
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>hedgehogs can't get too close because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their quills,</v>

147
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>so they keep their distance and remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold or learn to live without the warmth</v>

148
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does this have to do with ava?</v>

149
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

150
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.893
<v Speaker 1>The hedgehog is dilemma is Eva's guiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>theme in episode three Writ Sukkot </v>

151
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>explains the parable to mid Sato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the fable,</v>

152
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.993
<v Speaker 3>the hedgehogs dilemma hedgehog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean those animals with the spiny </v>

153
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:23.464
<v Speaker 3>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though a hedgehog may want to </v>

154
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 3>become close with another hedgehog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closer they get,</v>

155
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 3>the more they injure each other with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their spines.</v>

156
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>It's the same with some humans</v>

157
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and episode four it's even called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedgehogs dilemma.</v>

158
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.630
<v Speaker 1>That desire to be unhurt drives a wedge </v>
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>

159
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It creates a world of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that world and its implications.</v>

160
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.280
<v Speaker 1>In episode 16 titled Sickness Unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Death,</v>

161
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.170
<v Speaker 1>which is a reference to Danish </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>

162
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Soren Kierkegaard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sickness unto death is despair.</v>

163
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.543
<v Speaker 1>Eight terrible existential loneliness </v>
<v Speaker 1>which goes along with Schopenhauer is </v>

164
00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:57.594
<v Speaker 1>hedgehogs pretty neatly as does episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>23 after Kaji is killed and he leaves a </v>

165
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.384
<v Speaker 1>sad message on mid satos machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She remarks another phone that will </v>

166
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>never ring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the epitome of lonesomeness waiting</v>

167
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:10.824
<v Speaker 1>for someone to reach out and call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a depressing show filled with </v>

168
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.264
<v Speaker 1>depressed people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ahsoka piles her ava to find meaning in </v>

169
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without it.</v>

170
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>She's just a sad girl crying in a dingy </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

171
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>We see in flashbacks that though she may</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem gruff,</v>

172
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.500
<v Speaker 1>she fears being alone and pilots or ava </v>
<v Speaker 1>to draw people toward her and expand her</v>

173
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:31.704
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

174
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.883
<v Speaker 1>There's Kendo who struggles with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to show Shinji love and doesn't </v>

175
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:42.980
<v Speaker 1>know how to be a father when she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is near me.</v>

176
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.060
<v Speaker 1>All I ever do is causing pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he's reunited with Youi,</v>

177
00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:50.150
<v Speaker 1>he explains that I never deserved to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved,</v>

178
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.200
<v Speaker 1>so he rejected the world so he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel pain in his book.</v>

179
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:55.034
<v Speaker 1>The world as will and representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schopenhauer argues that life is </v>

180
00:09:58.221 --> 00:09:59.054
<v Speaker 1>suffering because the world is made up </v>
<v Speaker 1>of will and representation for </v>

181
00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Schopenhauer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nature of reality is unity.</v>

182
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.403
<v Speaker 1>We'd all be at peace without this </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle to communicate between </v>

183
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:09.884
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suffering is the result of </v>

184
00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:12.344
<v Speaker 1>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be human is to suffer because </v>

185
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception and understanding we'll never</v>

186
00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>be perfect and that struggled to connect</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the source of our suffering.</v>

187
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.220
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is really one thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

188
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.180
<v Speaker 1>one entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each individual will or ego can only</v>

189
00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:32.390
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world from its own vantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>point or perception.</v>

190
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what schopenhauer means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he says representation,</v>

191
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>anguish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmentation,</v>

192
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:38.774
<v Speaker 1>alienation and isolation are all because</v>
<v Speaker 1>each person is in charge of their will </v>

193
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and there is a disconnect between what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we desire and what the world gives us,</v>

194
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.310
<v Speaker 1>which is echoed by cohorts.</v>

195
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.700
<v Speaker 4>This is mankind's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If human hope,</v>

196
00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 4>this fun with the flex or Solano,</v>

197
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.300
<v Speaker 1>that's separation of wills is what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show calls a tea fields,</v>

198
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.500
<v Speaker 1>which are something like the unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>human soul that's separate each person's</v>

199
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of their life force.</v>

200
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.410
<v Speaker 1>The barrier that keeps us from truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting to each other.</v>

201
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.453
<v Speaker 1>Several times characters have </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about what it means to be </v>

202
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:12.754
<v Speaker 1>an ego and to have a body usually as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body or consciousness is slipping </v>

203
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:20.800
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray does this in episodes 14 and 23 both</v>

204
00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:21.634
<v Speaker 1>exchanges are reflections on what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be a human being that has a </v>

205
00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:27.340
<v Speaker 1>body and is recognized by others.</v>

206
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.140
<v Speaker 3>You're right at the core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are all the same.</v>

207
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.063
<v Speaker 3>Our minds lack something basic and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear that lack and that is why we are </v>

208
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 3>attempting to become one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will meld with and fill each other.</v>

209
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.483
<v Speaker 3>This is the instrumentalities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mankind cannot live without being </v>

210
00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:46.550
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mankind cannot live alone,</v>

211
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.450
<v Speaker 3>although you yourself are always unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is why life is hard.</v>

212
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.463
<v Speaker 3>That is why life is sad and empty cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to close physical and mental </v>

213
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 3>preference of others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is why we wish to me come on.</v>

214
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>This struggle with isolation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain of rejection defines ava.</v>

215
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.063
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately as schopenhauer tells us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being alive means living with will and </v>

216
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:07.834
<v Speaker 1>ego and that means pain that drive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from this pain and ego is </v>

217
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>something that we can explain what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>help of our cocaine addled friend,</v>

218
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part three psycho analysis.</v>

219
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.653
<v Speaker 1>I know people are mad because Freud is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered a hack and didn't science </v>

220
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it but hey,</v>

221
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>eva explicitly uses 40 in terms ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and analysis.</v>

222
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.883
<v Speaker 1>Episode 19 is called Trajection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 40 in term that explains how people </v>

223
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>take on characteristics of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them.</v>

224
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.263
<v Speaker 1>You know copycats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episode 20 is called weaving a story to </v>

225
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.313
<v Speaker 1>oral stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oral stage corresponds to the </v>

226
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>weaning of a child from breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Freud,</v>

227
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.193
<v Speaker 1>when a child too soon and they're out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch with people's emotions and are </v>

228
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 1>generally sociopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wean them too late and they're dependent</v>

229
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>too long on the mother for security and </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up neurotic Mama's boys.</v>

230
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin Aaron Kid from game of thrones.</v>

231
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.663
<v Speaker 1>All the kids in Ava's pilot classes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherless children or so they think in </v>

232
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:04.954
<v Speaker 1>fact Shinji.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mom is unit one soul and part of </v>

233
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Asa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mother's soul is in unit two.</v>

234
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Both Ava's use the soul's inside them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>further bond with their pilots.</v>

235
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 1>How the pilot reacts to their mother is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative of their general disposition.</v>

236
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's as 40 and is it can get there all </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

237
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 1>The last love object that is their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother except ray,</v>

238
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:28.951
<v Speaker 1>is less mournful and more melancholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she has no soul as an artificial</v>

239
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has no real loss to speak of no mama</v>

240
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>soul to snatch and put in a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Freud.</v>

241
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Mourning happens when we know what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have lost.</v>

242
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Melancholy on the other hand is much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more serious.</v>

243
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 1>It occurs when people have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's missing.</v>

244
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Only that it causes them deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep sadness,</v>

245
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.673
<v Speaker 1>hence the need for psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the last two episodes of the </v>

246
00:13:50.021 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 1>show are literally a psychotherapy </v>
<v Speaker 1>session inside Shinji his mind,</v>

247
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.380
<v Speaker 3>but if you depend only on the ava,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ava will become your only identifier.</v>

248
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.730
<v Speaker 3>April will become your own lead value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without that value you the wheel,</v>

249
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 3>you will be erased from this existence.</v>

250
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned the manager I super </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers before,</v>

251
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:07.984
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't tell you that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind of Dr Naoko Akagi imprinted in </v>

252
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:12.124
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are reflective of the tripartite </v>

253
00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>model of the human unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the controlling scientist as the ego,</v>

254
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.093
<v Speaker 1>the mother as the punishing and guilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing superego and the woman as the </v>

255
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>sexual in episode 18 is titled </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ambivalence.</v>

256
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.043
<v Speaker 1>A Freudian idea that eva really leans </v>
<v Speaker 1>into and bill mullins is the way that </v>

257
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 1>people can passionately hate and love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

258
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 1>like when I eat chipolte lake for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

259
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Shinji is constantly talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much he hates his father.</v>

260
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really hated my father,</v>

261
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.730
<v Speaker 1>yet he gets in the ava over and over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make daddy proud.</v>

262
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.743
<v Speaker 1>In episode 12 he explains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pilots the ava to hear words of </v>

263
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>praise from his dad.</v>

264
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.153
<v Speaker 3>I think I finally understood the part </v>
<v Speaker 3>about being praised by someone when I </v>

265
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:54.584
<v Speaker 3>heard my father's words today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also realized that the reason I </v>

266
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 3>pilot my ava is to hear those words from</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

267
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He runs away from his dad nerve and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities as an ava pilot,</v>

268
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.610
<v Speaker 1>but he keeps coming back.</v>

269
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I must've grown away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must've run away.</v>

270
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.070
<v Speaker 1>The real smart stuff he's done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrows and thanatos or the drive to life</v>

271
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.300
<v Speaker 1>and the death drive for Freud beings are</v>
<v Speaker 1>instilled with the pleasure principal,</v>

272
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.840
<v Speaker 1>the general inclination to avoid pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maximize pleasure.</v>

273
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.883
<v Speaker 1>So in episode 16 when Shinji falls into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the direct C or a pocket universe </v>

274
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:30.630
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

275
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.900
<v Speaker 3>this world is filled with too much pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suffering to keep going on.</v>

276
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>He's expressing his desire to minimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

277
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.650
<v Speaker 1>As it pertains to the pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

278
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.040
<v Speaker 1>this struggle to avoid pain is aligned </v>
<v Speaker 1>with schopenhauer.</v>

279
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:42.874
<v Speaker 1>His ideas about will and struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we ever avoid suffering when we </v>

280
00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:46.864
<v Speaker 1>have to share a world with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of whom have their own desires that </v>

281
00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:50.914
<v Speaker 1>sometimes get in the way of ours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we find peace for sale a nerve </v>

282
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and even individuals like Gando in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shinji?</v>

283
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It all comes back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumentalization.</v>

284
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.603
<v Speaker 1>The process by which all human </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is combined into a </v>

285
00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:03.994
<v Speaker 1>primordial soup called lcl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That desire to join a unified whole and </v>

286
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:08.914
<v Speaker 1>no longer be concerned with issues of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self comes up in Freud to it's </v>

287
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:15.550
<v Speaker 1>called the death drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The death drive is a desire to return to</v>

288
00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:18.550
<v Speaker 1>tranquility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the peace and harmony of the womb,</v>

289
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.900
<v Speaker 1>and what can be more peaceful than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of every once it's gone.</v>

290
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.763
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episode 25 has a direct call to this </v>

291
00:16:26.981 --> 00:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>with the text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The case of Shinji Akari,</v>

292
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:30.723
<v Speaker 1>the boy who wished for death of his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>will then Kendo in the mind of Shinji </v>

293
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.890
<v Speaker 1>states that instrumentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.763
<v Speaker 5>It's not a return to nothingness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is merely a return to a state of </v>

295
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:40.724
<v Speaker 5>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is no less than a return to the </v>

296
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:43.394
<v Speaker 5>primal wound that we'd lost so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Souls and minds will become one </v>

297
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 5>attaining internal balance.</v>

298
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>return to Lilith and to coon hall along </v>

299
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the restoration of the world or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reunification with the primordial being.</v>

300
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.313
<v Speaker 1>And so salian nerve are working for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death drive and they count on Shinji to </v>

301
00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:00.664
<v Speaker 1>become the arc for humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which will allow them to return to </v>

302
00:17:03.611 --> 00:17:06.190
<v Speaker 1>a world without loneliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation.</v>

303
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.323
<v Speaker 1>Conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the human reaction to the hedgehogs </v>

304
00:17:09.281 --> 00:17:12.250
<v Speaker 1>dilemma is to seek tranquility and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>return to the womb.</v>

305
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.640
<v Speaker 1>But as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's simply a desire for death,</v>

306
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.460
<v Speaker 1>a running away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what has to be done?</v>

307
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kaworu a character who is not </v>

308
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:22.294
<v Speaker 1>entirely human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shows us the way accepting </v>

309
00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:25.504
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability Kaworu gives up his </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual desires and we'll so that </v>

310
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:29.794
<v Speaker 1>Shinji can live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is unguarded and open with his </v>

311
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.243
<v Speaker 1>absolute love for Shinji.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He represents a way out of the cycle of </v>

312
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:40.840
<v Speaker 1>constant suffering and isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just gives damn good advice.</v>

313
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.500
<v Speaker 6>I know that by keeping others at a </v>
<v Speaker 6>distance,</v>

314
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.513
<v Speaker 6>you avoid a betrayal of your trust.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For a while you may not be hurt that </v>

315
00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:48.774
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mustn't that you must endure the </v>

316
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:51.684
<v Speaker 6>loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men cannot erase this sentence because </v>

317
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:55.944
<v Speaker 6>the owner fundamentally pain is </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that man must endure in his </v>

318
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 6>hard and since the heart feels pain so </v>
<v Speaker 6>easily,</v>

319
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 6>some believe life is pain.</v>

320
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.763
<v Speaker 1>In the final episodes and the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>chinchy initially accepts </v>

321
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:11.754
<v Speaker 1>instrumentalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he understands just what he'd </v>

322
00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>lose himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a change of heart.</v>

323
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Your self image is restrained by having </v>
<v Speaker 3>to observe the barriers between yourself</v>

324
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.633
<v Speaker 3>and others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot see yourself without the </v>

325
00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:26.830
<v Speaker 3>presence of awesome because there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

326
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.740
<v Speaker 3>I can perceive myself as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm alone,</v>

327
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.890
<v Speaker 3>then I will be the same without others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For this world is only of me,</v>

328
00:18:32.891 --> 00:18:35.020
<v Speaker 3>then there will be no difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and nothing.</v>

329
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.080
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shinji rejects instrumentality.</v>

330
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.140
<v Speaker 3>Hi me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be myself.</v>

331
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I want to continue existing in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>world</v>

332
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.070
<v Speaker 1>mount as a world where everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial soup and shares one mind.</v>

333
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.250
<v Speaker 3>What is this empty space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An empty world,</v>

334
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 3>a world where nothing exists with </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

335
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 3>but with only my Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing to interact with.</v>

336
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.043
<v Speaker 3>It's as if I'm here but not here at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just if I'm slowly fading out of </v>

337
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:05.874
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>

338
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 1>he ops for one where people can be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where we are in close,</v>

339
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.723
<v Speaker 1>where there is a separation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual selves where there are </v>

340
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheels,</v>

341
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.583
<v Speaker 1>desires and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He confronts the drive to inorganic </v>

342
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 1>existence and accepts the inevitability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of suffering in life.</v>

343
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.480
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the pain is too harsh,</v>

344
00:19:25.481 --> 00:19:29.140
<v Speaker 3>you can escape it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really hated changing style.</v>

345
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't.</v>

346
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of escaping a little money,</v>

347
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but he also opens the door for hope and </v>
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>

348
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he does when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejects instrumentality,</v>

349
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 1>he turns over and chokes Ahsoka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She responds by stroking his face,</v>

350
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.550
<v Speaker 1>reminding us that the world they chose </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of violence and pain,</v>

351
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 1>but also love all three elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

352
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.073
<v Speaker 1>The theological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and philosophical deal </v>

353
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:00.480
<v Speaker 1>with something called lack in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

354
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 1>lack as explored by the Freud inspired </v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho analysis and philosophers.</v>

355
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Lacan is the missing center at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of our existence,</v>

356
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.180
<v Speaker 1>the missing piece between representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world in itself,</v>

357
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 1>whether it be a scarcity of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>

358
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 1>marriages and relationships or distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>between father and son.</v>

359
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.373
<v Speaker 1>Eva is able to consistently weave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applaud that delves deep into the </v>

360
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>visceral reality of humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointing existence.</v>

361
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Three pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray,</v>

362
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.434
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese word for soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost not or zero in unit zero Shinji </v>

363
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:34.560
<v Speaker 1>the pilot of unit number one.</v>

364
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>The first real person introduced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

365
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the pilot of unit number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl a call back to the expulsion from</v>

366
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of infinite knowledge and life</v>

367
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 1>in the end it's just asa and Shinji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new Adam and eve,</v>

368
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.833
<v Speaker 1>a new beginning.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hovering anime has been a really awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for us since the stuff that </v>

375
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:14.370
<v Speaker 1>is popular is actually really profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my favorite videos aren't anime,</v>

376
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.213
<v Speaker 1>like our episodes on death note attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Titan and full metal alchemist </v>

377
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:19.990
