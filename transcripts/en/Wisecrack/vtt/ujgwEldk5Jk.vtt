1
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys finally got a haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.793
<v Speaker 1>after 14 years of patiently waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we finally got to see the incredibles </v>

3
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>two and it pretty much shattered all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictions we made on our movie.</v>

4
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Podcasts showed me the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now as the movie,</v>

5
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we expected that,</v>

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>but what surprised us is just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful the film is and it all has to</v>

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.684
<v Speaker 1>do with the films villain screen slaver </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only to screen slaver Dole out some </v>

9
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.194
<v Speaker 1>majorly relevant commentary on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of our culture's obsession with </v>

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.264
<v Speaker 1>screens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her presence Mike just make the </v>

11
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>incredibles two the most subversive </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero movie ever made.</v>

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.193
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this wisecrack quick take </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the incredibles two and watch out a </v>

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>monster amount of spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as always,</v>

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>first a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen gets recruited by media mogul,</v>

15
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.294
<v Speaker 1>Winston Devers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new PR campaign is goal change the </v>

16
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.044
<v Speaker 1>public face of supers in order to reform</v>
<v Speaker 1>their image and eventually changed the </v>

17
00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>laws that outlawed them.</v>

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr incredible has to take over parenting</v>

19
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.234
<v Speaker 1>duties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means helping violet through her </v>

20
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.124
<v Speaker 1>boy drama and trying to contain Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack's mind boggling new powers as the </v>

21
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.624
<v Speaker 1>PR blitz kicks off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen's job quickly takes her face to </v>

22
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>face with screen slaver who literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses computers and television screens to</v>

23
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>control people like a Jedi mind trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a film degree.</v>

24
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.053
<v Speaker 1>Here's the fundamental theme at the core</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the films conflict that in the </v>

25
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>digital age perception has supplanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.703
<v Speaker 1>Early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston introduces us to this idea when </v>

27
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>he explains the real reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>superheroes were outlawed.</v>

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.283
<v Speaker 1>Public perception was against them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people associated superheroes </v>

29
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>with the crime scenes they superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

30
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>He argues that in order to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

31
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>first we need to change people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions about superheroes.</v>

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.003
<v Speaker 1>Essentially Winston's pitch is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of supers as communicated by the </v>

33
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>media is more real than their lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

34
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.383
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston thinks that changing the public </v>

35
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.604
<v Speaker 1>perception of supers rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing any of their actual deeds is </v>

36
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:00.774
<v Speaker 1>essential to getting the ban lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his plan is to create a specially </v>

37
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>curated reality of supers to be consumed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the American people.</v>

38
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>How will he do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By sticking a camera in Helen super suit</v>

39
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.873
<v Speaker 1>and making her both a walking virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality machine and a serious </v>

40
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>competition to twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>

41
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:17.994
<v Speaker 1>we meet the villains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Screensaver later revealed to be Evelyn </v>

42
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:21.294
<v Speaker 1>mind controlling a pizza delivery guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's motivation is actually a </v>

43
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:25.464
<v Speaker 1>rather sophisticated critique of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindless media consumption and how it </v>

44
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>makes people passive participants in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own lives.</v>

45
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.053
<v Speaker 1>She gives a truly epic monologue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which she complained about the way how </v>

46
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>everything meaningful must be packaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>into talk shows,</v>

47
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>game shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel shows,</v>

48
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.093
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gc supers as an essential part of that </v>

49
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:45.384
<v Speaker 1>media landscape and that they offer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>security and comfort that keeps the </v>

50
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>masses docile.</v>

51
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.903
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where our philosophy census </v>

52
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>started tinGling the plot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inCredibles.</v>

53
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Two is a neon sign pointing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher slash guy.</v>

54
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to mention a lot the genre </v>
<v Speaker 1>baudrillard who wrote about the power of</v>

55
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>screens to influence our opinions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed control our lives.</v>

56
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>In his book screened out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he argues that video interactive screens</v>

57
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>and virtual reality have brought us into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a state of perpetual interactivity where</v>

58
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no longer any separation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media we consume and lives we lead.</v>

59
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.663
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he argues the virtual reality of the </v>

60
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tv,</v>

61
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:25.414
<v Speaker 1>and video games seems more real than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world we inhabit and even supersedes </v>

62
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both winston and evelyn take this theory</v>

63
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.754
<v Speaker 1>and run with it in very different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each is trying to use the mediated </v>

64
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.224
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat the perception of superheroes to </v>

65
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>change reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I belong.</v>

66
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.863
<v Speaker 1>Baudrillard says that the real aim of </v>
<v Speaker 1>media consumption is to hide or </v>

67
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>disappear into the virtual.</v>

68
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.323
<v Speaker 1>An idea that evelyn's goggles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens exaggerate to great effect by </v>

69
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.764
<v Speaker 1>hypnotizing people into a fugue state in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they are completely detached from </v>

70
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>

71
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>the film warns about the harmful power </v>
<v Speaker 1>of screens to control our lives.</v>

72
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.173
<v Speaker 1>the immersive power of helen's pov crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting videos create exactly the kind </v>

73
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.124
<v Speaker 1>of absorbing media bosure discusses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so effective and </v>

74
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>immediately start shifting public </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

75
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for plot development.</v>

76
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>helen's emo of saving people from bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys hasn't changed a bit,</v>

77
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>but now that people can see her bravery </v>
<v Speaker 1>up close,</v>

78
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.303
<v Speaker 1>it's suddenly more real at times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie isn't too subtle about any of </v>

79
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>

80
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.033
<v Speaker 1>evelyn and helen debate like drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy majors about whether the </v>

81
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:33.484
<v Speaker 1>selling of the product I the mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of it is more important than the </v>

82
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.344
<v Speaker 1>product itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they can't come to a solid </v>

83
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:40.954
<v Speaker 1>conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems fair because modern </v>

84
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.204
<v Speaker 1>philosophers can't either and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had thousands of pages of writing on </v>

85
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.834
<v Speaker 1>which to try.</v>

86
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we later learned that evelyn's beef with</v>

87
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>superheroes is less egg heady and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>

88
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>WheN burglars broke into her family's </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

89
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>her father counted on his superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies to save him.</v>

90
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Instead of using his safe room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was shot dead.</v>

91
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.433
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she now blamed superheroes for her </v>

92
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:05.764
<v Speaker 1>father's passed city and clear inability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think logically in high pressure </v>

93
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she decides to use the very thing she</v>

94
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:17.101
<v Speaker 1>despises the image of supers to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>their viability and importance to her.</v>

95
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Not only do screens make us passive </v>
<v Speaker 1>observers in our own lives,</v>

96
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>but the image of superheroes on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens does something similar.</v>

97
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>The images of benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all powerful beings,</v>

98
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>perhaps primus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe like evelyn's dad,</v>

99
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>that our problems will be solved by </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong altruistic individuals,</v>

100
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>but wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't we to watching the incredibles?</v>

101
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:41.554
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a superhero movie through a screen and </v>

102
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:45.214
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where the film gets potentially </v>

103
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>very subversive.</v>

104
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.283
<v Speaker 1>Are we not also participating in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>same vicarious hero worship when we </v>

105
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>watched in awe as the incredible saved </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day on the flashy silver screen?</v>

106
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 1>So what are we supposed to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a superhero movie that </v>

107
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>criticizes the effects of selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>superheroes?</v>

108
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>do mediated images?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the ending is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>comforting to fans.</v>

110
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop screen slaver supers are made legal</v>

111
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>again by some sort of un knockoff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evelyn is carted off by the police,</v>

112
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but just when everything is about to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped up nice and neat.</v>

113
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.553
<v Speaker 1>Violet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's third power is apparently sarcasm </v>

114
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>immediately jumps in to cast doubt on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our happy ending saying,</v>

115
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry that she's super rich and will</v>
<v Speaker 1>only get like two years in jail,</v>

116
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>so should the incredible saving the city</v>
