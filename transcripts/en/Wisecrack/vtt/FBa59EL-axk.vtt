<v Speaker 1>What's up wisecrack jared?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>if you guys haven't seen the torrent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets,</v>

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new show,</v>

6
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>the haunting of hill house is getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>some serious notoriety.</v>

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It's got a 93% fresh rating on rotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes and some people are saying it's</v>

8
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>so scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're puking their guts out seriously,</v>

9
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to the question in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genre as bloated as horror.</v>

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>What makes another story about a haunted</v>
<v Speaker 1>house stand out?</v>

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.833
<v Speaker 1>While we could point to the casting </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera work or one of the best jump </v>

12
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>scares I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually think it has to do with wait</v>

13
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ghosts.</v>

14
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.023
<v Speaker 1>but what makes hillhouse rise above </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows like American horror story is a </v>

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>duality of the ghost metaphor that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly smart.</v>

17
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.423
<v Speaker 1>So grab those adult diapers and join me </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this wisecrack quick take on the </v>

18
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:58.814
<v Speaker 1>haunting of Hill House and yes was head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get into it and want to </v>

19
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>give a shout out to our sponsor over at </v>

<v Speaker 1>You may have heard of called fortnite </v>
<v Speaker 1>hop on a battle bus and had to an island</v>

22

<v Speaker 1>to hear more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>

26
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>First a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show follows the cranes during their</v>

27
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>stay at the haunted hill house in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1980s while the parents,</v>

28
00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Olivia and hugh are trying to flip the </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

29
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.793
<v Speaker 1>Mother and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to finish fixing this house and </v>

30
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>then someone has to buy it 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it was trendy.</v>

31
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.523
<v Speaker 1>The kids spend the summer being </v>
<v Speaker 1>irreparably traumatized by a series of </v>

32
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>terrifying events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all comes to an end though.</v>

33
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>When the father rushes the kids out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house one night.</v>

34
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>What the show portrays is some spooky </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting business from the perspective of</v>

35
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>the children is eventually revealed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the suicide of the mother.</v>

36
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.183
<v Speaker 1>Flash forward to the presence and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the children are still living under the </v>

37
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>shadow of their past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

38
00:01:58.601 --> 00:01:59.434
<v Speaker 1>the oldest is a successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>albeit cynical author writing about his </v>

39
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:03.664
<v Speaker 1>paranormal childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shirley is a tightly wound type A </v>

40
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:07.054
<v Speaker 1>mortician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vo is a clinical psychologist with some </v>

41
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:09.904
<v Speaker 1>serious intimacy issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke is a junkie 90 days clean and his </v>

42
00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:14.164
<v Speaker 1>twin sister now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now's dead and it's her death that </v>

43
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:18.244
<v Speaker 1>starts off a fresh batch of hauntings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If those character descriptions haven't </v>

44
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:22.624
<v Speaker 1>tipped you off already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes and hill house aren't your </v>

45
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 1>typical cookie cutter characters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other horror series,</v>

46
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>but to understand how they're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

47
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>we first have to understand an idea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing called the ghost,</v>

48
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.103
<v Speaker 1>which has been explored by the author K </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Weiland as we'll see what makes the </v>

49
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.124
<v Speaker 1>haunting of hill house so good is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blurry boundary between Weiland's ghost </v>

50
00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>as technique and the show's ghost as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

51
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with that kid?</v>

52
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.483
<v Speaker 1>As for wildland scopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is this at the beginning of a </v>

53
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:51.784
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our heroes aren't usually the greatest </v>

54
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:54.334
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be jealous like woody and toy </v>

55
00:02:55.901 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>story or selfish like ebeneezer scrooge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a Christmas according to wildland.</v>

56
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.533
<v Speaker 1>At the heart of these personal feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies a basic psychological mechanism in </v>

57
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>which we value survival in one aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives over survival in another.</v>

58
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd lean into certain beliefs even </v>

59
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>though they might make us unhappy just </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can survive.</v>

60
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why we formed these </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

61
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Weiland calls this your ghost though </v>
<v Speaker 1>other authors,</v>

62
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>we'll call it your wound or simply your </v>
<v Speaker 1>past trauma for woody in toy story,</v>

63
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.683
<v Speaker 1>his ghost or trauma is the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unloved toys are discarded causing </v>

64
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.334
<v Speaker 1>his jealousy of buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which blinds him to his unsavory </v>

65
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Scrooge,</v>

66
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>his ghost is the poverty he experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his childhood,</v>

67
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>which later causes him to be the penny </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinching man.</v>

68
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>We all know blinding him to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has ruined his life.</v>

69
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.303
<v Speaker 1>What he and scrooge up to protect their </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound fear and poverty respectively at </v>

70
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>the expense of everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the haunting of Hill House,</v>

71
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.273
<v Speaker 1>it becomes clear that the actual ghosts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are some kind of metaphor for the </v>

72
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>horrifying events the crane family </v>
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>

73
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Chevron are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Flanagan expertly leverages each </v>

74
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:06.874
<v Speaker 1>character's past trauma or ghost to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain why our heroes are so messed up </v>

75
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:12.454
<v Speaker 1>as adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve witnessing his mother's friend </v>

76
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.463
<v Speaker 1>mental state firsthand rationalizes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole childhood as a product of mental </v>

77
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

78
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:21.634
<v Speaker 1>he's so convinced that his family has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic mental condition that he gets a </v>

79
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:25.504
<v Speaker 1>vasectomy right out of college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there something wrong with our </v>

80
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>goddamn brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

81
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:36.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm never having children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made sure surely who takes in a box of</v>

82
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.444
<v Speaker 1>kittens as a child only to have them go </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead and crazy demonic becomes </v>

83
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>fascinated with the way morticians fix a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person making a corpse seem alive again.</v>

84
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsurprisingly.</v>

85
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>She then becomes a control freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mortician as for Theo,</v>

86
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.273
<v Speaker 1>her special ability to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence of something by touching it </v>

87
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>backfires when she touches her mom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sees a rotting corpse.</v>

88
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>And how does the o turnout as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she flexes her ability to help people in</v>

89
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:09.964
<v Speaker 1>her day job while wearing gloves in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>free time and having shallow emotional </v>

90
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Luke,</v>

91
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke's substance abuse stems from </v>

92
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:19.384
<v Speaker 1>watching his mom poison and kill his </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood friend and from the various </v>

93
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>obsessive coping mechanisms he developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to distract himself.</v>

94
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.063
<v Speaker 1>Like any good story though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the haunting of hill house builds out </v>

95
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it's conflicts by having characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront their trauma.</v>

96
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>And this is the part where we get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>literal ghosts of the show.</v>

97
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a seriously large grab bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ghosts in the series.</v>

98
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look hard enough,</v>

99
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you can see a random ghosts lingering in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background of almost any shot.</v>

100
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.913
<v Speaker 1>And while there's a whole cast of ghouls</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have almost nothing to do with our </v>

101
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:48.304
<v Speaker 1>characters back stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most memorable ghost or the </v>

102
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>personified embodiments of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>

103
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>past traumas in psychoanalytic terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could view these literal ghosts as an</v>

104
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.364
<v Speaker 1>example of splitting where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>splinter off and repackage the negative </v>

105
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:02.924
<v Speaker 1>parts of themselves or others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor to maintain a positive sense of </v>

106
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Weiland said,</v>

107
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it's all about survival except in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crane family's case.</v>

108
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>The unconference did trauma manifests as</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual ghost.</v>

109
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>The literary ghost becomes a literal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghosts.</v>

110
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's in the red room where all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>literal manifestations of trauma come to</v>

111
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.514
<v Speaker 1>the fore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real is like the heart of the </v>

112
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a hard to stomach.</v>

113
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.373
<v Speaker 1>And the series closing episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our surviving crane children </v>

114
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.704
<v Speaker 1>converge in the red room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the house puts them each to a </v>

115
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:36.734
<v Speaker 1>mental test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must confront their literal and </v>

116
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Steve,</v>

117
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:42.284
<v Speaker 1>he must confront his concern over his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family's tainted blood line when he </v>

118
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 1>experiences a room 1408 moment and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transported into the future,</v>

119
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>or he got out of Hill House alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete with a happy pregnant wife.</v>

120
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.343
<v Speaker 1>That is until he realizes he never left </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and his wife's baby becomes a </v>

121
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 1>literal rot splitting open her stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty gruesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surely on the other hand,</v>

123
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>must confront her inability to fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

124
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.893
<v Speaker 1>including her personal shortcomings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she does so by reliving her own </v>

125
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:09.794
<v Speaker 1>secret affair.</v>

126
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.390
<v Speaker 2>You did it any light in and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided not to look at it.</v>

127
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Now that's all over.</v>

128
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Charlene never wants to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are even worse for Fiona.</v>

129
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:21.664
<v Speaker 1>She grapples with her self imposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional isolation while on the bed </v>

130
00:07:24.581 --> 00:07:25.414
<v Speaker 1>with her casual lover feel loses her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to feel anything at all and a </v>

131
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>thousand hands drag her down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Luke,</v>

132
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.130
<v Speaker 1>well Lucas transported back in time back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the tea party with his mom,</v>

133
00:07:36.131 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 1>his twin now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his childhood friend Luke glimpsing.</v>

134
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 1>A life without the pain of addiction or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of the three people closest to</v>

135
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:48.331
<v Speaker 1>him is tempted to sit down and give it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is until Nell saves him go.</v>

136
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

137
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>why would you want your brother to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

138
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>just got here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a seat.</v>

139
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.373
<v Speaker 1>Don't exactly as she saves all the crane</v>
<v Speaker 1>children by pulling them out of their </v>

140
00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

141
00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:07.200
<v Speaker 1>some of you might think that Nell </v>
<v Speaker 1>swooping in is a Dsx Mokena ending,</v>

142
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>but as story guru slash wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite Dan harmon would tell you,</v>

143
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.263
<v Speaker 1>the characters in this portion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story have earned it by confronting the </v>

144
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:20.340
<v Speaker 1>worst parts of themselves in their past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've grown as people and the universe</v>

145
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.790
<v Speaker 1>is responding by throwing them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifeline in the form of now.</v>

146
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.983
<v Speaker 1>Case in point now literally forgives </v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of them before stressing the </v>

147
00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:32.991
<v Speaker 1>importance of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness like a tear on a cheek.</v>

148
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for that and then for me when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stand in the rain.</v>

149
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.843
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

150
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I loved you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You loved me the same.</v>

151
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.123
<v Speaker 1>That's all</v>

152
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.840
<v Speaker 1>the rest is confetti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After Nell,</v>

153
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.423
<v Speaker 1>the father exchanges his life in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to free his children and the group </v>

154
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>escapes having conquered both their </v>
<v Speaker 1>literal and metaphorical ghosts.</v>

155
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>The cranes then go on to lead fulfilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

156
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.553
<v Speaker 1>free of the supernatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve reconciles with his expect and </v>

157
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shirley comes clean with her husband.</v>

158
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Feo throws her gloves away and commits </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a real relationship and luke hits the</v>

159
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:17.634
<v Speaker 1>two years sober mark surrounded by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>siblings in showing us these happy </v>

160
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.864
<v Speaker 1>endings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The haunting of hill house is firmly </v>

161
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>making a statement that there is light </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the darkness,</v>

162
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.323
<v Speaker 1>that trauma can be overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what Steve said about fear </v>

163
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.080
<v Speaker 1>feel to it where we find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot meet halfway and if surrounded</v>

164
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 1>by family or love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we can face it directly.</v>

165
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunting of Hill House?</v>

167
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>
