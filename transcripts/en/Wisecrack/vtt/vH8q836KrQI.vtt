1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporeal,</v>

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>jared again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since destiny two dropped.</v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>We've been grinding over public events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crucible and strikes,</v>

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while playing and amazing thing </v>

5
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.164
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an actual narrative to follow </v>

6
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

7
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>The original had all the gramar cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seriously time for that.</v>

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>This time we get a glimpse into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation of the Games and Agnes,</v>

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.503
<v Speaker 1>and it's not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're binge delusions of grandeur or </v>

10
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>monomaniacal madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

11
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The main villain of destiny two is </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven by the same thing that people run</v>

12
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride and and woken list wisecrack quick</v>

13
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>take on destiny two and as usual </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

14
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>First things first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap.</v>

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Destiny two opens with dominance gall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as Gary Today.</v>

16
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>No one is main is scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it something with a j.</v>

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>The military leader of the cabal and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>crew,</v>

18
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:57.314
<v Speaker 1>the Red Legion assaulting the tower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last real city on earth dominance </v>

19
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and his crew up steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mystical light of the traveler,</v>

20
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.623
<v Speaker 1>a giant planet shape God and kidnap the </v>
<v Speaker 1>travelers speaker who is a prophet of </v>

21
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.364
<v Speaker 1>sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play as a guardian and are now </v>

22
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>screwed because without the travelers </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.073
<v Speaker 1>you've become a mere mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to travel the galaxy to </v>

24
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>restore the travelers light and defeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>

25
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Destiny has always been filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian illusions and </v>

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:24.194
<v Speaker 1>undertones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guardians are corpses brought back </v>

27
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>to life with the travelers light like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian Salvation and resurrection and</v>

28
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.464
<v Speaker 1>the game all but says the travelers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a god that sacrifices itself for the </v>

29
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>greater good of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the crucifixion.</v>

30
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's sacrificed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>

31
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It's ancient enemy and brought light to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ghosts.</v>

32
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>The main character's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guardians of the travelers light may</v>

33
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>as well be the guardians of God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined light,</v>

34
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Aka his heavenly choir of angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it.</v>

35
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.243
<v Speaker 1>Guardian angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This light business is a pretty big </v>

36
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:56.384
<v Speaker 1>theme in destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guardians are literally powered by </v>

37
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you die in destiny two,</v>

38
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>we see your light fades away and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of light?</v>

39
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness still not buying the biblical </v>

40
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider this passage.</v>

41
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Ben spake Jesus again unto them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the light of the world.</v>

42
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Either follow with me shall not walk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness,</v>

43
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.003
<v Speaker 1>but shall have the light of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evil that the traveler fled in the </v>

44
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>original destiny was the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you dive in destiny,</v>

45
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:23.384
<v Speaker 1>you saw the darkness consumed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The loss of light is the central theme </v>

46
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:28.184
<v Speaker 1>in destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Destiny two gets a little more specific </v>

47
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>and borrows heavily from a 340 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>epic poem by John Milton.</v>

48
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.863
<v Speaker 1>Paradise Lost Milton's poem traces the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall of Man and follow Satan on his </v>

49
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:40.394
<v Speaker 1>journey to get revenge on God by </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting his newly created paradise </v>

50
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>and its inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve.</v>

51
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Destiny two seems inspired by one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton's central motifs,</v>

52
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>the juxtaposition of light and dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton's angels are represented as light</v>

53
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 1>because of the goodness and illumination</v>
<v Speaker 1>of God's grace.</v>

54
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.523
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demons are described by a darkness </v>

55
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.823
<v Speaker 1>and their absence of light dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gall in a way plays the role of Satan </v>

56
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.293
<v Speaker 1>who's angel name was Lucifer or Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>for light bearer and goal is pretty </v>

57
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>fixated on sealing the travelers light </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveler,</v>

58
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.853
<v Speaker 1>speaker.</v>

59
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>While the parallels between God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan are intriguing,</v>

60
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty essential to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding who you're fighting.</v>

61
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.153
<v Speaker 1>According to the lead designer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny to Luke Smith Gall is motivated </v>

62
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:24.964
<v Speaker 1>by a sort of inferiority complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gall was an orphan space turtle raised </v>

63
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>to believe that the traveler messed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he chose humanity.</v>

64
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.483
<v Speaker 1>Gol was taught to believe that he is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest thing in the universe since </v>

65
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.784
<v Speaker 1>Nutella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's here because he believes the </v>

66
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.214
<v Speaker 1>traveler and choosing us made the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice and destiny to gall intends to </v>

67
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:45.514
<v Speaker 1>show the traveler the error of its ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be surprising that this is </v>

68
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>also Satan's motivation and paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>

69
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer is pissed that he was skipped </v>
<v Speaker 1>over for that big promotion.</v>

70
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.683
<v Speaker 1>God gave the number two slot to his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he plots to burn down heaven and </v>

71
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>tempt man to turn away from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulpie comparison is pissed.</v>

72
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>The traveler chose the guardians so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks them out of the tower and tries to</v>

73
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.971
<v Speaker 1>bend the traveler to his will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of your God.</v>

74
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>One thing that seems odd about goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation is the console galls,</v>

75
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>adoptive father keeps telling him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop messing around with the speaker and</v>

76
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:28.594
<v Speaker 1>just to take the light what is right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this eventually all kills the </v>

77
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>console and the speaker and takes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

78
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>If he took the light anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell did he kill the console?</v>

79
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Why did he wait so long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is complicated,</v>

80
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:44.824
<v Speaker 1>but to simplify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gol was holding out for recognition is </v>

81
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>seeking affection and love from a God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a messed up way.</v>

82
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Recognition has a long philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

83
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.810
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means for our old friend,</v>

84
00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>advil helm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagle for Hagle.</v>

85
00:04:58.511 --> 00:04:59.344
<v Speaker 1>People desire a self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of consciousness or what some </v>

86
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:03.364
<v Speaker 1>people call subjectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are all sorts of steps that </v>

87
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:06.664
<v Speaker 1>people take to achieve subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognition takes place primarily </v>

88
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>through vision and in order for </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition to occur,</v>

89
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>both subjects need to feel like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another are worthy of recognition.</v>

90
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.523
<v Speaker 1>Most people aren't reassured by a thumbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>up from Charles Manson because it </v>

91
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exactly scream you're doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing,</v>

92
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>but a thumbs up from a role model or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

93
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>well that gives you all the warm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuzzies.</v>

94
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Gall is searching for validation from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he considers to be an equal because</v>

95
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>well goal is basically a god given that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the emperor of the cabal.</v>

96
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.703
<v Speaker 1>Golf motivation for recognition comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fact that he was a runt and an </v>

97
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>orphan who was cast aside and abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>even giant space.</v>

98
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:48.934
<v Speaker 1>Turtles have low self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess dominance hopes that in </v>

99
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:52.054
<v Speaker 1>decimating the Guardian's he will show </v>
<v Speaker 1>the traveler that he's deserving of the </v>

100
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>light and he'll be recognized as a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject worthy of protecting the light.</v>

101
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to do pretty much anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible].</v>

102
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.113
<v Speaker 1>I crucify the speaker in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sweet light or really got like </v>

103
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>immortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll even blow up the sun.</v>

104
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Fourth Gall believes he is worthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the sacrifice that he's gone</v>

105
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>through because the guardians were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked willy nilly in destiny.</v>

106
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>One goal doesn't believe the guardians </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sacrificed anything,</v>

107
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.443
<v Speaker 1>and in a way gall is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guardians were endowed with </v>

108
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.210
<v Speaker 1>immortality at random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any fear of death.</v>

109
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.400
<v Speaker 1>They didn't pull themselves up by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

110
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:38.100
<v Speaker 1>boots or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sort of got lucky.</v>

111
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>We're makes your guardians worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>devotion.</v>

112
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.793
<v Speaker 1>Self sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaker is the face of devotion </v>

113
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.513
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when the speaker tells him that the </v>

114
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:02.214
<v Speaker 1>traveler has never spoken to him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no chance in hell he will </v>

115
00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:09.240
<v Speaker 1>ever get the light golf flips out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills the speaker and takes any way,</v>

116
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.343
<v Speaker 1>even though golf said word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not take the light or a remote </v>

117
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>force too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so would be twisted faith.</v>

118
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.390
<v Speaker 1>It's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That goal becomes the villain of Destin.</v>

119
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Once he killed the console and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker and takes the light.</v>

120
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.973
<v Speaker 1>He rejects the recognition model that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Governs Hegel's ethics and go straight </v>

121
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.360
<v Speaker 1>to thievery and university domination in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full circle moment.</v>

122
00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:40.860
<v Speaker 1>He replicates Satan's biggest sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hubris to believe that he could ever</v>

123
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:44.490
<v Speaker 1>be an equal to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when goal is killed in the last fight</v>

124
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 1>and resurrects as a giant marshmallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>God thing,</v>

125
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.670
<v Speaker 1>he has to ask if the traveler finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes him,</v>

126
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>if he finally sees him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the traveler can't see him.</v>

127
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.050
<v Speaker 1>So there you have a tale of Hubris and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition.</v>

128
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the strong narrative component of</v>

129
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:04.524
<v Speaker 1>destiny too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also love just aimlessly walking </v>

130
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:08.130
<v Speaker 1>around killing stuff and picking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>loot.</v>

131
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I love the microtransactions a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

132
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.473
<v Speaker 1>but what do you guys think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should the game stick to the basics or </v>

133
00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 1>explore more of these themes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future?</v>
