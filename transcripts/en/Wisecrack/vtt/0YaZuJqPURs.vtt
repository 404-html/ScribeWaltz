1
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.423
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we have a much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle on crime now is because we have </v>

2
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>trained the police to be police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That social workers,</v>

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not their job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not educated.</v>

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not their job to a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even role models.</v>

5
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>They have to be like Sergeant Joe Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.594
<v Speaker 1>They won't have time to sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a cup of coffee and Nashawn what's </v>

7
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.634
<v Speaker 1>taking place because we have turned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>police department into a reactive </v>

8
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not proactive.</v>

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.243
<v Speaker 1>So they're racing around going from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine one one call to another nine one </v>

10
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.024
<v Speaker 1>one call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not the kind of policing I </v>

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just the way it is.</v>

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>So if the cops are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive,</v>

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>they can't always sit down and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out who's right,</v>

14
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>who's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their job is lock everyone up,</v>

15
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>take them into the WHO Scow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop shop,</v>

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>and the judge.</v>

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out at arraignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who should it be released?</v>

18
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Who should be incarcerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should be given bail,</v>

19
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:58.584
<v Speaker 1>who should be remanded to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good policing when you have </v>

20
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:02.544
<v Speaker 1>limited resource and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recessionary times where in and no </v>

21
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:10.101
<v Speaker 1>longer any stimulus money to keep cops </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the payroll with less cops in enables</v>

22
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.214
<v Speaker 1>you to do more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's why at this point was </v>

23
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>still able to keep the crime down </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly in a time of recession.</v>

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>But we can only hold out for so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time as we have less and less police and</v>

25
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.694
<v Speaker 1>more and more people taking advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criminal opportunities that are </v>

26
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:27.474
<v Speaker 1>before them.</v>

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The better educated you are,</v>

28
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.823
<v Speaker 1>it just means you have an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a more well healed criminal </v>

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.313
<v Speaker 1>command,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white collar criminal with a number two </v>

30
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.064
<v Speaker 1>pencil and rip off everybody by going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street where the banks are too big </v>

31
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:44.484
<v Speaker 1>to fail and then we bail you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of doing triple life without </v>

32
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:47.724
<v Speaker 1>parole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sticking a gun in somebody's back </v>

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and Robin on a $25 you'll rob them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>$25 million.</v>

34
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:53.214
<v Speaker 1>But you know something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you can read the Wall Street </v>

35
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that an advantage in life now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

37
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.474
<v Speaker 1>it's the basic ability to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and for those that you have </v>

38
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.334
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So learning what life is about now </v>

39
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>nowadays the pension is to have you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>an an academic diploma.</v>

40
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Most people that I've ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including myself,</v>

41
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:18.564
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't have a diploma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked out of high school and not </v>

42
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>going to qualify for an academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diploma.</v>

43
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.413
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to go on to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to get a bs or </v>

44
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:27.804
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is or an fact magnet </v>
<v Speaker 1>coombe loudly cause some of them are </v>

45
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>going to major in having a 44 magnum in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hand.</v>

46
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So they need to be taught skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called technical high school.</v>

47
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.793
<v Speaker 1>It's called in middle school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding out if their adaptability is in </v>

48
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:49.521
<v Speaker 1>the academic world or it's that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoracic and that they like to work with</v>

49
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:50.604
<v Speaker 1>their hands and they'd like to learn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade and then giving them the </v>

50
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to do what it is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to do.</v>

51
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.233
<v Speaker 1>Even charter schools nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not full charter schools is the </v>

52
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.960
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:01.794
<v Speaker 1>it's more focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more disciplined and gives the </v>

54
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>child a better opportunity in the belly </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the beast.</v>

55
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.693
<v Speaker 1>It's not one charter school in America </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's devoted to teaching technical </v>

56
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

57
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>So is everybody going to be a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>collar workers?</v>

58
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.574
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is going to be a go to Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street and become a thief and a </v>

59
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.394
<v Speaker 1>financial institution or a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then tell us how they should reward </v>

60
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>themselves with a bonus because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked so hard.</v>

61
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:21.364
<v Speaker 1>Robbing US morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noon and night with derivatives and </v>

62
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>subprime mortgages and giving out loans </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people who have no income,</v>

63
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>no jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no credit.</v>

64
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I know that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that trump,</v>

65
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>they went to Yale and went to the London</v>
<v Speaker 1>School of Economics.</v>

68
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>They went to wharton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business school.</v>

69
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.460

<v Speaker 1>'em up.</v>

71
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.333
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since we're clearing amount of </v>

72
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:46.744
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kind of nut nate's right and tally </v>
