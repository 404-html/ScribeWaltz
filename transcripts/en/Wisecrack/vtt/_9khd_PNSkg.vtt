1
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So there's two general hypotheses or </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories about the nature of time.</v>

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>One of them will call presentism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>present him presentism.</v>

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>The notion is is that only the present </v>
<v Speaker 1>is real,</v>

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>the past was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future,</v>

5
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>some configuration of the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe will be real.</v>

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>But for now only the president Israel in</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast,</v>

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the posing view is called eternalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal wisdom.</v>

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>We you have the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present and future are all equally meal.</v>

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.473
<v Speaker 1>So that makes the present just an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary point in time or an arbitrary </v>

10
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>moment in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one way to think about this is now is</v>

11
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:49.241
<v Speaker 1>to time as here is to space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the same sense that I happen to be</v>

12
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:50.294
<v Speaker 1>here and some viewers are out at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other point in space and we're all </v>

13
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:54.704
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with that notion that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>points in space are equally real and </v>

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>eternal wisdom.</v>

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.213
<v Speaker 1>You have to be comfortable with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that other moments in time or as </v>

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>equally real as this moment in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just an arbitrary moment.</v>

17
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.243
<v Speaker 1>So under that view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other moments or that there's </v>

18
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.444
<v Speaker 1>a continuum of moments in time that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially already laid out within the </v>

19
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>universe and that universe in physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the block universe.</v>

20
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.613
<v Speaker 1>So under the block universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to engage in a </v>

21
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:29.201
<v Speaker 1>conversation about time travel because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other moments to go to.</v>

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.133
<v Speaker 1>Not that this doesn't speak to the issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whether the time travel is actually </v>

23
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>applause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible or not,</v>

24
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:35.024
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it enables the conversation because </v>

25
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.213
<v Speaker 1>other moments in time exists now under </v>
<v Speaker 1>presentism we can pretty much take the </v>

26
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.823
<v Speaker 1>possibility of time travel off the table</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no other moments to go </v>

27
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the president is real.</v>

28
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.343
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't make sense to ask if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can travel to moments in time in the </v>

29
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>past or future that don't exist.</v>

30
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a clash here between </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience and physics.</v>

31
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>So intuitively the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time seems to be changing.</v>

32
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>We humans experience the flow of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.093
<v Speaker 1>under eternal ISM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where everything is already laid </v>

34
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:20.054
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flow of time is a deep mystery </v>

35
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:22.904
<v Speaker 1>because it would seem to be that if all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of moments in time are already laid out </v>

36
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 1>within the block universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the flow of time shouldn't exist or</v>

37
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>must be an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the flow of time,</v>

38
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>if our subjective sense of the flow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is an illusion,</v>

39
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>we have this clash between physics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience because the dominant theory</v>

40
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.313
<v Speaker 1>in physics is that we live in the block </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and there's buy nice should be </v>

41
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no consensus,</v>

42
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.883
<v Speaker 1>there's no a hundred percent agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the standard view in physics is </v>

43
00:02:57.861 --> 00:02:58.694
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this comes large part from </v>

44
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:05.161
<v Speaker 1>relativity that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in an eternal student universe.</v>

45
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the block universe in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

46
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:08.164
<v Speaker 1>present future is equally meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this raises the question of whether </v>

47
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>we can trust our brain to tell us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is flowing.</v>

48
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.153
<v Speaker 1>So I think we need to have a improved </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue between physics and </v>

49
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.034
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on one hand we have to decide is if </v>

50
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.024
<v Speaker 1>we want to accept that are subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of the flow of time is an </v>

51
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>objective fact about the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We perceive time to be flowing.</v>

52
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Things seem to be changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The past seems to be,</v>

53
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaporizing into,</v>

54
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>into the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the future seems to be wide open.</v>

55
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.453
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's the case that we live in the </v>

56
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:55.741
<v Speaker 1>block universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be illusory in a very deep</v>

57
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:56.794
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to decide if we want to take </v>

58
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>our subjective sense of the flow of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an objective fact about the universe.</v>

59
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be explained by physics or in </v>

60
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>contrast is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>our subjective sense of the flow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

62
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Merely an illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an illusion in the deepest sense of that</v>

63
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:17.614
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're perceiving something that </v>

64
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:19.414
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist in the physical world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that physics doesn't need to explain </v>

65
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thus,</v>

66
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.074
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience needs to address where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution comes from and the solution is </v>

67
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>presumably tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>coupled with the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

69
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.993
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
