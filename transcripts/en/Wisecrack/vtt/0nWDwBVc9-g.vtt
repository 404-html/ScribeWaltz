00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.903
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 2>the war on terror construct won't seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that important.</v>

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

4
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 2>when nine slash 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all believed including me,</v>

6
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:28.401
<v Speaker 2>that it would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all that it was a typical event</v>

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 2>like Pearl Harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now,</v>

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem to be the case.</v>

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.003
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and second of all that there would be </v>

10
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 2>many more nine slash 11 or several more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 and there haven't been.</v>

11
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 2>And I hope there aren't basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be a with hindsight,</v>

13
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 2>which is always unfair that people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 2>even though it was by far the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attack in American history,</v>

15
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.583
<v Speaker 2>you have to explain to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren why there was such an </v>

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 2>extreme reaction to one terrorist attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why that,</v>

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to quote unquote change everything </v>

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 2>about American life and America's role </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

19
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that that's what we'll think a</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation from now.</v>

20
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

22
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that this may be more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope,</v>

23
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm right that,</v>

24
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're sitting around with her </v>

25
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:27.034
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of mistrust or the public </v>

26
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 2>sector will seem nutty in how high it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was during this era.</v>
