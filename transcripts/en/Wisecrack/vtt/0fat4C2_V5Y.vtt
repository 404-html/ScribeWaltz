1
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was reviewing a book by a guy named</v>

2
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Mark Mcdonald who teaches at Ucla and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a terrific book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the program era.</v>

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>And the argument of the book is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>American fiction since 1945,</v>

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.483
<v Speaker 1>1950,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been highly influenced by the fact </v>

6
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:26.524
<v Speaker 1>that so many novelists and so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who teach novelists have gone </v>

7
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>through writing programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a take down in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His book,</v>

9
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:36.904
<v Speaker 1>his book basically says that writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs provide a certain environment </v>

10
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:40.954
<v Speaker 1>where a particular kind of fiction gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced and these kinds of fiction are </v>

11
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're often very experimental.</v>

12
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>They take fiction of directions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it wouldn't go.</v>

13
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that everything's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbed down or cookie cuttered.</v>

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that was very provocative </v>

15
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:54.844
<v Speaker 1>and he gave some pretty good readings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary fiction to back up his </v>

16
00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:00.394
<v Speaker 1>claim about it.</v>

17
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>So I would tend to agree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is different.</v>

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a fact of life since 1950 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't true before that,</v>

20
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers had different ways of organizing</v>

21
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.204
<v Speaker 1>themselves and different sort of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>groupings in which to perform their </v>

22
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:17.614
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that many of them go </v>

23
00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:19.654
<v Speaker 1>through the university now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does effect what they write but </v>

24
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're writing is an interesting.</v>

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said in that piece,</v>

26
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:28.084
<v Speaker 1>I myself was a creative writing major in</v>
<v Speaker 1>college and I look back on those </v>

27
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>experiences with great fondness and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they were very good for me too.</v>

28
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a totally appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to have inside the academy.</v>

29
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could say it made it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

30
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it certainly gave me lots of models to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounce off of and learn from.</v>

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>And then part of it is just that I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry and you know,</v>

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>not that many people are into </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary poetry,</v>

33
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but if you can hang out with the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are in your college,</v>

34
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it's really a wonderful thing to share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.833
<v Speaker 1>and I really valued that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm glad I had the opportunity to do </v>

36
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:07.704
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's good thing to good </v>

37
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for students to have.</v>
