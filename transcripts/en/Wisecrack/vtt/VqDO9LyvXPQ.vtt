00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.571
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:04.404
<v Speaker 1>crack jared again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about a film that </v>

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>everyone's loving and nobody's watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blade runner 20,</v>

4
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>49.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central question,</v>

5
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>the original blade runner poses is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us human.</v>

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>The cul continues to meditate on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of this question,</v>

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but instead of retreading the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown,</v>

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.003
<v Speaker 1>it proposes something new that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential to our humanity and how does </v>

9
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:25.054
<v Speaker 1>it do this with holographic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why foods and weird avant garde </v>

10
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome list wise,</v>

11
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>crack quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take our blade runner.</v>

12
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49.</v>

13
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Major spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

14
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:35.494
<v Speaker 1>a recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the events of the original blade </v>

15
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:38.074
<v Speaker 1>runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world freaked out and banned the </v>

16
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>production of replicants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

17
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.024
<v Speaker 1>tensions eventually cool and a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>company starts to produce replicants </v>

18
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that to quote Rick Sanchez has zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance of going blade runner 20,</v>

19
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:49.744
<v Speaker 1>49 follows k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a replicant hunting blade runner and </v>

20
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>replicant himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He discovers the skeleton of a replicant</v>

21
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>that shows signs of having given birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be impossible.</v>

22
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.480
<v Speaker 1>K sent in search of the trial replicant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and discovers the father is a certain Mr</v>

23
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Decker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed by a childhood memory case,</v>

24
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:08.004
<v Speaker 1>suspects that he is deckards miracle </v>
<v Speaker 1>child that would start the replicant </v>

25
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 1>revolution except ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the memory was implanted by deckards</v>

26
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:15.994
<v Speaker 1>real daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confined the reunites with her mean old </v>

27
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 1982 classic largely reflects on how</v>

28
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:21.784
<v Speaker 1>attachment to memories both for mankind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and replicants defines our humanity </v>

29
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.913
<v Speaker 1>replicants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recite poetry and ask all the </v>

30
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:29.014
<v Speaker 1>philosophical questions while we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown debase humans who are all drunk </v>

31
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.454
<v Speaker 1>and disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this serves to further blur the </v>

32
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>distinction between human and replicant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>

33
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:41.794
<v Speaker 1>49 explores this fuzzy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replicant human distinction in another </v>

34
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>way with intimacy and physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection or rather the lack of it.</v>

35
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>The only real relationship k experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>is with his holographic girlfriend.</v>

36
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Joy K tries to make their relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>more real by uploading her to a portable</v>

37
00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:58.354
<v Speaker 1>projector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing her to free roam in one of the </v>

38
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>weirder scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joy projects her image onto a prostitute</v>

39
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>so they can physically touch.</v>

40
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>The desire for intimacy is subtly </v>
<v Speaker 1>implanted all throughout the film.</v>

41
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Neander wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creator of the new replicants,</v>

42
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>must feel and touch everything due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his blindness.</v>

43
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.403
<v Speaker 1>Deckards daughter is locked in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation chamber and unable to touch </v>

44
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:21.094
<v Speaker 1>the holograms that keep her entertained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a recurring motif of </v>

45
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>feeling precipitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'll call it.</v>

46
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Joy going outside for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches out to feel the rain,</v>

47
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.043
<v Speaker 1>but it goes right through her replicants</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear gloves all throughout the film </v>

48
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>until k removes his own to feel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch of falling snow earlier.</v>

49
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Case outstretched hand is covered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bees,</v>

50
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.323
<v Speaker 1>although to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little less sure about what the </v>

51
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:45.724
<v Speaker 1>bees represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also see a group of orphans </v>

52
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>collectively touch k when he shows up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the replicant.</v>

53
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Child and Hologram Elvis sings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take my hand from his song,</v>

54
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>can't help falling in love after deckerd</v>
<v Speaker 1>in KP,</v>

55
00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of each other.</v>

56
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>The film's shot shows decker trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch his daughter,</v>

57
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>but they're obstructed by a glass wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through this,</v>

58
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>the importance of touch and connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>is seen as innately human.</v>

59
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>The second way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

60
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>49 explores the human replicant </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction is in its exploration of how</v>

61
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>memory builds our personal narrative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fallible that is.</v>

62
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.443
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really interesting because </v>

63
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:21.214
<v Speaker 1>whereas the original blade runner showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>replicants making claims to humanity </v>

64
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>with memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

65
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>49 goes further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Implying memories alone aren't enough.</v>

66
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.483
<v Speaker 1>You might remember the bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>post-trauma stress test k has to go </v>

67
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.024
<v Speaker 1>through twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sits in a barren room where a </v>

68
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>disembodied voice keeps saying stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a system of cells while k responds</v>

69
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>with words like interlinked cells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadfully.</v>

70
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>This test has ripped straight from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Nabokov,</v>

71
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.043
<v Speaker 1>book Pale Fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The full excerpt is a system of cells </v>

72
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>interlinked within cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interlinked within cells,</v>

73
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>interlinked within one step and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadfully distinct against the dark.</v>

74
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.703
<v Speaker 1>A Tall White Fountain played later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually see Pale fire in k's </v>

75
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy,</v>

76
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.564
<v Speaker 1>asked him to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The premise of Pale fire is essentially </v>

77
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:04.834
<v Speaker 1>that you've got a poem by a fictional </v>
<v Speaker 1>author being analyzed in the footnotes </v>

78
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:09.904
<v Speaker 1>by a fictional commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book about a commentary about a </v>

79
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:14.870
<v Speaker 1>poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially books,</v>

80
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the whole cells interlinked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passage details are fictional poet.</v>

81
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Having a heart attack and seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of a tall white fountain.</v>

82
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.933
<v Speaker 1>Later in the poem he reads about someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else having a near death experience and </v>

83
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:28.804
<v Speaker 1>seeing the same white fountain convinced</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this shared vision proves the </v>

84
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.094
<v Speaker 1>existence of an afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poet investigates further only to </v>

85
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.904
<v Speaker 1>discover the line was a misprint and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person actually said White Mountain </v>

86
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.613
<v Speaker 1>sensing a theme here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These narratives that we build around </v>

87
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>objects and memories is at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

88
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:46.894
<v Speaker 1>49 discussion on what makes a human case</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory of a wooden horse leads him to </v>

89
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:56.221
<v Speaker 1>believe that he is this miracle child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but surprise he isn't.</v>

90
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>They're not his memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their implants.</v>

91
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Just as the fictional poet of Pale </v>
<v Speaker 1>fires,</v>

92
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>revelation is shattered after realizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white fountain was a misprint.</v>

93
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Kay's revelation is shattered after </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing beat miss imprint of a memory,</v>

94
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.683
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the themes of intimacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and memory combined when he's given the </v>

95
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>choice to help the resistance by killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>deckerd,</v>

96
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>he refuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of trusting his memories,</v>

97
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>he puts his faith in the intimacy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical connection he yearns for.</v>

98
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lets this not memory guide him to his</v>

99
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:31.864
<v Speaker 1>decision to reunite deckerd and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter and just like the original </v>

100
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>blade runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a replicant disobeys,</v>

101
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.473
<v Speaker 1>his programming to save a life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus achieving meaning and maybe even a </v>

102
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is so much more we could say about</v>

103
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>the thematic connections between 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49 and pale fire like parental loss,</v>

104
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the need for memorial or even just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line father time.</v>

105
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>All gray and bent emerged with is uneasy</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>

106
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.213
<v Speaker 1>which sounds lot like deckerd and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>furry companion plus what's up with all </v>

107
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.574
<v Speaker 1>the water imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell imagery there a lot more to </v>

108
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.144
<v Speaker 1>unpack here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let us know what you think in the </v>

109
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.854
<v Speaker 1>comments and maybe we'll do an earthling</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema or a true philosophy up until </v>

110
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

111
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

112
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:14.564
<v Speaker 1>Wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to dive further into blade </v>

113
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>runner 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>

114
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely hit up our </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

115
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Eric and Philip over at the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockstars channel.</v>

116
