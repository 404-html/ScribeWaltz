1
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.043
<v Speaker 1>Roy at the present time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our senses are inadequate to do the </v>

2
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>things you mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>with the addition of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very easy to imagine a time in the</v>

4
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>future when we would have super senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

5
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>our eyeball can only see red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green and blue,</v>

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the primary colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but animals can see different colors.</v>

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

8
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:26.784
<v Speaker 1>can see ultra violet radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the law clumped in the sun </v>

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.043
<v Speaker 1>when it's raining and it's cloudy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that bees would starve to </v>

10
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>death because they don't know where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flower patches wrong.</v>

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.363
<v Speaker 1>They log onto the sun and in under </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultraviolet radiation bees can see the </v>

12
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for us,</v>

13
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't see infrared,</v>

14
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>we can't see ultraviolet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>it is possible that one day we'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact lenses,</v>

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>contact lenses with full internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability.</v>

17
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.483
<v Speaker 1>So we will blink and we will be online </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these contact lenses could be </v>

18
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to infrared or ultraviolet </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation,</v>

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>in which case we could see radiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is invisible to us already.</v>

20
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's possible to get the x ray vision of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superman.</v>

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>If you think of Superman comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

22
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have x Ray Vision.</v>

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You have half a photographic film behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>

24
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>You would have to shine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photograph,</v>

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>shine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x-rays,</v>

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>develop the film to get the x Ray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the person.</v>

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with an eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out we can.</v>

28
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>There's something called backscattered </v>
<v Speaker 1>rays,</v>

29
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>which gives you x Ray Vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allah Superman,</v>

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>almost indistinguishable from the x ray </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of superman comics.</v>

31
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.583
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Get a light bulb that emits x Ray </v>

32
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:48.211
<v Speaker 1>radiation that floods the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the x rays bounce off the walls.</v>

33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Then you put on special goggles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lenses which are sensitive to x,</v>

34
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>x rays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit the wall,</v>

35
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.483
<v Speaker 1>go behind the person's back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through the person and into your </v>

36
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you do it.</v>

37
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Without photographic film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call back scattered x rays.</v>

38
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>It already exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

39
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>because of the nine 11 attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a rush,</v>

40
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>a rush to put backscattered x rays in </v>
<v Speaker 1>airports at the present time.</v>

41
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.373
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already causing civil liberties </v>

42
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits because some people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>their privacy invaded.</v>

43
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't want a superman to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with their x ray vision.</v>

44
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even telepathy,</v>

45
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.643
<v Speaker 1>we have certain forms of telepathy even </v>
<v Speaker 1>today by putting Mri Scans and he eeg </v>

46
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:35.694
<v Speaker 1>scans onto our brainwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can actually appear now into the </v>

47
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>fabric of our own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rather primitive.</v>

48
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a dictionary,</v>

49
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>a dictionary of objects like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

50
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brain patterns.</v>

51
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So by looking at a person's brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern through an Mri,</v>

52
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.803
<v Speaker 1>you can actually tell if the person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at a dog or a cat that exists </v>

53
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.630
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the future,</v>

54
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 1>our vocabulary of maybe 20 pictures may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be increased to a few thousand.</v>

55
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.263
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beginning to look like real </v>

56
00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:09.444
<v Speaker 1>telepathy.</v>
