1
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.233
<v Speaker 1>I'm Anne Marie slaughter and I am the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of </v>

2
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Public and international affairs at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Princeton.</v>

3
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>United States has to operate on two </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracks in the world.</v>

4
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>One is addressing the crises that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>already in the wars that were already in</v>

5
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mistakes we've made.</v>

6
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.633
<v Speaker 1>So closing Guantanamo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signing back up to the Geneva </v>

7
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Conventions for all Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one agenda.</v>

8
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And that agenda is right there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the president's desk and he,</v>

9
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to deal with it and the global </v>

10
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.414
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one track and the president </v>

11
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:52.374
<v Speaker 1>has to be addressing those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time there has to be a </v>

12
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.244
<v Speaker 1>longer term plan just like in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation where you are investing for </v>

13
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>the future where the president says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

14
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next two years,</v>

15
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

16
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>

17
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.643
<v Speaker 1>Here's our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my vision of how America is going to </v>

18
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.754
<v Speaker 1>operate in the global economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a global polity and increasingly </v>

19
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:21.804
<v Speaker 1>global society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are going to exploit the connections </v>

20
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>we've already got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to build them.</v>

21
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>We are going to understand that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants in many ways are our greatest</v>

22
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>assets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are going to lead in a different way.</v>

23
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Where as I talked about strategic </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership,</v>

24
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>we're going to understand that partners </v>
<v Speaker 1>are terrific.</v>

25
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.103
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want partners in every region and we </v>

26
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>want those partners to take the lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can.</v>

27
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Now they're going to be places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>only we can do it and then we have to be</v>

28
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:48.864
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a vision of the United States </v>

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>at the center of a global web connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>taking in the best ideas from all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

31
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>but sending them out whether those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas on foreign policy or on innovation</v>

32
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.024
<v Speaker 1>and products or on green technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ought to be a huge part of what </v>

33
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:06.774
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>

34
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a vision of the United States that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

35
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're reinventing ourselves as a great </v>

36
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>

37
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>We started as a weak power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rose,</v>

38
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:16.944
<v Speaker 1>but we weren't really an imperial power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were a new kind of superpower in the </v>

39
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We created all these institutions.</v>

40
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>We actually cooperated with most other </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations around the world.</v>

41
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to invent ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

42
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to invent ourselves for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a networked world.</v>

43
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep our army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do need our military,</v>

44
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and we do have the ability to send </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops around the world,</v>

45
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to understand that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a small part of the game and probably</v>

46
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>a diminishing part of the game in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the utility of military force,</v>

47
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>and we just like where the country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented the Internet,</v>

48
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>we're going to invent how you lead in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely network</v>

49
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.150
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

50
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
