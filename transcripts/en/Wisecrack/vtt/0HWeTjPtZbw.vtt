00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.893
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to give money away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's the worst thing it </v>

2
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I would look to say the gates </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation,</v>

4
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>which now has 60 billions of dollars to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give away,</v>

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.013
<v Speaker 1>how are they doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're going about it </v>

6
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:24.144
<v Speaker 1>rather wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have put processes in place </v>

7
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.464
<v Speaker 1>and objectives in place and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeting certain things in certain </v>

8
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:32.634
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world that would appear to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be at first some of the lowest hanging </v>

9
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things that,</v>

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be done that might have the </v>

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>greatest leverage for us to move forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things like population growth</v>

12
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.784
<v Speaker 1>and demec disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a corruption and try to apply it in a </v>

13
00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:57.241
<v Speaker 1>ways that the money gets handed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are responsible for it,</v>

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>using techniques that seem to be proven </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be effective.</v>

16
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of billions of dollars have </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been wasted.</v>

17
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Get people giving money away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

18
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>when people say aid doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>that's really not true because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a's does work.</v>

20
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.234
<v Speaker 1>You can just look at some of the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been spent on recently for </v>

21
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.414
<v Speaker 1>eliminating simple things like malaria </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other diseases and there's been a </v>

22
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways too,</v>

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.453
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>how effectively do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly we should learn from that.</v>

25
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of smart people </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on exactly this and there are,</v>

26
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>there would be ways to give away </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000,000,</v>

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>although I'm sure you wouldn't do it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

28
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't do it all at once.</v>
