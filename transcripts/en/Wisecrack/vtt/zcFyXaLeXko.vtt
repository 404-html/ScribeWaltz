00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is spirited away,</v>

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.803
<v Speaker 1>the award winning masterpiece from </v>
<v Speaker 1>legendary animator and confirmed Silver </v>

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How yells a media Xochi.</v>

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>The story opens on a 10 year old human </v>
<v Speaker 1>female named Shahir row and her parental</v>

10
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.804
<v Speaker 1>units as they get lost in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if a human is lost in the woods and </v>

11
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>no one is around to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it register as a sentient life?</v>

12
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.094
<v Speaker 1>Form point is these schmoes accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>stumbled their way into a magical land </v>

13
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>filled with delicious food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's by none.</v>

14
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.654
<v Speaker 1>Get a million free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents start stuffing it down </v>

15
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:57.954
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gullets and lose their kosher status </v>

16
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>faster than you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

17
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.383
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To hero does what any child would do in </v>

18
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>this situation and abandons her porky </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents to go beef up her resume.</v>

19
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Could you give me a job please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

20
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.003
<v Speaker 2>I just want to,</v>

21
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.163
<v Speaker 1>after much haranguing a wrinkly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old cronut named you Baba hires to hero </v>

22
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:21.634
<v Speaker 1>to work in her bath house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but changes her name to send as a show </v>

23
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:25.234
<v Speaker 1>of bad faith and so made this dreamboat </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haku warned said not to forget her real </v>

24
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.114
<v Speaker 1>name like he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or else it can cause a real headache at </v>

25
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:34.324
<v Speaker 1>the DMV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You name a stink spirit arrives at the </v>

26
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>bath house around mid same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It usually arrives for me.</v>

27
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Send cleans them successfully and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thank her,</v>

28
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>the Spirit bestows upon her the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift of all,</v>

29
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>a little Turd and fused with IPECAC </v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

30
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>A guy named no face pays for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>food with gold,</v>

31
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the very foundation of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactional ecosystem,</v>

32
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't really seem like much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

33
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Why is everyone screaming soon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets poisoned and Oh,</v>

34
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.524
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also a dragon now sometimes saying </v>

35
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>gives them part of that Turd to crunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

36
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>which makes him bark off a shiny little </v>
<v Speaker 1>egg mcmuffin while she's at it.</v>

37
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.193
<v Speaker 1>She gives the rest of the term to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>face just to see how much barfing is </v>

38
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>allowed in a pg movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out it's a metric ass load.</v>

39
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send visit Zinni.</v>

40
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara,</v>

41
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>his twin sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give back the mcguffin.</v>

42
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Haikus stole during the breakfast rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an informed sen that it was her love for</v>

43
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>her coup that broke some cursor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another which is gross because sin is 10</v>

44
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.673
<v Speaker 1>and Huck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's gotta be at least 18 backoff </v>

45
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.423
<v Speaker 1>creep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are plenty of other fish in the </v>

46
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>sea monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

47
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.763
<v Speaker 1>completely unprompted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send remembers a time she fell into the </v>

48
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] River,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they arbitrarily decide means that</v>

49
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 1>huck who is short for Co Haku and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>river spirit,</v>

50
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.970
<v Speaker 1>so he's like a thousand and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is even more inappropriate.</v>

51
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Shame on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

52
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You Baba gives sen last pop quiz where </v>
<v Speaker 1>she has to identify your parents,</v>

53
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but sen wasn't born yesterday.</v>

54
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

55
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.843
<v Speaker 1>sin was born yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Shahir wasn't none of these gigs or </v>

56
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:15.181
<v Speaker 1>my mom or dad and now that she's a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

57
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>it's time to grab her rehumanized </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and blow this popsicle store.</v>

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.473
<v Speaker 1>Spirited away is a coming of age story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tradition of classics like Tim </v>

59
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Burton's Alice in Wonderland and James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Franco's the wizard of Oz,</v>

60
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>which similarly portray a young girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>transported to a strange place where she</v>

61
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.044
<v Speaker 1>asked to do a bunch of stuff at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start of the film to hero is naive and </v>

62
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>inexperienced with a dash of timid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiny,</v>

63
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>sprinkled in for good measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look to euro.</v>

64
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.453
<v Speaker 1>There's your new school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is only by solving problems and </v>

65
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:48.814
<v Speaker 1>helping those in need that you hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>gains the self reliance and empathy </v>

66
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.834
<v Speaker 1>needed to terrorize a giant baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Underneath this story of renewal and </v>

67
00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>vomiting lurks a cautionary tale of </v>
<v Speaker 1>greed and overconsumption,</v>

68
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.413
<v Speaker 1>particularly as it relates to post war </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan after the shall we say messy end </v>

69
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>of World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan experienced an economic boom,</v>

70
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.683
<v Speaker 1>no offense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non taken that correlated with a </v>

71
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>cultural shift toward capitalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from traditional values.</v>

72
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.223
<v Speaker 1>The spirit realm takes the form of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>old amusement park styled after the </v>

73
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Meiji period of the late 19th and early </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>

74
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>which are two of my all time favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries discarded trines.</v>

75
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.713
<v Speaker 1>Adorn the hillside symbolizing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relegation of cultural history in favor </v>

76
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>of more modern pursuits like leisure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interdimensional slipstreams.</v>

77
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>In this economically driven environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overconsumption has dire consequences,</v>

78
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>much like the type you might find in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prenup to heroes,</v>

79
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>parents snarfed down food from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit realm,</v>

80
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>despite its obviously suspicious lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>

81
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got Daddy,</v>

82
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>he's got credit cards and cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In return.</v>

83
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:57.424
<v Speaker 1>They are transformed into pigs which are</v>
<v Speaker 1>commonly used on earth as a critical </v>

84
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.324
<v Speaker 1>symbol of capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures that would bring about the </v>

85
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 1>eradication of humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all folks.</v>

86
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The bathhouse furnace has also shaped </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pig constantly gobbling resources</v>

87
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>just to give guests a slightly more </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperate bubble bath.</v>

88
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>When no face shows up overflowing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold,</v>

89
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.633
<v Speaker 1>you Baba and our workers milk that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proverbial horse for every last fluid </v>

90
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the staff showers,</v>

91
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>no face and access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't help but shower them in stomach</v>

92
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:28.594
<v Speaker 1>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film expresses hope that modern </v>

93
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:31.054
<v Speaker 1>Japan can find a balance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic prosperity and spiritual </v>

94
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:35.374
<v Speaker 1>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There as much emphasis on remembering </v>

95
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>one's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you completely forget it,</v>

96
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you'll never find your way home and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity of one's parents look hard.</v>

97
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you to remember which ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

98
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>and even though I forget both of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things on a daily basis,</v>

99
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:49.384
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are important in forging a </v>

100
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>connection to one's ancestry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The message deepens when we consider the</v>

101
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>context of the film prior to making </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirited away.</v>

102
00:05:58.101 --> 00:05:58.934
<v Speaker 1>Director Hio Miyazaki was considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>passing the torch to the next wave of </v>

103
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.044
<v Speaker 1>artists at studio Ghibli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though he reconsidered when he </v>

104
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>remembered he was the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

105
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>at the time when many animated films </v>
<v Speaker 1>were visualized using computers,</v>

106
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.123
<v Speaker 1>spirited away was drawn using an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate system of levers and pulleys </v>

107
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.233
<v Speaker 1>and it story conveys the hope that </v>
<v Speaker 1>future generations will flourish and </v>

108
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>progress while at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting the history of the art form,</v>

109
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For earthlink.</v>

110
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Cinema,</v>

111

<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jared,</v>

113
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:35.440
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like many youtubers,</v>

114
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.333
<v Speaker 3>we often get asked what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications we use to make our videos </v>

115
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 3>and how we learn to use them and why is </v>
