1
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.183
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most dangerous in human </v>

2
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.224
<v Speaker 1>impulses is at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that you can start from </v>

3
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

4
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>this is an idea that has come up again </v>
<v Speaker 1>and again in history,</v>

5
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.434
<v Speaker 1>I almost called my book blank is </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful because it seemed to be this </v>

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.633
<v Speaker 1>recurring idea that was at the root of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dream of transformation through </v>

7
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>disaster transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through shock,</v>

8
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.364
<v Speaker 1>through violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think by any means that the </v>

9
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>right or the who are the market </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalists have,</v>

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>are the only ones who think this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the indicator species for a</v>

11
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>dangerous ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>it's the year zero mentality of a pol </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot or the desire for a blankness,</v>

13
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>some cleaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slate of Mal,</v>

14
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you hear it from the Donald </v>

15
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Rumsfeld's and the Chinese as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you can create a country,</v>

16
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>a model country in somebody else's land.</v>

17
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the same dream of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

18
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>of total power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total creation.</v>

19
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

20
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the colonial dream as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a and M.</v>

21
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.103
<v Speaker 1>I think we are in denial that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep part of our history here in North </v>

22
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dream of starting over,</v>

23
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.804
<v Speaker 1>of rebooting the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded in some of our most </v>

24
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.584
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian biblical myths of the </v>

25
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.903
<v Speaker 1>great floods and great fires and just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gang of us and our friends being saved </v>

26
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>and getting to start over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Noah's Ark and the rapture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

29
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazingly seductive idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you can reboot the world,</v>

31
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>start from zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazingly anti human idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think we need to understand that because</v>

33
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it can be framed as a really idealistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>

34
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will,</v>

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>we want utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds good.</v>

36
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

37
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>we know how to build it up.</v>

38
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with this dream is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get in the way,</v>

39
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to clean the slate.</v>

40
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.334
<v Speaker 1>You have to wipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wipe the slate clean because there are </v>

41
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:18.584
<v Speaker 1>no empty lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the violence of </v>

42
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>colonialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been the most.</v>

43
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>It is the most powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most dangerous idea.</v>

44
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It crosses political lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It crosses religious lines,</v>

45
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

46
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

47
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the ideology that has rationalized</v>

48
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the great cleansings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great genocides,</v>

49
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.503
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to identify it as a </v>

50
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:44.864
<v Speaker 1>dangerous ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to understand it in our history </v>

51
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>so that we don't repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.580
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to counter it with something</v>

53
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of my philosophy,</v>

54
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:56.204
<v Speaker 1>I try try sort of developing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is the opposite of starting </v>

55
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>from scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is starting from scrap.</v>

56
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think this,</v>

57
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:06.604
<v Speaker 1>this idea that we see that there will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some moment when we get to start from </v>

58
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.090
<v Speaker 1>scratch.</v>

59
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.120
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to,</v>

60
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.850
<v Speaker 1>to excise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no empty lands,</v>

62
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>there are no blank slates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no clean sheet.</v>

63
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>There's always gonna be people there who</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with you.</v>

64
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to have to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>from compromise.</v>

65
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

66
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time I interviewed William Gibson </v>

67
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>who's a wonderful science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>

68
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>or he doesn't only write science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

69
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was talking to them about science </v>

70
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.524
<v Speaker 1>fiction writing and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that there's sort of two </v>

71
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

72
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.053
<v Speaker 1>the people who believe that the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>is shiny and the people who know that </v>

73
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the future is rusty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

75
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.843
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the shiny science fiction writers </v>

76
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>that you have to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

78
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the future is going to be rusty.</v>

80
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.523
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be built by </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's around and whatever's left </v>

81
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:00.154
<v Speaker 1>behind and it'll be this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>patchwork and we just need to resign </v>

82
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

83
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:05.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we leave,</v>

84
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.693
<v Speaker 1>we leave big messes behind and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to start from scrap and </v>

85
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>stopped dreaming of starting from </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch because it's,</v>

86
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a very violent idea and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

87
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>But the flip side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that clean slate idea is the scorched</v>

88
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.384
<v Speaker 1>earth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the scorched earth we're seeing in </v>

89
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.414
<v Speaker 1>Iraq right?</v>
