1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that troubles me the most,</v>

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 2>they here in the country is it we become</v>
<v Speaker 2>so partisan.</v>

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.593
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first joined the </v>

5
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 2>congress way back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1980,</v>

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a rule,</v>

7
00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:22.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the partisanship stops at the water's </v>

8
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:24.131
<v Speaker 2>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's blown,</v>

9
00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 2>that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a time in that,</v>

11
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 2>in that history when I joined the </v>
<v Speaker 2>congress,</v>

12
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:30.754
<v Speaker 2>when one party has such a commanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence in the Congress or the other </v>

13
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>never even thought about gaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got along now they both realize they </v>

15
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>can control things if they just destroy </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other sufficiently.</v>

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

17
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 2>the lesson of the Republican takeover of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house was it,</v>

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:48.874
<v Speaker 2>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could tear down institutions so </v>

20
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 2>dramatically in the eyes of the American</v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

21
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you can take it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

22
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 2>that's been repeated now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last election cycle.</v>

24
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And it will be repeated again if </v>
<v Speaker 2>partisanship is,</v>

25
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 2>is so important in this country that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

26
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 2>that people are willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 2>to just attack each other rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate each other's ideas.</v>

28
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.853
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a better tutorial I think in </v>

29
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>one of the news magazines going way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

30
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I remember I talked about the impact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>television and negative campaigning upon</v>

31
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 2>the politics of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

32
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I made the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.273
<v Speaker 2>television was such a powerful entity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you combined it with negative </v>

34
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:32.374
<v Speaker 2>campaigning and negative advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could wreck some pretty significant </v>

35
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 2>damage to our system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's happened.</v>

36
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Like they pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 2>if Mcdonald's and Burger King had run </v>
<v Speaker 2>ads for 10 years on television,</v>

38
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 2>not talking about how good that product </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

39
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.360
<v Speaker 2>but how awful the other guys' products </v>
<v Speaker 2>were and I'm rotten and disease causing,</v>

40
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>

41
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't be choosing among brands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would,</v>

42
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.163
<v Speaker 2>we would be the hamburgers anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point that the article made was </v>

43
00:01:58.811 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 2>we're reaching a stage where we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing between candidates anymore.</v>

45
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.593
<v Speaker 2>We're turning off on the whole system </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Americans today a turning off </v>

46
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 2>dramatically on the two parties and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

47
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reputation of congress is an all </v>

48
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 2>time low presidencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reputation is at an all time low,</v>

49
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driven in large part by a willingness to</v>

50
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 2>attack each other rather than the debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ideas as civilized human beings.</v>

51
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.913
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

52
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 2>and I think we face a real danger here </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

53
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:30.784
<v Speaker 2>If it continues at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for the institutions of our </v>

54
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.250
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.203
<v Speaker 2>either has to recover or this old time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower experiencing is going to pull it </v>

56
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

57
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 2>and who knows what we get in its place?</v>

58
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

59
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.034
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an easy recipe and that is your </v>

60
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 2>recipe is to turn out anybody who plays </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative politics and,</v>

61
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.973
<v Speaker 2>and start insisting that candidates </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak positively about each other and </v>

62
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.180
<v Speaker 2>about their ideas and debate the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

63
00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the national press could,</v>

64
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>could help with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But obviously,</v>

65
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody likes a good fight.</v>

66
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 2>So instead we like negative politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as much as people say they don't </v>

67
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>like him and you check with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollsters,</v>

68
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 2>they work there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

69
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.053
<v Speaker 2>they literally help elect candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can make you believe the other </v>

70
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>guy's worse than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get your vote.</v>

71
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta,</v>

72
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 2>we gotta recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ain't good for the country.</v>

73
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.873
<v Speaker 2>We've got to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to literally start rewarding </v>

74
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 2>positive politics in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

75
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 2>we've got to start rewarding those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were willing to reach out across the,</v>

76
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:37.794
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the chasm and work </v>

77
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 2>together that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>there are fewer and fewer people brave </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to do that in America.</v>

79
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 2>We've got to start rewarding them when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that.</v>

80
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.573
<v Speaker 2>We've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to say to the Joe Lieberman </v>

81
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:50.944
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to penalize you because </v>

82
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you're reached across the aisle and work</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

83
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.233
<v Speaker 2>with Republicans on something that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>important or to say the conservative </v>

84
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:59.374
<v Speaker 2>Democrats that you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>penalized because you worked with </v>

85
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party Republicans who reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the aisle and work with Democrats</v>

86
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 2>on a health care issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>

87
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>we've got to start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

88
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 2>That's not only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

89
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>that's good and we can't let the parties</v>
<v Speaker 2>run the show.</v>
