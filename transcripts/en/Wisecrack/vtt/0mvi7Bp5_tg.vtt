1
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we will probably need some </v>

2
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>new institutional arrangements before </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is over.</v>

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that I've called for,</v>

4
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:17.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

5
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:18.784
<v Speaker 1>in a number of places including my book </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a world environment </v>

6
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked in the UN,</v>

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>if you look across the landscape of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UN agencies,</v>

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably true that the weakest ones</v>

10
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that are there for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good.</v>

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>We need a world environment organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has the kind of authority and clout</v>

13
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>that the World Trade Organization has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an easy case to make.</v>

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

15
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:51.834
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the World Bank could have a big </v>

16
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could create special arrangements and</v>

17
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>special facilities to help deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues.</v>

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And the best thing about the UN program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>are in this area are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the,</v>

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.373
<v Speaker 1>is not appreciated that widely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of the international treaties </v>

22
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>that worked to protect the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>most of which the US has never ratified </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

24
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but all of those treaties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>are sponsored by the United Nations.</v>

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.553
<v Speaker 1>The these negotiations that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year to strengthen the climate </v>

27
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now looking to a post Kyoto Protocol,</v>

28
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out to 20,</v>

29
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>50 to reduce greenhouse gases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

30
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

31
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.543
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.473
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is under the Framework Convention on </v>

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Climate Change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a UN sponsored exercise.</v>

35
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And the secretary at sit service those </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions and it's sponsored.</v>

36
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>The negotiations are UN entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>and problem is that that system doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work nearly well enough.</v>

38
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

39
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a one country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one vote,</v>

40
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.333
<v Speaker 1>a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a country's can whittle down these </v>

41
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>agreements to the point that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>toothless.</v>

42
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.673
<v Speaker 1>And the real problem now is not the poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not weakened forcement of the </v>

43
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>treaties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

44
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not weak compliance with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>treaties.</v>

45
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a treaty.</v>

46
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:22.614
<v Speaker 1>So toothless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't require much in the first </v>

47
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:24.984
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we need to develop some new </v>

48
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>machinery for international </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations.</v>
