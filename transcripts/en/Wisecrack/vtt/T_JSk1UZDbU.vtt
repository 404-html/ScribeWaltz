<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three dimensional jared here.</v>

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.923
<v Speaker 1>The first three seasons of bojack showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>us a protagonist that despite his </v>

5
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled to find meaning.</v>

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.633
<v Speaker 1>Buck season three ended with hope bojack</v>
<v Speaker 1>runs away from La and stairs that or </v>

7
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>heard of galloping horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially embracing the idea that he's</v>

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.323
<v Speaker 1>free to choose who he wants to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to the core of the new </v>

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.183
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ability to define and redefine our </v>

10
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:34.914
<v Speaker 1>own narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woken lists very late wisecrack quick </v>

11
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>take on bojack horseman season four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.333
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrapped up in this season is what I'm </v>

13
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:44.364
<v Speaker 1>going to call the narrative self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that how we experience things and </v>

14
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.444
<v Speaker 1>remember things are intricately wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the stories we tell about </v>

15
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As philosopher Michael Geza,</v>

16
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Niga says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're natural storytellers.</v>

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>After the brain computes and event the </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusory we,</v>

18
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>that is the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes aware of it.</v>

19
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.143
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we think and understand the </v>

20
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>world and ourselves is literally through</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.723
<v Speaker 1>series creator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raphael Bob Waxford has spoken about </v>

22
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:11.784
<v Speaker 1>this idea of self narrative and bojack </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the narrative we've </v>

23
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've kind of internalize this idea that</v>

24
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:17.934
<v Speaker 1>we're working towards some great ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that if we put all our ducks in a </v>

25
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>row will be rewarded and everything will</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally make sense.</v>

26
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a struggle and we're all trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out,</v>

27
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and these characters are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out for themselves.</v>

28
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.593
<v Speaker 1>This struggle to redefine one's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative is integrally bound up with </v>

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.283
<v Speaker 1>each character's happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone moves closer towards happiness </v>

30
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:37.974
<v Speaker 1>as they move further away from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Escaping the death of Sarah Lynn bojack </v>

31
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>drives to his family summer home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to redefine his own narrative that</v>

32
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.134
<v Speaker 1>he's a person who tries to be a handyman</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can't fix anything before later </v>

33
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>recasting himself as a tragic hero who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack horseman,</v>

34
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>who's bojack Horseman.</v>

35
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>He's a very famous TV and film star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he was,</v>

36
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.203
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he gave it all up for a life of </v>

37
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.554
<v Speaker 1>quiet anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of making any real inroads into </v>

38
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:04.614
<v Speaker 1>redefining his own character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack ends up reliving the past that </v>

39
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:07.974
<v Speaker 1>justifies his own self-loathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the wildest show overlap the </v>

40
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>narrative of his mother's abusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

41
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>A cycle continued as she raised bojack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.773
<v Speaker 1>Jack's life turns around when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>befriends a dragon fly named Eddie who </v>

43
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>refuses to fly following his wife's </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt,</v>

44
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.583
<v Speaker 1>but after Eddie tries to kill them both </v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack season Eddie's fixation on the </v>

45
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:26.454
<v Speaker 1>past as a cautionary tale about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounding your narrative and a longing </v>

46
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>for the past can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next day in typical bojack style,</v>

47
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>he hires a wrecking crew to level the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugarman house.</v>

48
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

49
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You think I just want to mope around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a shrine to the past,</v>

50
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.913
<v Speaker 1>getting off of my own guilt while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life passes me by authentic </v>

51
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:44.544
<v Speaker 1>much Princess Carolyn struggles to </v>
<v Speaker 1>redefine the family narrative that she </v>

52
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>can do it all on her own as she tries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get pregnant.</v>

53
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't need other options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother had 12 kids.</v>

54
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>My body was made for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got to keep tip.</v>

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.133
<v Speaker 1>There's even a whole episode framed as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation by Princess Carolyn's </v>

56
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>future descendant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is actually just a story.</v>

57
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Princess Carolyn tells herself to cope </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the president.</v>

58
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
<v Speaker 1>She used her current hardships as what </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher war freeman called Frodo </v>

59
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a story yet to happen.</v>

60
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.073
<v Speaker 1>It's the ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens next that gives these </v>

61
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>moments meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

62
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.353
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever hear the story of the </v>

63
00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:23.850
<v Speaker 1>couple have moved to California?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say,</v>

64
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a marvelous adventure.</v>

65
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.860
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hardly knew each other,</v>

66
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but they shared a certain sensitivity at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tastes for the unknown.</v>

67
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.963
<v Speaker 1>They were living in a one horse town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they headed west towards a town that </v>

68
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:37.100
<v Speaker 1>could accommodate three horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

69
00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I have heard this story.</v>

70
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I got a small house in San Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 1>near the bookstore,</v>

71
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>except she doesn't know what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

72
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.643
<v Speaker 1>so in order to cling to the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative that she'll be fine and </v>

73
00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 1>fertile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she invents her own ending,</v>

74
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.183
<v Speaker 1>and when I think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about how everything's going to </v>

75
00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:54.584
<v Speaker 1>work out because how else could you tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>people what the show tells us that this </v>

76
00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>narrative is misguided as symbolized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>her cherished family necklace that turns</v>

77
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>out to be nothing more than worthless </v>
<v Speaker 1>costume jewelry.</v>

78
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Season four offers a solution to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ailments.</v>

79
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.970
<v Speaker 1>In what Michael White and David Epston </v>
<v Speaker 1>called narrative therapy.</v>

80
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.013
<v Speaker 1>The point is to help patients re author </v>
<v Speaker 1>their identity by focusing on what they </v>

81
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>value and then creating a narrative that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will help them pursue those values.</v>

82
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.693
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere is this more apparent than in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack must learn to overcome the </v>

83
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:26.090
<v Speaker 1>narrative that he's a terrible person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in regards to Holly Hawk.</v>

84
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.043
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time she looks at me with </v>

85
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:29.504
<v Speaker 2>those big innocent eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I can think about is every thing </v>

86
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I've ever done and I think I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve that kind of love.</v>

87
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>We actually get to hear bojack self </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative through his inner monologue,</v>

88
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.113
<v Speaker 2>your real stupid pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know I'm a piece of that at least </v>

89
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:45.080
<v Speaker 2>makes me better than all the pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't know are pieces of it.</v>

90
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Making things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bojack's forced to live with his abusive</v>

91
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:49.280
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beatrice,</v>

92
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 1>even though bojack's no longer living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shrine to the past,</v>

93
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>still logging for the love of a mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't recognize him.</v>

94
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>When bojack inevitably does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

95
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.143
<v Speaker 1>it just viciously perpetuates this </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative narrative starting the cycle </v>

96
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

97
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:04.934
<v Speaker 1>bojack may have finally broken the cycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he owns up to his actions with </v>

98
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.713
<v Speaker 1>hollyhock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are an amazing woman and after </v>

99
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:11.264
<v Speaker 1>Beatrice Laces hollyhocks coffee with </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded means bojack lets it go rather </v>

100
00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 1>than perpetuating this multigenerational</v>
<v Speaker 1>tale of abuse and revenge.</v>

101
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.633
<v Speaker 1>When Beatrice finally recognizes Bojack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stops looking for validation that </v>

102
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:23.654
<v Speaker 1>will fix the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sees her as she is a sickly old </v>

103
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:29.720
<v Speaker 1>lady and in the least bojack moment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life,</v>

104
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>he's kind to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He don't understand.</v>

105
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>You're in Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>

106
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the lake house it.</v>

107
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a warm summer night in.</v>

108
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.083
<v Speaker 1>The fireflies are dancing in the sky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole family is here and they're </v>

109
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>telling you that everything is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be all right.</v>

110
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.003
<v Speaker 1>In a final act of selflessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lets hollyhocks eight dad's tell her </v>

111
00:05:59.121 --> 00:05:59.954
<v Speaker 1>that bojack is actually her brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of claiming the good deed for </v>

112
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a reward,</v>

113
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>bojack gains something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you from the beginning,</v>

114
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I have eight dad's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

115
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never had a brother.</v>

116
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess Carolyn tells us the stories we</v>

117
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>tell ourselves aren't always real.</v>

118
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.540
<v Speaker 3>I got into this business because I love </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

119
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.090
<v Speaker 3>They comfort us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they inspire us,</v>

120
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.240
<v Speaker 3>they create a context for how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience the world,</v>

121
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.440
<v Speaker 3>but also you have to be careful because </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you spend a lot of time with stories,</v>

122
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.440
<v Speaker 3>you start to believe that life is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and it's not.</v>

123
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Life is life,</v>

124
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.983
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can people really change themselves by </v>

125
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:44.764
<v Speaker 1>changing their own narratives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you think in the </v>

126
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:47.464
<v Speaker 1>comments section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as bojack is reshaping what an </v>

127
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 1>animated Sitcom can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intel is doing the same for storytelling</v>

<v Speaker 1>speck in the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired by the iconic Pale blue dot </v>
