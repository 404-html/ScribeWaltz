00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 2>so when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're fascinated with your election,</v>

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 2>hillary and trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodness,</v>

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 2>and everybody that you talk to says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.153
<v Speaker 2>how is trump being so successful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why on earth are people tolerating </v>

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 2>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a good answer for it.</v>

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.893
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a piece recently for time and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed why trump is having the sort </v>

9
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:46.371
<v Speaker 2>of success that he's having at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and it comes down to one thing.</v>

10
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Trump is a troll that has jumped off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet and into the real world and the</v>

11
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:55.524
<v Speaker 2>reason that so many people are tolerant </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his extreme statements is name </v>

12
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:04.734
<v Speaker 2>calling this horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty even stood sadistic behavior is </v>

13
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:15.681
<v Speaker 2>because the online environment has </v>
<v Speaker 2>normalized this type of behavior</v>

14
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.033
<v Speaker 2>in cyber psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pointed out that what happens in the </v>

15
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.244
<v Speaker 2>cyber world impacts on the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens in the real world impacts </v>

16
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.893
<v Speaker 2>on the cyber world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is certainly true in terms of </v>

17
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 2>trump's behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great study titled Trolls.</v>

18
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.653
<v Speaker 2>Just want to have fun and you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>read this because it talks about the </v>

19
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>dark tetrad of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The study found that people who say that</v>

20
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.434
<v Speaker 2>they like to troll actually score high </v>
<v Speaker 2>on an an index that measures </v>

21
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.483
<v Speaker 2>machiavellianism and index that measures</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic traits and index that </v>

22
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 2>measures narcissistic traits and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

23
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 2>and the study found that trolling was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of everyday sadism.</v>

24
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And election aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's important,</v>

25
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 2>but I'm more concerned about a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

26
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 2>The issue is that people like me spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>our time trying to teach kids to be nice</v>

27
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:30.234
<v Speaker 2>to each other online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very hard for us to win that </v>

28
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:34.584
<v Speaker 2>battle when politicians use cruelty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sadism as a strategy and appear to gain </v>

29
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 2>ground because of it.</v>

30
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So cyberspace is an environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's somewhere where you go.</v>

31
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 2>It's an immersive environment chatroom </v>
<v Speaker 2>forum.</v>

32
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.313
<v Speaker 2>It's a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens there is that behavior </v>

33
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>can become normalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as human beings,</v>

34
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.660
<v Speaker 2>we're social creatures and we learn from</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

35
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>So for peers that everybody is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

36
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.880
<v Speaker 2>it can seem that it's okay and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>become very difficult with the pervasive</v>

37
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.514
<v Speaker 2>penetration and accessibility of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet to draw the line between </v>

38
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 2>something that's in evolving behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's become almost a social norm.</v>

39
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.103
<v Speaker 2>And sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>online trolling has become almost a </v>

40
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:30.994
<v Speaker 2>social norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when that behavior cyber </v>

41
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.094
<v Speaker 2>migrates into the real world and trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way he behaves is a classic </v>

42
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>example of cyber like ration.</v>
