00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.593
<v Speaker 1>My name is Graham Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>founder of tree hugger and Interactive </v>

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Planet Green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From,</v>

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>from here we all but now we're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal and in the woods.</v>

4
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.503
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very much shaped sort of </v>

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 2>where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I ended up.</v>

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.923
<v Speaker 2>So my parents were hippies and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>the community around there and my </v>

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.340
<v Speaker 2>parents' friends were largely people </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of getting back to the land.</v>

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I lived in a log house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot about sort of conservation</v>

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.253
<v Speaker 1>and nature from my child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents certainly did help it vary a </v>

10
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 2>They're very green in the own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother is a vegetarian,</v>

12
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>has been for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years and I certainly remember many</v>

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>lessons of conservation from my father </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a more general sense.</v>

14
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:05.321
<v Speaker 2>My stepfather was very inspirational and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he just helped me believe in myself</v>

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 2>and just believed that I could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I wanted to do and that I was a</v>

16
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:11.864
<v Speaker 2>special person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he was very influential and then </v>

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.063
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly some great teachers along the </v>

18
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

19
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 2>my childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.343
<v Speaker 2>later on it was more books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I used to read fiction back </v>

21
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was sort of different.</v>

22
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I can remember.</v>

23
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:28.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it,</v>

24
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly was a very much a bookworm.</v>

25
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>I loved reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they inspired me in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>

27
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.923
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it's our creativity later </v>

28
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 2>on was more more books like a Gandhi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found very inspiring.</v>

29
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:45.924
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his is a biography or autobiography and </v>

30
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 2>certainly books regarding green </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding evolution,</v>

31
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 2>like a beak of the finch by Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wiener,</v>

32
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 2>natural capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.563
<v Speaker 2>by the 11th</v>

34
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>and Paul Hawkin both very inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me from my parents,</v>

35
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think I was always somewhat</v>

36
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 2>conscious of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious of it,</v>

37
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.284
<v Speaker 2>but really it was only a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was vegetarian for quite a long </v>

38
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.264
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've certainly lived in terms of live </v>

39
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 2>with less sometimes due to finances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it really was,</v>

40
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.383
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of later on though is the </v>

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 2>sort of mid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mid twenties to late twenties.</v>

42
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I really started thinking about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading about it and,</v>

43
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.063
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

44
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 2>and getting more concerned about how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived and what</v>

45
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.760
<v Speaker 1>back I might have with the businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I might create.</v>

46
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I always thought I'd be an adventure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

47
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what I became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

48
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.743
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>

49
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm a creator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to,</v>

50
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I like to build things and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that basically is what an adventure is.</v>

51
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I do some products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do some media.</v>

52
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I could do various things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really ultimately I'm an inventor.</v>
