<v Speaker 1>we wanted to break down numero uno and </v>

5
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>ask what does it all mean just like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>older brother,</v>

6
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:18.824
<v Speaker 1>grand theft auto grand theft horse takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a satirical look at American culture </v>

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>despite being set over a hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.903
<v Speaker 1>but above all else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red dead redemption is a commentary on </v>

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.483
<v Speaker 1>our relationship to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if civilization was even worth all </v>

10
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.024
<v Speaker 1>the trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So saddle up for this wisecrack edition </v>

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.633
<v Speaker 1>on the satire of Red Dead Redemption and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course spoilers ahead for a game </v>

12
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.554
<v Speaker 1>that's eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First a quick shout out to our channel </v>

13
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:45.314
<v Speaker 1>sponsor wicks and our last video I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about some cool community stuff </v>

14
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>we're doing with their website building </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.043
<v Speaker 1>Now we're happy to unveil our first site</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can vote on what we should </v>

16
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>cover in an upcoming episode of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie podcast.</v>

17
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.213
<v Speaker 1>Show me the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick around until the end to check it </v>

18
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now back to the show.</v>

19
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.693
<v Speaker 1>To Recap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red dead redemption tells the story of </v>

20
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:04.094
<v Speaker 1>John Marsden and Oge cowboy trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a productive member of society </v>

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>until it gets blackmailed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

22
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:12.350
<v Speaker 1>forcing him to hunt down his former gang</v>
<v Speaker 1>members Marston.</v>

23
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Then Moses on down that lonesome trail </v>
<v Speaker 1>into his past seeking redemption.</v>

24
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.683
<v Speaker 1>See what you did though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockstar so he can get back to that </v>

25
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>simple farm life so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic West,</v>

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the game even uses all the classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliches,</v>

27
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>expensive vistas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickdraw,</v>

28
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>shootouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literal cowboying,</v>

29
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.703
<v Speaker 1>gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican and native Americans getting </v>

30
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>shot by a dude called John and horse </v>
<v Speaker 1>riding.</v>

31
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Lots of horse riding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with all this direct Oman,</v>

32
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>where does the satire come in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like GTA?</v>

33
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:42.914
<v Speaker 1>Much of red dead set higher comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game's huge cast of non playable </v>

34
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>characters who at first may seem like </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock Western archetypes.</v>

35
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.623
<v Speaker 1>There's Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good Christian girl in the opening </v>

36
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:52.874
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>

37
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless innocent receives communion,</v>

38
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 2>they're destined to go to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardly seems fair.</v>

39
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.683
<v Speaker 1>Or Sam Odessa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's on a journey to the promised land </v>

40
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>of California or old Billy West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who asked you to collect flowers for his</v>

41
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.014
<v Speaker 1>beloved wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whereas your traditional Western </v>

42
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>would use these tropes to tell wholesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>tales of faith,</v>

43
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>hope or love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red dead redemption has other ideas.</v>

44
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You leave Jenny to die of exposure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the desert.</v>

45
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Sand becomes a paranoid drunk and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find his body torn apart by </v>

46
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>vultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

47
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and billy's loving wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You collected all those flowers for.</v>

48
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>She's actually a rotting corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

49
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.563
<v Speaker 1>You don't look a day over 30 ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You have a character like Louisa and </v>

50
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:33.384
<v Speaker 1>idealist with naive notions of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorious revolution and a free Mexico </v>

51
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>who gets unceremoniously shot dead in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of a mission.</v>

52
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.003
<v Speaker 1>And then the man she claims to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged to can't even remember her name </v>

53
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>was Shay is your peasant girl wife to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

54
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

55
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>She will have a day named after day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said what?</v>

56
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it allowed as well.</v>

57
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>This puts rdr firmly in the camp of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we've talked about before.</v>

58
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>The Post Western,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of anti western that subverts the</v>

59
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>image of the old west as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>classically depicted,</v>

60
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.763
<v Speaker 1>the game pits kind old men and young </v>
<v Speaker 1>maidens against the harsh realities of </v>

61
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:12.844
<v Speaker 1>the lawless west or feeling how easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>these idealists in romantics were </v>

62
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>crushed by the brutality of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>western expansion,</v>

63
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.503
<v Speaker 1>evenly twisted idealism of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical Mexican leader Colonel Again </v>

64
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I fight to help them find themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save them from themselves,</v>

66
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.343
<v Speaker 1>ends rather abruptly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the characters who survive that </v>

67
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:33.154
<v Speaker 1>provides the games most scathing satire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The characters that survive tend to be </v>

68
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>your allies and they will suck except </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonnie.</v>

69
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.943
<v Speaker 1>She's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest are largely selfish and </v>

70
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>unsympathetic.</v>

71
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Leading us to wonder who we're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be rooting for.</v>

72
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Most of them won't even assist you until</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been assisted by you.</v>

73
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Take Marshall Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has some pretty fluid ideas on how to</v>

74
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>police the town of Armadillo in an early</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>

75
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>hopefully call the political realities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Armadillo.</v>

76
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>He reveals a conflict of interests to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it lightly between public safety and</v>

77
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>big business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the railway.</v>

78
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.984
<v Speaker 1>The people are paying my salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get me to turn a blind eye to </v>

79
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned down settlements up there.</v>

80
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.843
<v Speaker 1>You also is more than happy to turn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind eye to crime outside my </v>

81
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is until he owes you a favor.</v>

82
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Then there's Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>West Dickens,</v>

83
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the snake oil salesman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman,</v>

84
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and a harmless old fraud kind of man </v>
<v Speaker 1>that built this country,</v>

85
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.703
<v Speaker 1>a man who actively discourages people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from acting selflessly and uses Marston </v>

86
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:30.694
<v Speaker 1>to when horse racists and sell his tonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>before lending a helping hand or </v>

87
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:34.894
<v Speaker 1>professor McDougall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anthropologist from an Ivy League </v>

88
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.714
<v Speaker 1>school who also happens to be a racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addict whose theories on </v>

89
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>genealogy are constantly proven wrong.</v>

90
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.163
<v Speaker 1>It's remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It completely refute my last book with </v>

91
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>allies like these were forced to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the good guy?</v>

92
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.123
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard the phrase history</v>
<v Speaker 1>is written by the victors and red dead </v>

93
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>redemption seems to agree the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>marshals like Johnson are ultimately the</v>

94
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>ones who tamed the wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Mcdougall,</v>

95
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.164
<v Speaker 1>who believed the native Americans to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>barely human savages survives to bring </v>

96
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.514
<v Speaker 1>these stories back to civilization where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decimation of native tribes </v>

97
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>continued for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild West Dickens,</v>

98
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the entrepreneur and profiteer lives to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell another bottle of Elixir.</v>

99
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>These dick bags were the real champions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wild west.</v>

100
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>The idealist die while the cunning </v>
<v Speaker 1>shysters survive,</v>

101
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.890
<v Speaker 1>such as rockstar satire of the old West </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a post western red dead,</v>

102
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:33.961
<v Speaker 1>not only satirizes the western genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the history of the West itself.</v>

103
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.273
<v Speaker 1>The game takes place at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century when the old lawless </v>

104
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:38.764
<v Speaker 1>west was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed off by industrialization and </v>

105
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>urban development.</v>

106
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.933
<v Speaker 1>Federal law was growing to help police </v>
<v Speaker 1>these newer states and the industrial </v>

107
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>revolution was finally catching up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>western expansion.</v>

108
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.773
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to think that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological progress tamed the Wild </v>

109
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.044
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the game points out that it just </v>

110
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:55.084
<v Speaker 1>brings its own flavor of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a railroad that you can </v>

111
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>take anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as Marshall Johnson points out,</v>

112
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.813
<v Speaker 1>the owners burned down people's houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also given an early machine gun </v>

113
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>twice that you use to gun down entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>rvs.</v>

114
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly your mythic cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootouts,</v>

115
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>but equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more violent,</v>

116
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new technology is awesome.</v>

117
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Socialization is a truly beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

118
00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Mr Marsden,</v>

119
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you end up with a pretty nuanced debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the merits of civilization.</v>

120
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Just as technology came to civilize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

121
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.833
<v Speaker 1>so did the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is similarly not given a </v>

122
00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 1>flattering portrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

123
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Reyes stages a coup against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dope,</v>

124
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.570
<v Speaker 1>botched and cruel colonel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

125
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:37.404
<v Speaker 1>day in Mexico before we meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reyes is described as a heroic </v>

126
00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:42.630
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary leader of great moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

127
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.630
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care for the bourgeois </v>
<v Speaker 3>snobbery or elitism</v>

128
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>when we do meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

129
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a lying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant,</v>

130
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>selfish womanizer who isn't stirring up </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution to free Mexico,</v>

131
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.720
<v Speaker 1>but to get money in power with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>intention of leading once it's attained</v>

132
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.050
<v Speaker 3>like any great leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brother I will delegate.</v>

133
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>The other representative of government </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Edgar Ross.</v>

134
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.133
<v Speaker 1>You know the US official who has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backing of the US government so he can </v>

135
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>civilize the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>he forces you to murder your former </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends by stealing your family.</v>

137
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.573
<v Speaker 4>We need you to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Williamson then had to blackwater as </v>

138
00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:17.454
<v Speaker 4>quick as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we have reason to believe that Dr </v>

139
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.170
<v Speaker 4>van Dolson does in the area or your wife</v>
<v Speaker 4>sends her regards</v>

140
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.223
<v Speaker 1>and when you accomplish your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the entire army to your house to </v>

141
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:30.700
<v Speaker 1>shoot you to pieces even says,</v>

142
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 4>see we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and archer,</v>

143
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 4>we're the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We enforce the rules.</v>

144
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.473
<v Speaker 1>This is a world where the good guys call</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves bad guys and the bad guys </v>

145
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.733
<v Speaker 1>think they're good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the game is targeting the people </v>

146
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:48.900
<v Speaker 1>who built the institutions that survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

147
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't that kind of bleak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Rockstar may not be full of quite as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many edge lords as it seems as their </v>

149
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:59.100
<v Speaker 1>conclusion on the merits of civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite complex.</v>

150
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.203
<v Speaker 1>So sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Marsden and Co argue that while </v>

151
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.070
<v Speaker 1>life is an outlaw is violent and often </v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>

152
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.933
<v Speaker 1>they are at least free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the feds point out that the cowboys </v>

153
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:12.930
<v Speaker 1>violence that comes from defending their</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom kinda sucks for everyone else.</v>

154
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what the alternative is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not complicated.</v>

155
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.150
<v Speaker 4>It's about one man and his gun versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>another man.</v>

156
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization may be dull,</v>

157
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 4>but the alternative Mr Marsden is hell.</v>

158
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>This bleak satire of society can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>summed up in the chief antagonist of the</v>

159
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch band,</v>

160
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.743
<v Speaker 1>Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch is the former leader of Marston's </v>

161
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>old gang and the man you're sent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill,</v>

162
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>but he isn't quite a classic Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>billing.</v>

163
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 1>We hear from Marston how Dutch raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

164
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Leader of the gang taught me how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>read.</v>

165
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.920
<v Speaker 3>He taught me how to see all that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>good in the world.</v>

166
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.840
<v Speaker 3>It was a great man in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

167
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>whenever we meet Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's eloquent and honest.</v>

168
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

169
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:54.254
<v Speaker 1>but isn't everyone in this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the fact that his new </v>

170
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>posse consists almost entirely of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised native Americans who see</v>

171
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:01.404
<v Speaker 1>Dutch as a savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only native American character who </v>

172
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:05.770
<v Speaker 1>talks to Marston and his allies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nastiness,</v>

173
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>is patronized and insulted by Professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdougall and then shot in the head is a</v>

174
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.374
<v Speaker 1>trader by his own people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch is trying to stand against the </v>

175
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>march of the so called civilization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>

176
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
<v Speaker 1>That Marston's mission represents having</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen what it does to people in their </v>

177
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>communities before Dutch dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

178
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>when I'm gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do is find another monster.</v>

179
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.813
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

180
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.830
<v Speaker 1>because they have to justify their wages</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Dutch.</v>

181
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.610
<v Speaker 1>If you want an industrialized military </v>
<v Speaker 1>with machine guns and motorcars,</v>

182
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you need to justify that investment with</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enemy to use it against,</v>

183
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.253
<v Speaker 1>which makes his character of less an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oblique satire and more of an on the </v>

184
00:09:43.991 --> 00:09:44.824
<v Speaker 1>nose commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing as it would only be three years </v>

185
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:47.434
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world war one would break out in </v>

186
00:09:49.391 --> 00:09:50.224
<v Speaker 1>red dead redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only as our nostalgic view of the </v>

187
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:55.810
<v Speaker 1>old west wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so is the idea that the civilization</v>

188
00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:56.644
<v Speaker 1>that replaced it is somehow better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're left with a world in which the </v>

189
00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:02.560
<v Speaker 1>crooked businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish revolutionaries,</v>

190
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.453
<v Speaker 1>morally bankrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academics and corrupt government </v>

191
00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:08.950
<v Speaker 1>officials are the ones laying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>building blocks of the new world.</v>

192
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.873
<v Speaker 1>While the selfless are forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this kind of pessimism running </v>

193
00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:13.714
<v Speaker 1>through the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder a key mantra throughout </v>

194
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>his</v>

195
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 5>erase your past Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marsden</v>

196
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.150
<v Speaker 1>and that</v>

197
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.150
<v Speaker 5>you can erase the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come won't make it go away</v>

198
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.293
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

199
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 5>he's old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

200
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 5>CanNot be nice.</v>

201
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Just as John can't escape his violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

202
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>neither can America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for sticking around.</v>

203
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Guys were very excited to unveil the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first of our mini sites that we designed</v>

204
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:43.650
<v Speaker 1>using wix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're currently doing a full overhaul of</v>

205
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>our main website and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>

206
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>but we wanted to get some new features </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolled out as soon as possible.</v>

207
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the most savvy guy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

208
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Speaker 1>so I was really pleased with how robust </v>
<v Speaker 1>and professional wix site building tools</v>

209
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:56.574
<v Speaker 1>where it's nice when you have an idea in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head on how something should look </v>

210
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.893
<v Speaker 1>and the technology you're using gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the options to make it happen </v>

211
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.463
<v Speaker 1>without the hassle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether you're a seasoned pro or a </v>

212
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:07.614
<v Speaker 1>total newb like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about building or </v>

213
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:10.464
<v Speaker 1>upgrading the website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encourage you to check out what you </v>

214
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>can do with wix and in the meantime,</v>
