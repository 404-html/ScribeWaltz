00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>He only was removed from office or </v>
<v Speaker 1>resigned from office a few months ago,</v>

2
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>a formidable prime minister and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>formidable politician,</v>

3
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and I suspect the Labour Party will </v>
<v Speaker 1>regret removing men,</v>

4
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.280
<v Speaker 2>a very middle class Britain</v>

5
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.033
<v Speaker 1>with a w taken over a very strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and he'd left the same strong </v>

6
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.284
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made some genuinely very brilliant </v>

7
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>reforms and his record will bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching what has saddened,</v>

8
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what blocked that record or harm it is </v>

9
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:50.524
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he was so willing to look </v>

10
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>to some of us just fall in line with </v>
<v Speaker 1>President Bush,</v>

11
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.533
<v Speaker 1>I think Margaret Thatcher would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood up to President Bush and said so </v>

12
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>far and no further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you take away Iraq,</v>

13
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>which you can't from the legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a very impressive premiership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he will be settled historically.</v>

15
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>He will be saddled with Iraq.</v>
