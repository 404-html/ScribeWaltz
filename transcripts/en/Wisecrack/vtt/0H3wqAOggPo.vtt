1
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Play the one case that everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 1>held,</v>

2
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.314
<v Speaker 1>the speculator and people have watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process and operation has been the </v>

3
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.044
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Landis case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cyclist where the two different </v>

4
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:24.561
<v Speaker 1>approaches for detecting testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse suggested that an abuse occurred.</v>

5
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>They two tasks are totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches.</v>

6
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.733
<v Speaker 1>Both came up with the same result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's challenged that and there's one of </v>

7
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.714
<v Speaker 1>the challenges actually the challenge is</v>
<v Speaker 1>work up the chain of command if you </v>

8
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:42.654
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to the United States Anti </v>

9
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Doping Agency and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

10
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the tribunals that looked at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular case of experts,</v>

11
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concluded that there was a doping </v>

12
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:55.164
<v Speaker 1>violation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe he's taking this to the </v>

13
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Court of Arbitration and Sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the last stop.</v>

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a interesting,</v>

15
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for the,</v>

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>because people watched how complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>this all is.</v>

17
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably at the bottom line of </v>

18
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:12.954
<v Speaker 1>what I want to say here is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and sophisticated this all </v>

19
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>this is not just taking a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>the science is very demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>the adjudication process is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding.</v>

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stake here.</v>

25
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only way it seems to me this was</v>

26
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.414
<v Speaker 1>able to be dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still institutionalized the whole </v>

27
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really how water was born,</v>

28
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>whether it was the laboratories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collection of specimens,</v>

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the handing out of sanctions is </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing the list,</v>

30
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>the concept of therapeutic use </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemptions,</v>

31
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>which we should talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>there are so many different elements to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

33
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

34
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundbite critiques of doping really </v>

35
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:08.544
<v Speaker 1>don't do justice to the evolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of doping movement over the last </v>

36
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.094
<v Speaker 1>eight or nine</v>

37
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
