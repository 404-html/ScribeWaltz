1
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.843
<v Speaker 2>track jared here today were dawning our </v>
<v Speaker 2>trench coats as we talk about what went </v>

3
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 2>wrong with the final installment of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather tragic Matrix trilogy,</v>

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could talk about the flat characters,</v>

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 2>unclear motivations and structural </v>
<v Speaker 2>cluster,</v>

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the most important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address is the fact that,</v>

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.833
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie just doesn't make much sense </v>

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>or to put it more generously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has some colossal narrative gaps.</v>

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.033
<v Speaker 2>We basically can't make sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plot without some pretty massive </v>

10
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:37.604
<v Speaker 2>interpretive leads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are our top three burning </v>

11
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>how the hell does neil have powers </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the matrix to?</v>

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Does Neil make his own choices or is he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a pawn of larger forces?</v>

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>And three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is neil supposed to be Jesus again,</v>

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.473
<v Speaker 2>and how does this religious imagery fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the story given how much thought </v>

16
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 2>went into these films?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be that the witch house,</v>

17
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 2>he's just dropped the narrative.</v>

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Ballz oily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

19
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 2>So if the answer is don't lie in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 2>perhaps they lie in the philosophies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that inspired the film's,</v>

21
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 2>woken with his wife's cry condition on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix revolutions,</v>

22
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 2>what went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course spoilers ahead in case you</v>

23
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 2>don't read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch the trilogy every few weeks.</v>

24
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's a recap in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo wakes up from a simulated reality to</v>

25
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:21.554
<v Speaker 2>discover machines control the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is the one prophesized to save </v>

26
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:26.324
<v Speaker 2>humans from their metal photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital ass kicking in suits in </v>

27
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.104
<v Speaker 2>reloaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These dreams are dashed when we </v>

28
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:32.264
<v Speaker 2>discovered that neos not special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prophecy was part of the machine </v>

29
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:36.304
<v Speaker 2>scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the log and the film ends with him </v>

30
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>gaining insane powers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also in a coma.</v>

31
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.583
<v Speaker 2>In revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo awakes from his coma and cooperates </v>

32
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:45.854
<v Speaker 2>with the machines to beat agent Smith </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a fight to the death saving humans </v>

33
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 2>and maybe machines from lives of </v>
<v Speaker 2>servitude.</v>

34
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>So how does neo have power in the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

35
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 2>The only explanation in the film were </v>
<v Speaker 2>given is this.</v>

36
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Tell me how I separated my mind from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body without checking it.</v>

37
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Tell me how I stopped for sentinels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My thinking.</v>

38
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Tell me just what the hell is happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me?</v>

39
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 3>The power extends beyond this world all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way back to where it came from,</v>

40
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 3>where the source,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's great you felt when you touch</v>

41
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 3>those sentence</v>

42
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 2>and then in the end of the Matrix video </v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

43
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.283
<v Speaker 2>we get</v>

44
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 3>touched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The source separated.</v>

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.333
<v Speaker 3>It's mine.</v>

46
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 2>These are basically non explanations </v>
<v Speaker 2>since they don't,</v>

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually explain anything.</v>

48
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.883
<v Speaker 2>There are also fan theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a matrix within a matrix </v>

49
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 2>or maybe Neil's wirelessly connected to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the source.</v>

50
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.193
<v Speaker 2>Dial up is very nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but none of these are really textually </v>

51
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>supported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead we think these mysterious powers</v>

52
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 2>have something to do with French </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers.</v>

53
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 2>John Beaudry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art in the Matrix,</v>

54
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>the witch house keys referenced </v>
<v Speaker 2>boatyards several times.</v>

55
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real,</v>

56
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.203
<v Speaker 2>the desert of the characterizes beaudry </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts critique of the postmodern era </v>

57
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.650
<v Speaker 2>where meaning and reality are replaced </v>
<v Speaker 2>by ear representations for Baudrillard.</v>

58
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.913
<v Speaker 2>The term similar locker described signs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have no relation to the real but </v>

59
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:13.234
<v Speaker 2>pretend to like a painting that looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a polaroid photo of a Unicorn on </v>

60
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When these fake copies without originals</v>

61
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 2>get together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they form simulations,</v>

62
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and when simulations hookup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they replace reality.</v>

63
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.423
<v Speaker 2>With the virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the web of media we're plugged into all </v>

64
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's worse?</v>

65
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 2>There's no easy exit from the virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell it isn't real,</v>

66
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.143
<v Speaker 2>because who even remembers what reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when the virtual becomes more real </v>

67
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 2>than reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We enter hyperreality where technologies</v>

68
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>and simulations control meaning not </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans like a desert wasteland.</v>

69
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Reality is emptied of meaning for </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

70
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the witch house keys took</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a bit,</v>

71
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.014
<v Speaker 2>but literally they show technology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls meaning by literally enslaving </v>

72
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

73
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.263
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real is a literal desert or more </v>

74
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:04.714
<v Speaker 2>like more door meets Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Matrix is not just simulated </v>

75
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 2>ideas and technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a physical network into which humans</v>

76
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>are literally plugged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even bogart himself criticized the witch</v>

77
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.114
<v Speaker 2>house skis saying they took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis of the virtual for an </v>

78
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>irrefutable fact and transformed it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a visible phantasm,</v>

79
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.823
<v Speaker 2>but it is precisely that we can no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer employ categories of the real in </v>

80
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>order to discuss the characteristics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the virtual.</v>

81
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.020
<v Speaker 2>That's French for they've done for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baudrillard.</v>

82
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 2>There are no red pills and blue pills or</v>
<v Speaker 2>external reference points from which you</v>

83
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 2>can distinguish the real from the fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could.</v>

84
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 2>One could easily choose the real as neo </v>
<v Speaker 2>and others do,</v>

85
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>so laying one final bit of smack </v>
<v Speaker 2>boatyard insisted.</v>

86
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.033
<v Speaker 2>What would be interesting is to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when these two worlds </v>

87
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>collide.</v>

88
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 2>It seems the which house keys not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>took boatyards words to heart,</v>

89
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 2>they plotted a pretty wild course </v>
<v Speaker 2>correction in the sequels.</v>

90
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>They attempt to merge the real and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual by giving neo powers.</v>

91
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.853
<v Speaker 2>In the quote real world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we start the trilogy thinking of Neo as </v>

92
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>real and the matrix and its programs as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake,</v>

93
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 2>but as the matrix revolution seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>imply were wrong.</v>

94
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Neo doesn't just plug into the virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't unplug from it.</v>

95
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.363
<v Speaker 2>The virtual is inside of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he kills the sentinels or </v>

96
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:22.174
<v Speaker 2>experiences the train station in a coma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see a more complex idea of the </v>

97
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 2>virtual that is not the opposite of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

98
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.943
<v Speaker 2>but a layer of the real or interwoven </v>
<v Speaker 2>and confused with it that neocon tap </v>

99
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.134
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This may also explain how Smith entered </v>

100
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 2>the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Smith clones himself onto Bain,</v>

101
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 2>the real becomes virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the virtual becomes real,</v>

102
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>and the distinction between mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>body collapses.</v>

103
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.763
<v Speaker 2>This idea of the real world as virtual </v>
<v Speaker 2>can also explain why neo can see the </v>

104
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 2>world as energy pulses as if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual.</v>

105
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the witch house keys borrow from the old</v>

106
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 2>archetype of the blind seer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who through seeing less actually</v>

107
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 2>understands more odin even plucked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own eye to gain knowledge,</v>

108
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 2>although it's probably not what boatyard</v>
<v Speaker 2>had in mind.</v>

109
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.303
<v Speaker 2>Neil's blindness helps him literally see</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental truth about the </v>

110
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the real and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual,</v>

111
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>namely that they aren't as separate as </v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought.</v>

112
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.723
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baudrillard helps explain what's </v>

113
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:21.404
<v Speaker 2>happening in that train station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weird limbo space between the real </v>

114
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.693
<v Speaker 2>and the virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here neo discovers programs who want to </v>

115
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.843
<v Speaker 2>escape the so called real world where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're forced to carry out their </v>

116
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 2>programming and attempt to hide in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix from the perspective of humans,</v>

117
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix as a deceptive false space </v>
<v Speaker 2>that steals their agency,</v>

118
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.993
<v Speaker 2>but for the programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the matrix is a liberatory space where </v>

119
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 2>they can be their true selves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a digital entity,</v>

120
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe the virtual world is the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

121
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.043
<v Speaker 2>This is perhaps why at the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Oracle is ambiguous in her plea to </v>

122
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 2>the architect.</v>

123
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 4>What about the others?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What others come on and say,</v>

124
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm fiercely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will be freed.</v>

125
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Is she referring to the humans or </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines?</v>

126
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.133
<v Speaker 2>Could be both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the machines getting out might </v>

127
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>mean getting in and for the humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice versa.</v>

128
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 2>This brings us to the conflict between </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice and determinism,</v>

129
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 2>which if you remember from our matrix </v>
<v Speaker 2>reloaded video,</v>

130
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 2>they never shut up about</v>

131
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.580
<v Speaker 4>causality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Action,</v>

132
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.300
<v Speaker 4>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause and effect.</v>

133
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 4>Everything begins with choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No wrong.</v>

134
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Inevitable is literally the last word </v>
<v Speaker 2>neo ever speak.</v>

135
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.693
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>

136
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.090
<v Speaker 2>right after he says,</v>

137
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

138
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.903
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose what to keep fighting something </v>

139
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Clear,</v>

140
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:48.584
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever choice he refers to isn't </v>

141
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.523
<v Speaker 2>even up to neo or AC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the product of larger fates and </v>

142
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:55.334
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does this fit in with the oracles </v>

143
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.633
<v Speaker 2>apparent omniscience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it some mutation in his programming </v>

144
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 2>or purpose that drives agent Smith to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start a clone war?</v>

145
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.213
<v Speaker 2>Is it chance or does he reveal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs have the capacity for choice </v>

146
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.174
<v Speaker 2>and free will?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we can use some philosophy </v>

147
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:10.964
<v Speaker 2>of free will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>determinism and fatalism to make sense </v>

148
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:13.964
<v Speaker 2>of this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us experience ourselves as </v>

149
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:16.934
<v Speaker 2>making choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We write geeky videos on Friday nights </v>

150
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:20.234
<v Speaker 2>because like neo week shoes to and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have friends for </v>

151
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.124
<v Speaker 2>aristotle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is because humans are rational </v>

152
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:27.734
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our reason helps us to make choices and </v>

153
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:34.931
<v Speaker 2>differentiates us from other animals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to call something a choice.</v>

154
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.923
<v Speaker 2>One must be able to act otherwise and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be driven by mere instinct or </v>

155
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 2>programming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most of us probably agree with David</v>

156
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.783
<v Speaker 2>Hume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the ability to act or not act </v>

157
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 2>according to our own desires and reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the basis of human freedom.</v>

158
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.053
<v Speaker 2>Neo morpheus and the rest of the gang </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly agree and they're cheesed off </v>

159
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:53.924
<v Speaker 2>because humans are being treated well </v>
<v Speaker 2>like machines with their minds and </v>

160
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 2>bodies totally controlled while plugged </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the matrix.</v>

161
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>They don't seem to have the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>act otherwise,</v>

162
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 2>and of course the arc of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>series bends toward gaining freedom,</v>

163
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.753
<v Speaker 2>but of course it's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo and friends don't realize that </v>

164
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 2>freedom of choice is actually part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the matrix itself.</v>

165
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>In perhaps the most cryptic conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>in cinema history,</v>

166
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.153
<v Speaker 2>the architect reveals earlier versions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Matrix didn't work because even </v>

167
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 2>though the world was perfect for humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were being forced</v>

168
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.920
<v Speaker 4>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Choice,</v>

169
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.893
<v Speaker 2>but choice is so essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans value to it even over perfect </v>

170
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:35.360
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

171
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that the first matrix was </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to be a perfect human,</v>

172
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.073
<v Speaker 1>the world or suffered every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would be happy and it was a </v>

173
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:50.450
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would accept the program.</v>

174
00:09:50.451 --> 00:09:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Entire crops were lost.</v>

175
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.630
<v Speaker 2>The current matrix only works because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts for the human need to choose.</v>

176
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll be at a paradoxical choice to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>up their freedom.</v>

177
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.273
<v Speaker 4>As I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she stumbled upon a solution whereby </v>

178
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.434
<v Speaker 4>nearly 99 percent of all tests subjects </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted the program as long as they </v>

179
00:10:05.141 --> 00:10:05.974
<v Speaker 4>were given a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if they were only aware of the </v>

180
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:09.370
<v Speaker 4>choice at an unconscious level.</v>

181
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

182
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.903
<v Speaker 2>doesn't this look similar to boatyards </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim that we prefer and willingly give </v>

183
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:16.360
<v Speaker 2>up control of meaning to the virtual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

184
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.203
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerrit.</v>

185
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.163
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this produces anomalies in the heart of </v>

186
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:22.490
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo and his five predecessors.</v>

187
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.533
<v Speaker 2>Human choice means there are some </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of the architect's plan that </v>

188
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 2>can't be predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enter Neil,</v>

189
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.360
<v Speaker 2>who chooses to save trinity instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reloading the Matrix,</v>

190
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 2>freewill one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>determinism zero,</v>

191
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.320
<v Speaker 2>but does neo really make a choice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are several reasons to wonder.</v>

192
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.273
<v Speaker 2>First it looks like neo chooses to give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The architects play a big middle finger </v>

193
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:46.820
<v Speaker 2>and runoff the safe trinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for Aristotle and Aquinas,</v>

194
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.130
<v Speaker 2>the passions like love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

195
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.023
<v Speaker 2>jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the Kryptonite of choice and free </v>

196
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:54.890
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're no more than animal impulses.</v>

197
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.700
<v Speaker 2>The architect also isn't buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because he doesn't understand</v>

198
00:10:58.701 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

199
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 1>You and I may not be able to see beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own choices,</v>

200
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>but that man can't see past any choice</v>

201
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.930
<v Speaker 2>or it's because he thinks neos returned </v>
<v Speaker 2>to trinity is just the result of another</v>

202
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:10.730
<v Speaker 2>causal law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love</v>

203
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.723
<v Speaker 4>already I can see the chain reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chemical precursors that signal the </v>

204
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 4>onset of an emotion signed specifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>to overwhelm logic and reason</v>

205
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 2>or as a wise crack favorite puts it what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people call love.</v>

206
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just a chemical reaction to compels</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals to breed.</v>

207
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.930
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that neos just responding </v>
<v Speaker 2>to basic evolutionary programming,</v>

208
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>what the architect refers to as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical reaction.</v>

209
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Colonel Sanders incarnate believed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is mechanistic.</v>

210
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.303
<v Speaker 2>The matrix fellow programs and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans don't have choice but operate </v>

211
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:41.444
<v Speaker 2>unphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical and mathematical laws of </v>

212
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:44.534
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This version of determinism dates back </v>

213
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:47.264
<v Speaker 2>to ancient philosophers like Democritus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loose ipis and others you might confuse </v>

214
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>for diseases who began noting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical was not random,</v>

215
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but governed by strict causal laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Determinist buzz kills that.</v>

216
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 2>They are always claimed the appearance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of choice is just part of the system.</v>

217
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.323
<v Speaker 2>Once the architect notices the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to at least feel like they're </v>

218
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 2>making choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they'd be plugged in like so</v>

219
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 2>many light brights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>

220
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 2>he just adds choice to his determinist </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations.</v>

221
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.333
<v Speaker 2>Then the whole function of the one is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control the narrative of choice and </v>

222
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 2>resistance in a way that suits the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

223
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck in a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you think you're escaping the</v>

224
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

225
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Xy on rises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one appears.</v>

226
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 2>He meets the architect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one chooses most.</v>

227
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:31.774
<v Speaker 2>Everyone dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix reloads xy on the one weird </v>

228
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice death,</v>

229
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 2>reload,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rinse and repeat until neo,</v>

230
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 2>but even if we buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's love with a capital l,</v>

231
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.313
<v Speaker 2>not just chemicals that made him exit </v>
<v Speaker 2>door number two or do whatever he's </v>

232
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 2>referring to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are still reasons to be suspicious</v>

233
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:53.554
<v Speaker 2>that it was ancient human choice for </v>
<v Speaker 2>medieval theologian and 40 year old </v>

234
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Virgin Thomas Aquinas choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Enough.</v>

235
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.213
<v Speaker 2>It's our freewill that makes us </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to which goals are best or </v>

236
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 2>most moral and allows us to be held </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for our choices is neos will</v>

237
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

238
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one very powerful old lady and something</v>

239
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.424
<v Speaker 2>called fatalism makes that unlikely and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about fatalism is like </v>

240
00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 2>determinism with a heaping spoonful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the supernatural.</v>

241
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.303
<v Speaker 2>Let's focused on physical laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatalist claim events are destined to </v>

242
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>occur because the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fate,</v>

243
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.360
<v Speaker 2>or even our own character and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion's directly caused them to and</v>

244
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 2>if by gods they mean a bearded math </v>
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>

245
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 2>a cookie baking profit and a self </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicating Lord l Ron,</v>

246
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 2>then we're inclined to agree over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of the films,</v>

247
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 2>the Oracle's been very busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the one behind the prophecy and if</v>

248
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>we're to believe the prophecy is just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanization to met out the anomaly and</v>

249
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:56.674
<v Speaker 2>guide him to the source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that would mean she's tricking neo </v>

250
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 2>and his pals into almost every one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their decisions.</v>

251
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Even when she pretends it's his choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a fatalist lens.</v>

252
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:07.984
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like she and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>architect are pulling all the strings </v>

253
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.793
<v Speaker 2>and the whole series is just a game of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chess between the two of them made a </v>

254
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then again,</v>

255
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:17.794
<v Speaker 2>the witch house keys leave us wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the Oracle really make her own </v>

256
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:21.094
<v Speaker 2>choices or is she just a product of fate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and determinism to by aristotle and </v>

257
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Aquinas is definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems she does make choices.</v>

258
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.703
<v Speaker 2>I made a choice and that choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she makes the choice to save Sati and </v>

259
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 2>let agent Smith turned her into a clown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she also says she made these choices</v>

260
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:44.611
<v Speaker 2>to fulfill her purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your purpose to balance?</v>

261
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.750
<v Speaker 2>She also says they had to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

262
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it couldn't be here like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember</v>

263
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't meant to be</v>

264
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.823
<v Speaker 2>so maybe she isn't making choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if neo isn't making his own choices </v>

265
00:14:58.861 --> 00:15:01.260
<v Speaker 2>and the oracle might not be either than </v>
<v Speaker 2>is anyone.</v>

266
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 2>This movie is freaking impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe agent Smith,</v>

267
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.384
<v Speaker 2>as his name suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the only real being with agency in </v>

268
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 2>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he's killed by neo,</v>

269
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 2>he refuses to return to the source to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>

270
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I knew the route,</v>

271
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.470
<v Speaker 5>so I understood what I was supposed.</v>

272
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a choice similar to the one neo </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes,</v>

273
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

274
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.903
<v Speaker 2>by his own account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smith as a diehard fatalist and he </v>

275
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Speaker 2>doesn't see this as a matter of will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of a grander plan.</v>

276
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 5>We're not here because we're here </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're not free.</v>

277
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.920
<v Speaker 5>There's no skipping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no denying purpose,</v>

278
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.750
<v Speaker 5>because as we both know without purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would not exist</v>

279
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.250
<v Speaker 2>and he's pretty sure his purpose is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still to kill neo.</v>

280
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agent Smith believes freedom.</v>

281
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.483
<v Speaker 2>Truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace and love are just illusions and </v>

282
00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:55.830
<v Speaker 2>fantasies as meaningless as the matrix </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

283
00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 6>There's a freedom or peace but love </v>
<v Speaker 6>illusions.</v>

284
00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 6>Mr Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vagaries of perception,</v>

285
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.450
<v Speaker 6>temporary constructs of a feeble human </v>
<v Speaker 6>intellect,</v>

286
00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:08.284
<v Speaker 6>trying just Berkeley to justify an </v>
<v Speaker 6>existence that is without meaning or </v>

287
00:16:11.441 --> 00:16:15.220
<v Speaker 6>purpose in all of them as artificial as </v>
<v Speaker 6>the matrix.</v>

288
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Really programming and fate are real and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not programmed,</v>

289
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:20.893
<v Speaker 2>human lives are empty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just when determinism and fate </v>

290
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 2>appear to have kicked us out of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're reminded that will for freedom.</v>

291
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Peace and love means something for both </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans and programs.</v>

292
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.573
<v Speaker 3>I love my doctor very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have never program speak of see </v>

293
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.090
<v Speaker 3>human emotion now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

294
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.240
<v Speaker 3>But methods is the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The word implies</v>

295
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.163
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not just an illusion or some </v>

296
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.694
<v Speaker 2>chemical Bs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a powerful and meaningful </v>

297
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:52.544
<v Speaker 2>connection and so his freedom or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to do otherwise sati doesn't </v>

298
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 2>have a purpose.</v>

299
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I find it to be the most beautiful thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen,</v>

300
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.320
<v Speaker 3>like where we are from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not enough.</v>

301
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Every program that is created must have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a purpose.</v>

302
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 3>If it does not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is deleted,</v>

303
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 2>but her life is still worth living and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she should be free to live it.</v>

304
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Neo realizes that just as humans can </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise their freewill,</v>

305
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.563
<v Speaker 2>some programs can't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe This is what makes neo realize </v>

306
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 2>that it isn't just humanity that needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>saving from this war.</v>

307
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 2>If we really want to talk about choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there must be choice for everyone.</v>

308
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we can put our neck braces away,</v>

309
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:30.524
<v Speaker 2>we're in for more whiplash because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the oracle who sent sati and her family </v>

310
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 2>here at this exact time for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation about freedom,</v>

311
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.640
<v Speaker 3>what choice to help you to guy neil</v>

312
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.730
<v Speaker 2>high and it makes it again seem like </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's controlling everything.</v>

313
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.150
<v Speaker 2>After all thIs and all the films chit </v>
<v Speaker 2>chat about choice.</v>

314
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not that neo or anyone else for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter actually makes one.</v>

315
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 2>If nobody is making choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is neil,</v>

316
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 2>even the real protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the oracle?</v>

317
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Are we even supposed to care as if there</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't enough unexplained plot points?</v>

318
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Revolutions ends with some confusing </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious imagery.</v>

319
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 2>What exactly is this glowing jacked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus supposed to show us?</v>

320
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can explain this in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice versus fate,</v>

321
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.423
<v Speaker 2>but also faith from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo is a quasi religious figure who </v>

322
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 2>helps save humans from their ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and enslavement in the matrix.</v>

323
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.073
<v Speaker 2>He's basically straight out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gnostic gospels which talk about a </v>

324
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 2>savior who is the ultimate guide to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of reality.</v>

325
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.153
<v Speaker 2>This group of religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly christian heretics in the early </v>

326
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 2>ce claimed that humans perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 2>material world in darkness,</v>

327
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 2>sleep night and blindness and must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>saved through waking knowledge,</v>

328
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

329
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.293
<v Speaker 2>Sound familiar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil basically spends half the trilogy </v>

330
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 2>just waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When neo sacrIfices himself,</v>

331
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 2>he enables true knowledge of reality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace between machines and humans,</v>

332
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's not determinism that gets him </v>
<v Speaker 2>this far.</v>

333
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.103
<v Speaker 2>It's faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has faith in his purpose and in the </v>

334
00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 2>possibility of peace even when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a clue what he's doing,</v>

335
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.420
<v Speaker 5>but beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know</v>

336
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.543
<v Speaker 2>even the faith of the other characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>play a big role in turning the tide of </v>

337
00:19:12.641 --> 00:19:13.474
<v Speaker 2>the war.</v>

338
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

339
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.950
<v Speaker 2>while we can't explain how neo raises </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dead or how the blind can see,</v>

340
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that kind of seems like part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

341
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the religious imagery is the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>word on the whole determinism business.</v>

342
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Some things exist beyond reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clarity or calculations,</v>

343
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe part of what makes us human is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this capacity for faith in peace,</v>

344
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.620
<v Speaker 2>in goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and something beyond ourselves.</v>

345
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.633
<v Speaker 2>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've tried to fill some plot holes by </v>

346
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 2>exploring the witch house keys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

347
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:45.474
<v Speaker 2>faves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the answer to our question </v>

348
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:50.190
<v Speaker 2>has been lying in a small detail all </v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

349
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.203
<v Speaker 2>The oracles earrings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe many of the inexplicably </v>

350
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:54.384
<v Speaker 2>happenings in revolutions are there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prove some sort of uni and yankee point </v>

351
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.420
<v Speaker 2>that it's not about winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but balance.</v>

352
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.463
<v Speaker 2>the philosophy of yin and yang found in </v>
<v Speaker 2>taoism and confucianism is present in </v>

353
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 2>the films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only in jewelry,</v>

354
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 2>but in themes like balance cycles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dichotomies.</v>

355
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.393
<v Speaker 2>According to chinese philosopher joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he yin represents a dark condensing </v>

356
00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 2>force and is associated with metal fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the material world.</v>

357
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Yang is associated with light expanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces,</v>

358
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

359
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.203
<v Speaker 2>ci or energy forces in life flows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Notice that in revolutions the real </v>

360
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:28.764
<v Speaker 2>world is full of machines and bodies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>is literally dark and on fire while the </v>

361
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 2>virtual world is of the mind or things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are light and well not on fire,</v>

362
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>but getting yang are not dichotomies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stand for opposite,</v>

363
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 2>but connected forces like a light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark side of the same hill.</v>

364
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.583
<v Speaker 2>So why do asian smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo both have unexplained powers and </v>

365
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 2>obsess over each other because they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>yin and yang,</v>

366
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 2>light and dark sides of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>anomaly.</v>

367
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.840
<v Speaker 3>what is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

368
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.083
<v Speaker 3>You could be so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The equation trying to balance itself </v>

369
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.060
<v Speaker 3>out</v>

370
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.210
<v Speaker 2>instead of confusing the real and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual allah baudrillard,</v>

371
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.133
<v Speaker 2>yin and yang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help explain how the real and the </v>

372
00:21:10.401 --> 00:21:11.234
<v Speaker 2>virtual are two sides of the same coin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and both are important for achieving </v>

373
00:21:14.661 --> 00:21:19.070
<v Speaker 2>peace between machines and humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was neo making his own choices or was he</v>

374
00:21:19.071 --> 00:21:19.904
<v Speaker 2>determined by larger fates like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>architect and the oracle who are also a </v>

375
00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:25.250
<v Speaker 2>bit uni and yaggie we'll never really </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

376
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but in revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice and fate are a bit yin and yang.</v>

377
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Equally important aspects of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

378
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.563
<v Speaker 2>Is the matrix really a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegory bringing credence to the </v>

379
00:21:35.001 --> 00:21:35.834
<v Speaker 2>prophecy or did the oracle make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing up to win a game of wits </v>

380
00:21:38.871 --> 00:21:40.550
<v Speaker 2>against the architect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

381
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.490
<v Speaker 2>we'll never know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that's deliberate.</v>

382
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.503
<v Speaker 2>Both faith and faith are important </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of making meaning for programs </v>

383
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:50.840
<v Speaker 2>and humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe we're being too meta here,</v>

384
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.763
<v Speaker 2>but it seems revolutions even combines </v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern and western philosophy as two </v>

385
00:21:55.341 --> 00:21:57.770
<v Speaker 2>important parts of the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

386
00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.380
<v Speaker 2>So to summarIze what went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

387
00:22:00.381 --> 00:22:01.214
<v Speaker 2>we've spent over 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophizing about these films and </v>

388
00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:06.410
<v Speaker 2>still have no idea what exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

389
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film seems committed to being beyond</v>

390
00:22:10.671 --> 00:22:15.140
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they told us everything or flawlessly</v>

391
00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:18.440
<v Speaker 2>implemented each philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't they just undermine their whole</v>

392
00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:22.760
<v Speaker 2>point at some things are beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning calculation and that's okay.</v>

393
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe we're giving the which house </v>
<v Speaker 2>keys.</v>

394
00:22:24.621 --> 00:22:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Too much credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way,</v>

395
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.103
<v Speaker 2>despite their flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't be unplugging from these </v>

396
00:22:28.851 --> 00:22:30.260
