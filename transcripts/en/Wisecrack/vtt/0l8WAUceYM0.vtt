00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it,</v>

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just be off for six months and</v>

3
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:09.034
<v Speaker 1>then step on a stage and expect to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of incomplete possession of your </v>

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.193
<v Speaker 1>vocal powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a muscle like anything else and </v>

5
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:18.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice and you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what keeps you,</v>

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I think going strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a terrible story.</v>

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a terrible story,</v>

9
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.444
<v Speaker 1>but a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dreadful when you think about it </v>

10
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was back in the early nineties,</v>

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.163
<v Speaker 1>I was touring in Australia with Lucinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>Williams and Rosanne cash and we were </v>

12
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:49.101
<v Speaker 1>doing these songwriter nights all around</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and uh,</v>

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>every night we and we often share the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same big dressing room or whatever.</v>

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>And every night Roseanne and Lucinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>would warm up vocally.</v>

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.233
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't quite gotten to that place </v>

16
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>where I realized that how important that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Roseanne would be in her corner,</v>

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>a singing scales and doing that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

19
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And Lucinda had some method in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner,</v>

20
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.504
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she would sort of almost bend </v>

21
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:21.591
<v Speaker 1>over and try to breathe up and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would sort of wonder what I would</v>

22
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>do and I'd sit in my corner smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

23
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't smoke anymore.</v>

24
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I quit that a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

25
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.243
<v Speaker 1>that's how naive I was about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>important it is to take care of your </v>

26
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.003
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.313
<v Speaker 1>I know that a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of artists who smoke say </v>

28
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>that and swear by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>

30
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:48.304
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

31
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I had to quit a long time ago.</v>
