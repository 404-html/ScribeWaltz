86
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>like all fresh jams laid down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my girl Jane Austin,</v>

87
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>this tax got an ass load to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and society back in the day.</v>

88
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Emma's a choice example of what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>empowered woman or the time looks like.</v>

89
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Whereas most gals had to rely on men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair thing.</v>

90
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.273
<v Speaker 1>Emma don't need nothing from nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got the money and the power to </v>

91
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>control her own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in the crib and in the hood.</v>

92
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Sound's all good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Set that control ain't all it's cracked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to be.</v>

94
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.293
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just turns her into a miserable </v>

95
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:49.654
<v Speaker 1>haven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real evils indeed of Emma situation </v>

96
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.104
<v Speaker 1>where the power of having rather too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much her own way and the disposition to </v>

97
00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:57.554
<v Speaker 1>think a little too allover itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were the disadvantages which </v>

98
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 1>threatened to Lloyd's or her many </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyments.</v>

99
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.483
<v Speaker 1>The danger however was that presence so </v>
<v Speaker 1>on proceed that they did not by any </v>

100
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>means grandkids misfortunes with her.</v>

101
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Funny thing is Miley always telling him </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that is,</v>

102
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:15.434
<v Speaker 1>the duty of fat cats to look out for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pope folk since they the leaders of the </v>

103
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>hood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like my girl Jane Austin,</v>

104
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:22.304
<v Speaker 1>do she just slang an irony up in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause money show is held on make people </v>

105
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:26.804
<v Speaker 1>act right towards anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now check I that fuck boy out and sugar </v>

106
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.004
<v Speaker 1>mama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just came up in the game and got </v>

107
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:33.614
<v Speaker 1>paid but still be acting like a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always acting nasty and saying stupid </v>

108
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:38.864
<v Speaker 1>shit in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That new money show didn't give her no </v>

109
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even without slow pockets,</v>

110
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>people still acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elton thank he can get with Emma,</v>

111
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.493
<v Speaker 1>but say Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too much of a hood rat and </v>

112
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's good for him or the slum it with</v>

113
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you too.</v>

114
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Good for Harriet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that player.</v>

115
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Truth is Austin Hayden or anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with rank or status,</v>

116
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.203
<v Speaker 1>no matter what your money looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she throw the most Ceda Emma who </v>

117
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:06.454
<v Speaker 1>spent her time thinking that people got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay in that place and anybody who </v>

118
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:12.010
<v Speaker 1>tried to better themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just clowning.</v>

119
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Just check out what she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Elton tried to put a ring on it,</v>

120
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>he must know that unfortunate </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

121
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.034
<v Speaker 1>She was greatly his superior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must know that the one houses had </v>

122
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 1>been sat up for several generations at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hartfield.</v>

123
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.483
<v Speaker 1>The younger brands have a very ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and that the alums were nobody </v>

124
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>for Emma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a hater.</v>

125
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>How can they read a tolerate her stank </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass?</v>

126
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when my girl Jane austen's pro </v>

127
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:36.644
<v Speaker 1>writing skills come into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She slanging this technique called free </v>

128
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>indirect discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

129
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>the narration is highly close to Emma's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

130
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>but it also includes some outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary,</v>

131
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.973
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a step back from her wack ass </v>

132
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>perspective so the audience can follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>her motivations but not how to deal with</v>

133
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 1>the shallow bulls.</v>

134
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I put her down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel me?</v>

135
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Thank goodness though Austin don't use </v>
<v Speaker 1>free and direct discourse.</v>

136
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>What the more righteous characters like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss Westin and nightly since miss w and</v>

137
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:07.934
<v Speaker 1>k money too legit to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin just let their words speak for </v>

138
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
