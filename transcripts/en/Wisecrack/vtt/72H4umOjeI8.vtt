<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi mark.</v>

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Hi Mark.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Greetings and welcome to earthling </v>
<v Speaker 2>cinema.</v>

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm your host Garrick's worm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Lloyd.</v>

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 2>This week's artifact is the room </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

6
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 2>directed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and starring.</v>

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 2>My time traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's son,</v>

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Wiser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film follows human banker Johnny,</v>

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 2>who despite everything about him is </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken seriously by his friends.</v>

10
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.703
<v Speaker 2>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have you as my best friend and I love </v>

11
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Lisa so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives with the apple of his eyeball,</v>

12
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.724
<v Speaker 2>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are madly in love for two </v>

13
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 2>scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired of Johnny's esophagus disorder.</v>

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Lisa cheats on him with his bff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forelle mark,</v>

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>last name unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

16
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Lisa so done with Johnny's smoking hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>bod.</v>

17
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 2>She gets him drunk to frame him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic abuse.</v>

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Johnny naturally denies this to no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular.</v>

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Not hit her.</v>

20
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Did Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hi mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And makes his home phone where?</v>

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Wire at an evacuation from the womb </v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

23
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Mark and Lisa are caught swapping DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>orally.</v>

24
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To save the relationship,</v>

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Johnny announces that Lisa is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant than a dramatic pause.</v>

26
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 2>We're expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lisa,</v>

27
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denies this.</v>

28
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.473
<v Speaker 2>There is no baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Imitates a horse and market tax </v>

<v Speaker 2>heartbroken.</v>

30
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Johnny locks himself in an indoor Porta </v>
<v Speaker 2>potty,</v>

31
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 2>the phone rats on Lisa and they agree to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bitter breakup.</v>

32
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Get Out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out,</v>

33
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.940

<v Speaker 2>earth females.</v>

34

<v Speaker 2>Johnny sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A glock.</v>

35
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 2>The room is a tale of duplicity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>follies of love and trust to things I </v>

36
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:52.614
<v Speaker 2>know little about the film takes many </v>
<v Speaker 2>cues from classic dramas such as rebel </v>

<v Speaker 2>Wilson Without a cause and the streetcar</v>
<v Speaker 2>named desire.</v>

38
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:02.784
<v Speaker 2>Part one,</v>

39
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the latter of which provided sematic </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration for the room,</v>

40
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.343
<v Speaker 2>which was oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledges with a little wink in the </v>

<v Speaker 2>just like blanche.</v>

44
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.840
<v Speaker 2>The characters in the room live </v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicitous often under the influence of</v>

45
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:29.441
<v Speaker 2>c,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Lisa pretends to be a devoted lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in reality is only using johnny for </v>

49
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:38.674
<v Speaker 2>his sweet bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark pretends to be a loyal friend when </v>

50
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.334
<v Speaker 2>he's actually in bed with Lisa fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting the soullessness that comes </v>

51
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.104
<v Speaker 2>with living a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost all the characters deliver their </v>

52
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 2>performances in a robotic fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

53
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:52.834
<v Speaker 2>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you doing?</v>

54
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very busy.</v>

55
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:54.694
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to say with a battery of their </v>

56
00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:57.490
<v Speaker 2>butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

57
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 2>The computer business is too </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>

58
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.083
<v Speaker 2>The film accentuates this effect by </v>
<v Speaker 2>juxtaposing these lifeless characters </v>

59
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>with the visceral energy of Chris r </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>

60
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.713
<v Speaker 2>although he's a criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the only character who is honest </v>

61
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.624
<v Speaker 2>about who he is and therefore he's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only one who appears high on life and </v>

62
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.304
<v Speaker 2>crack what is just as in streetcar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room centers around a domestic </v>

63
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>location,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnnie's apartment.</v>

64
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 2>The titular Tommy [inaudible] the room </v>
<v Speaker 2>by concentrating the action on the home.</v>

65
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 2>The film focuses on the relationships </v>
<v Speaker 2>that form the sort of conflict.</v>

66
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 2>The room takes a skeptical view of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal,</v>

67
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.683
<v Speaker 2>intra human connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny appears to have a ton of friends </v>

68
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 2>on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in actuality they're just liking his</v>

69
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:45.061
<v Speaker 2>status is out of boredom anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not worth it.</v>

70
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.743
<v Speaker 2>The visual Motif of a foot sphere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>capsulates the film's pessimistic view </v>

71
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>of friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although intended for comradery,</v>

72
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>it causes injury to two characters on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mat come up.</v>

73
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.763
<v Speaker 2>The message is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friendship can hurt and mostly happens </v>

74
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 2>in alleyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Similarly,</v>

75
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>early in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the color red symbolizes love and sex in</v>

76
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 2>the city and everything from Lisa's red </v>
<v Speaker 2>dress to these red candles,</v>

77
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>to the roses in the bedroom to this ball</v>
<v Speaker 2>gag at the end of the film.</v>

78
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Johnny rips up,</v>

79
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 2>the red dress shoots himself and dies in</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ocean of blood,</v>

80
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 2>also known as hitting the Johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The colors,</v>

81
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:23.224
<v Speaker 2>meaning is transformed to reflect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventual outcome of some relationships </v>

82
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>and all of humanity in its emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>climax and sexual climax.</v>

83
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 2>The film breaks the fourth wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When denny uses wise,</v>

84
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.423
<v Speaker 2>those real first name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>johnny plays brilliantly turning the </v>

85
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:40.924
<v Speaker 2>camera on the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film forces us to question whether </v>

86
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>we are deluding ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this film won an Oscar,</v>

87
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't it?</v>

88
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed.</v>

89
00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:53.924
