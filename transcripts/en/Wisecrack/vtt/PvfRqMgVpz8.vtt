1
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.843
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack jared incarnate again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got another wise crack quick </v>

2
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>take on this week's rick and morty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episode Pickle Rick.</v>

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm pickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to answer the question,</v>

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>why does rick turned into a pickle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

5
00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because Dan Harmon said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick is a pickle in a writer's room,</v>

6
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>brainstorm harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just goes,</v>

7
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:21.724
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the other easy answer </v>

8
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>to avoid family therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you stick with me,</v>

9
00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to argue that rick's being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle can teach us a lot about freedom,</v>

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>woken loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.703
<v Speaker 1>crack quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on pickle rick and of course </v>

12
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first a recap.</v>

13
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you couldn't produce,</v>

14
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>has turned himself into a pickle to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of family therapy,</v>

15
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.483
<v Speaker 1>but things go awry and he ends up </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting his way out of a sewer and </v>

16
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>later a Russian embassy using a Mech </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit made out of Roche parts and rap.</v>

17
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:50.104
<v Speaker 1>Lynn's meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth summer and morty have to go to </v>

18
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:52.804
<v Speaker 1>family therapy after summer huffed </v>
<v Speaker 1>pottery and animal and morty peed his </v>

19
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:56.524
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a clever parallel between Beth </v>

20
00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:58.954
<v Speaker 1>and rick in this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as Rick goes to insane lengths to </v>

21
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:02.764
<v Speaker 1>avoid bearing his emotions and therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth is doing her best to stonewall her </v>

22
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointed therapist,</v>

23
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>and maintain her emotional distance.</v>

24
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible that you and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>father have a very specific dynamic.</v>

25
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's one that rewards </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion or vulnerability.</v>

26
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.244
<v Speaker 2>I think it may punish them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible that dynamic you </v>

27
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 2>voted your marriage and as infecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids with the tendency to Mr.</v>

28
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Hack their feelings,</v>

29
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.853
<v Speaker 1>both of you to one thing we've noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the season is that there's more </v>

30
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on serialized arcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last episode,</v>

31
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Rick is willing to stay in Mad Max land </v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid dealing with his daughters </v>

32
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.114
<v Speaker 1>divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad has gone through a divorce and I </v>

33
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>am not dealing with it in a healthy way </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

34
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Now he's literally turned himself into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle to run away from reality,</v>

35
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and Mourdian summers seem increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged by their parents' divorce.</v>

36
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.623
<v Speaker 2>I am mad that I can't have enamel </v>
<v Speaker 2>without people assuming it's because my </v>

37
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 2>family is sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With</v>

38
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.133
<v Speaker 1>continuation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've noticed a few themes that seem to </v>

39
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>be slowly developing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of which is freedom.</v>

40
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>This quote from Dr Wong really sets the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage for our discussion.</v>

41
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.783
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because the only truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unapproachable concept for you is that </v>

42
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 2>it's your mind within your control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You chose to come here.</v>

43
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 2>You chose to talk to belittle my </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocation.</v>

44
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Just as you chose to become a pickle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of us gets to choose.</v>

45
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.783
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Wong's monologue seemed a little </v>

46
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:27.760
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

47
00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>how could rick not understand that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in control?</v>

48
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>He can do anything including turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself into a pickle.</v>

49
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>The reason anyone would do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they could,</v>

50
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>which they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be because they could,</v>

51
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.033
<v Speaker 1>which they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after digging through my notes on </v>

52
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:41.704
<v Speaker 1>the ugliest of existential philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Dr Wong's monologue gets us to </v>

53
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>something quite insightful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we all know,</v>

54
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Rick doesn't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no god.</v>

55
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to rip that bandaid off.</v>

56
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:52.294
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll thank me later and for </v>

57
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Paul Sarte.</v>

58
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Godlessness means we are radically free </v>
<v Speaker 1>to define our own existence,</v>

59
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.313
<v Speaker 1>but we choose to do things based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>social pressures or who we think we're </v>

60
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of other bolts start calls</v>

61
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>this acting in bad faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since we're mortal,</v>

62
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a fixed amount of choices to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make in our lives.</v>

63
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>What sarc calls finitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and each of those choices prevents other</v>

64
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:16.444
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choosing to be a truck driver means </v>

65
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:18.634
<v Speaker 1>choosing not to be a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To deny the importance of our finite </v>

66
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>choices is another way to act in bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>

67
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Often we pretend to not have a choice as</v>
<v Speaker 1>west side story puts it.</v>

68
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.561
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nick.</v>

69
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:29.394
<v Speaker 2>Sergeant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crop,</v>

70
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.393
<v Speaker 2>yet gotta understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just odd bringing upkeep that gets </v>

71
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>us out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our mothers are junkies are fathers,</v>

72
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:38.840
<v Speaker 2>all are drunks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golly.</v>

73
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Most naturally your punks,</v>

74
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.440
<v Speaker 1>essentially the hopelessness know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting like a bunch of little,</v>

75
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but instead of choosing to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they relinquished their choice and blame</v>

76
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>it on their negligent parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm so bad.</v>

77
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.753
<v Speaker 1>They just can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's unique about rick is that he </v>

78
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.090
<v Speaker 1>doesn't deal with finitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He deals with infinitude.</v>

79
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>My access to infinite timelines </v>
<v Speaker 1>precludes the necessity of attachment.</v>

80
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Rick has to grapple with the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what SARC proposed because </v>

81
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:07.470
<v Speaker 1>to call back to season one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of realities.</v>

82
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:08.304
<v Speaker 1>Morty rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>SARC criticizes the person who won't </v>

83
00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:11.034
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for their choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick thinks he doesn't have to because </v>

84
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>he's already made them and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite versions of himself.</v>

85
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>If Stuart said the human condition was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

86
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:21.060
<v Speaker 1>a finite choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.030
<v Speaker 1>rick has transcended that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition with science,</v>

88
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.983
<v Speaker 1>but as Dr Wong suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justifying your actions with the </v>

89
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:28.284
<v Speaker 1>multiverse or your godlike intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a solution because although </v>

90
00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 1>intelligence can help you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

91
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you still have to make the decision.</v>

92
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.043
<v Speaker 2>The only connection between your </v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestionable intelligence and the </v>

93
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>sickness destroying your family is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in your family,</v>

94
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 2>you included use intelligence to justify</v>
<v Speaker 2>sickness.</v>

95
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that rick is the master</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his universe,</v>

96
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>he paradoxically has yet to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms with his own choices.</v>

97
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 1>No matter how many versions of Rick </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

98
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.550
<v Speaker 1>nothing can stop the fact that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices are uniquely his own.</v>

99
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Because to quote Dr Wong,</v>

100
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.913
<v Speaker 2>the only truly unapproachable concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you is that it's your mind within </v>

101
00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 2>your control.</v>

102
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.393
<v Speaker 1>In season one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick Straight up tells us how he deals </v>

103
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>with the infinite choice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiverse.</v>

104
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>What about the reality where Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 1>cured cancer?</v>

105
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is don't think about it,</v>

106
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>but of course all therapy does this make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about things?</v>

107
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.753
<v Speaker 1>So rick turns himself into a pickle to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid choice or at least the appearance </v>

108
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:23.434
<v Speaker 1>of it as a helpless armless pickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not his fault if he can't make </v>

109
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:27.274
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that sense Rick's blatant </v>

110
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>disregard for his choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as SARC would say,</v>

111
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>is acting in bad faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of arcs,</v>

112
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:34.954
<v Speaker 1>this ties nicely into what we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in the last episode between </v>

113
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.404
<v Speaker 1>Jerry's powerlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortise resentment of him for that very </v>

114
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.494
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the juxtaposition with Rick as an </v>

115
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.014
<v Speaker 1>all powerful madman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't respect therapy because I'm </v>

116
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.390
<v Speaker 1>a scientist because I invent </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed,</v>

117
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy for a living.</v>

118
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And when I don't like something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

119
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd change it.</v>

120
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.983
<v Speaker 1>This season is really leading into ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>of agency and I'm super excited to see </v>

121
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>what they come up with next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one last thing worth noting,</v>

122
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably more of a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the common characterization of Freud's </v>
<v Speaker 1>work as everything is a penis.</v>

124
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced someone in their writer's </v>

125
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.874
<v Speaker 1>room probably took this loose connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>between a phallic object in therapy and </v>

126
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.983
<v Speaker 1>who went to little wild with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you want to hear more about </v>

127
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.414
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
