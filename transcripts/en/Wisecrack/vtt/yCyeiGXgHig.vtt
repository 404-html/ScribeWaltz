<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by legal zoom </v>
<v Speaker 1>more on legal zoom at the end of the </v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know about you,</v>

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>but every time a new Christopher Nolan </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie comes out,</v>

5
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:10.224
<v Speaker 1>I happily shell out my harder and 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks for a sweet imax 70 millimeter </v>

6
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.384
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are few directors today that can </v>

7
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>meld thought provoking philosophy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>big budgets,</v>

8
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>spectacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nolan well,</v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>he makes it look as easy as spinning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of focusing on one particular </v>

11
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Nolan film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a step back and look</v>

12
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>at his entire filmography because </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout all 10 of Nolan's movies,</v>

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>certain themes keep coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

14
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.084
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've pulled the ultimate Hollywood </v>

15
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.414
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's Christopher Nolan video will be </v>

16
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the first of three on the director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

17
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not pulling a hobbit and extending</v>

18
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>a children's book into a seven hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>trilogy.</v>

19
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Think of this instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

20
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:50.544
<v Speaker 1>as our Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just so much great stuff to say </v>

21
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>about Nolan that we have to make three </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos in order to do his work justice.</v>

22
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.373
<v Speaker 1>So sit back in your recliner chair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to this epic wisecrack Imax 70 </v>

23
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>millimeter presentation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of Christopher Nolan,</v>

24
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>part one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course spoilers ahead,</v>

25
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.963
<v Speaker 1>Christopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan's films can be broken down into </v>

26
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>three distinct phases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self,</v>

27
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the universe.</v>

28
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.593
<v Speaker 1>The first phase we'll discuss the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes Nolan's early work following </v>

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Momento,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insomnia,</v>

30
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.043
<v Speaker 1>and the prestige as well as inception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These films questioned the nature of </v>

31
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>personhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we ever truly know someone else?</v>

32
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Can we know ourselves in our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

33
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

34
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>what even is a person to better </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how these questions develop </v>

35
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:37.694
<v Speaker 1>and Nolan's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're first going to have to learn a </v>

36
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:39.774
<v Speaker 1>little something about what French </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Paul record calls the </v>

37
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>hermeneutics of suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as the cool kids say,</v>

38
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Hos hermeneutics studies how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret text.</v>

39
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.363
<v Speaker 1>Think of how a biblical verse can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted any number of ways Christ's </v>

40
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>crucifixion could be thought of as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegorical,</v>

41
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even literal story.</v>

42
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Hermeneutics looks at all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different interpretations.</v>

43
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.064
<v Speaker 1>Focusing on the methodologies people use</v>
<v Speaker 1>to justify their interpretations and </v>

44
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not just biblical texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

45
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>literary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical.</v>

46
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much any text you can think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>falls within hermeneutics.</v>

47
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.733
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean wisecrack is basically just one </v>

48
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>giant site dedicated to hermeneutics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we do is interpret text,</v>

49
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

50
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>

51
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but record questions.</v>

52
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>These so called interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying a group of outside the box.</v>

53
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.014
<v Speaker 1>Philosophers committed to drawing out </v>
<v Speaker 1>less visible and flattering Truett's </v>

54
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.393
<v Speaker 1>record called this group the school of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion which sort of sounds like an </v>

55
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.654
<v Speaker 1>erotic French thriller starring </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte rampling and Ludovic saying </v>

56
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.713
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately it's just three dudes </v>

57
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>with facial hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich Nietzsche,</v>

58
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Sigmund Freud.</v>

59
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>According to record these figures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lineage day inspired,</v>

60
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>we're committed to unmasking the lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and illusions of consciousness.</v>

61
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>They circumvented self evident meanings </v>
<v Speaker 1>in text,</v>

62
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.363
<v Speaker 1>focusing on what wasn't said and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions within all to decode a </v>

63
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>true disguised meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while religious stories like Christ's</v>

64
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.834
<v Speaker 1>resurrection may seem to be about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>man achieve salvation for the school of </v>

65
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:08.944
<v Speaker 1>suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories disguised a hidden </v>

66
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.524
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark stated that the true purpose of </v>

67
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>religious narratives were to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>misery of life more endurable,</v>

68
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Micha unmasked religion as the refuge </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the week,</v>

69
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.553
<v Speaker 1>giving purpose to the mentally fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Freud thought that religion was an </v>

70
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>illusion that substituted ones wished </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a father with God.</v>

71
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Now yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hermeneutics of suspicion typically only</v>

72
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>applies to text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be used more broadly to refer</v>

73
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:34.834
<v Speaker 1>to any so called interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hold a self evident and what's more </v>

74
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>self evident and well ourselves.</v>

75
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.253
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you youtube viewers watching this video </v>

76
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>with your eight tabs open and fidget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinner in hand,</v>

77
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.623
<v Speaker 1>what we drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch where fink believe all inform how </v>

78
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>we interpret ourselves and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like the Hos Nolan questions,</v>

79
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>the conclusions that come from standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>

80
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.863
<v Speaker 1>He confounds our assumed knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging our presuppositions to </v>

81
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>reveal deeper disguised truths about who</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell we really are.</v>

82
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.543
<v Speaker 1>Nolan's films are always about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious relation between our </v>

83
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>subjective reality and the idea of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective reality.</v>

84
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.893
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might sound like idealism to the </v>

85
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.364
<v Speaker 1>philosophically inclined among you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not arguing that Nolan </v>

86
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.674
<v Speaker 1>dismisses any external reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather he embraces a critical </v>

87
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>disposition toward the accepted notions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the self.</v>

88
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Take Christopher Nolan's debut following</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black and white indy follows billy,</v>

89
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.033
<v Speaker 1>a struggling writer who obsessively </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched people from afar to get </v>

90
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:33.964
<v Speaker 1>inspiration for his novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day he follows a well dressed thief </v>

91
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>named cobb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

92
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After he robbed a house,</v>

93
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>cobb quickly notices billy watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of running away or attacking</v>

94
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.294
<v Speaker 1>the stocker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he invites billy to join in on his </v>

95
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>robberies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interested now see,</v>

96
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:51.274
<v Speaker 1>cobb is far less interested in stealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>precious items than in figuring out the </v>

97
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>lives of people through their </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessions,</v>

98
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.120
<v Speaker 1>freaking in entering someone's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out who they really are.</v>

99
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Both cobb and billy interpret and </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct their own images of people,</v>

100
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.723
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he by following strangers around and </v>

101
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Cobb by breaking into people's homes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifling through their belongings.</v>

102
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.063
<v Speaker 1>But Nolan immediately questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If these conclusions hold any merit </v>

103
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>suggesting you can't rely on appearances</v>
<v Speaker 1>in possessions to define a person,</v>

104
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>as cop himself says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when burglarizing a house,</v>

105
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 1>take it away for cub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violating a person's property forces his</v>

106
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>victims to reevaluate themselves.</v>

107
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.933
<v Speaker 1>When the possessions people hold dear </v>
<v Speaker 1>are taken away or altered it in effect </v>

108
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>causes them to question their identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan also questions peoples reliance on</v>

109
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carb urges billy to cut his hair and don</v>

110
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:44.584
<v Speaker 1>his same suits which bill he immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>does because he wants to be just like </v>

111
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>his mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is all a setup.</v>

112
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.813
<v Speaker 1>The blonde woman is working with Cobb to</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame building the earlier break in and </v>

113
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>make over just a long con on the poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>

114
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Billy's own presuppositions of cop are </v>
<v Speaker 1>revealed to be false,</v>

115
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.043
<v Speaker 1>a far more dastardly intent lurking </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneath his friendly smile and </v>

116
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.334
<v Speaker 1>mentorship.</v>

117
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Compliment Nolan's</v>

118
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>suspicion towards using possessions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance to define others carries over</v>

119
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>to his next feature momento the film's </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonists.</v>

120
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Leonard suffers from anterograde Amnesia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and relies on a series of possessions,</v>

121
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notes,</v>

122
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.893
<v Speaker 1>and tattoos to remind himself of who the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around him are and whether they </v>

123
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.214
<v Speaker 1>can be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonard puts complete faith in these </v>

124
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>items depending on them exclusively to </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide his actions.</v>

125
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>He trusts natalie because his notes tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to be kills teddy because again,</v>

126
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.513
<v Speaker 1>his notes tell him to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the one he believes the car parked </v>

127
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:47.894
<v Speaker 1>outside his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his because he has a photograph that </v>

128
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>tells himself</v>

129
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 2>my car is your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

130
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 2>you're in a playful mood,</v>

131
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but of course these momentos aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as reliable as Leonard belief.</v>

132
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 2>He don't even know my name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teddy [inaudible].</v>

133
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:02.590
<v Speaker 2>You read it off of the picture.</v>

134
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.543
<v Speaker 1>Nolan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in true hos fashion creates drama by </v>

135
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:08.680
<v Speaker 1>throwing suspicion toward the validity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of texts.</v>

136
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.390
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs,</v>

137
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:11.740
<v Speaker 1>notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tattoos.</v>

138
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 1>How can we trust something we read if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the source itself is questionable?</v>

139
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Truth is Natalie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be trusted.</v>

140
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.390
<v Speaker 1>That car parked out front actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't belong to Leonard and Teddy.</v>

141
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not the guy.</v>

142
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Leonard could kill it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonard may say,</v>

143
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go on facts,</v>

144
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:28.410
<v Speaker 2>not recommendations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thank you,</v>

145
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>but if the truths these facts are based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on are incorrect,</v>

146
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.043
<v Speaker 1>then what use are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan constantly draws a distinction </v>

147
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>between Leonard subjective reality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of objective truth.</v>

148
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we were trying to do is essentially</v>

149
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.784
<v Speaker 3>present a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an idea of the tension between a </v>

150
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:48.604
<v Speaker 3>subjective view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the subjective way in which we have to </v>

151
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:51.844
<v Speaker 3>experience life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then our faith in an objective </v>

152
00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beyond that,</v>

153
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.183
<v Speaker 1>in Leonard's subjective view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a husband avenging the rape and </v>

154
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>murder of his wife after a break in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the film reveals,</v>

155
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 1>his wife actually survived this initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

156
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It was Leonard who accidentally killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

157
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>forgetting he had already given her her </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin shot.</v>

158
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.813
<v Speaker 1>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonard actually already caught and </v>

159
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>murdered his wife's rapist over a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

160
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.733
<v Speaker 1>He uses text to trick himself into </v>
<v Speaker 1>believing that this idealized revenge </v>

161
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>mission still exists.</v>

162
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.083
<v Speaker 2>You don't want the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make up your own truth like he </v>

163
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.183
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was complete when I gave it to you </v>

164
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.330
<v Speaker 2>who took out the 12 pages?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

165
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.630
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't me saying was you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to create a puzzle.</v>

166
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:38.770
<v Speaker 2>You could never solve</v>

167
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.733
<v Speaker 1>Leonard conditions themselves to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lives he's created to the point </v>

168
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>where even his own longterm memories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fabricated.</v>

169
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.603
<v Speaker 1>He substitutes the story of Sammy Jankis</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his own so he doesn't have to live </v>

170
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>with the guilt of accidentally murdering</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife.</v>

171
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Nolan here extends the Hermeneutics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion from simple texts.</v>

172
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Leonard's unreliable notes to Leonard </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

173
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>his own false memories.</v>

174
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I lie to myself to be happy in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

175
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Teddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

176
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.313
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

177
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 1>This suspicion continues into Nolan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>third feature insomnia,</v>

178
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>wherein Momento Leonard is an unreliable</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrator who's unable to discern reality</v>

179
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 1>from his own fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insomnia's chief protagonists,</v>

180
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 1>detective will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dormer seems to be the opposite.</v>

181
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 1>He's reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

182
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>and perceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if momento focused on a broken man,</v>

183
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.134
<v Speaker 1>attempting to rebuild his sense of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>insomnia takes the counter approach </v>

184
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.813
<v Speaker 1>showing how even the most rock solid guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say an Alpha Chino can crumble in </v>

185
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>the self doubt with just a little push.</v>

186
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.471
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>madness,</v>

187
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like gravity.</v>

188
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 2>All it takes is a little push</v>

189
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.690
<v Speaker 1>hold up ledger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to you in part two anyway,</v>

190
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:53.750
<v Speaker 1>after will mistakenly shoots his partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fog.</v>

191
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.673
<v Speaker 1>The guilt of the event triggers intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological confusion and well </v>

192
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:01.850
<v Speaker 1>insomnia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hallucinates his dead partner room,</v>

193
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>seemed to distort around will and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday noises become blisteringly.</v>

194
00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Irritating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

195
00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:08.624
<v Speaker 1>we'll hallucinates that he actually did </v>
<v Speaker 1>see his partner in the fog and that he </v>

196
00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:15.050
<v Speaker 1>deliberately shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike momento insomnia,</v>

197
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:18.260
<v Speaker 1>provides no clear explanation about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is true,</v>

198
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 1>did will deliberately shoot his partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was it just an accident?</v>

199
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>The answer who knows Nolan yet again </v>
<v Speaker 1>extends the Hermeneutics of suspicion.</v>

200
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.783
<v Speaker 1>Now questioning reality itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he implies it's much more complicated </v>

201
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:36.500
<v Speaker 1>than just accepting either pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectivity or subjective idealism.</v>

202
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we can't ever be sure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world around us by the end of insomnia.</v>

203
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Will doesn't even know if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately shot his partner or not.</v>

204
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Did you mean to shoot hat anymore?</v>

205
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.343
<v Speaker 1>The Prestige is pretty much Nolan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest hits as he tackles all the </v>

206
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>hermeneutics of suspicion from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier work.</v>

207
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 1>They'll film is told through a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>journals,</v>

208
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 1>many of which are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

209
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:07.641
<v Speaker 1>casting suspicion on good old texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the films magicians use disguises</v>

210
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:08.574
<v Speaker 1>to mask their tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Great Chung Lynn Sue pretends to be </v>

211
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>a cripple Alford borden where's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disguises to mask that he has a twin and</v>

212
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:16.344
<v Speaker 1>both Alfred and his Frenemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert and repeatedly pretend to be </v>

213
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 1>audience members like in following and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Momento.</v>

214
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Appearances can't be trusted and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self is constantly put into doubt.</v>

215
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Even Alfred's own wife doesn't know his </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret,</v>

216
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>confused that her husband could be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>loving one day and so cold,</v>

217
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Speaker 1>the next unaware of the existence of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband's twin.</v>

218
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I love you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some days it's not true today.</v>

219
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you today.</v>

220
00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:46.804
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

221
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.643
<v Speaker 1>No one uses magic yet again to question </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective reality versus the idea of </v>

222
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:52.474
<v Speaker 1>objective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the audience's subjective point of </v>

223
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:55.984
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bird really does disappear and then </v>

224
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>reappear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality,</v>

225
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>there were actually two twin birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one dead beneath the table,</v>

226
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 1>the other reappearing and the magician's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

227
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.913
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

228
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.773
<v Speaker 1>just asthma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mentos Leonard prefers to live in the </v>

229
00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:17.280
<v Speaker 1>illusion of is manipulated subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

230
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.550
<v Speaker 1>The audience to prefers illusion over </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

231
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.623
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to know how Robert </v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally duplicating himself each </v>

232
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.793
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murdering his double in a water tank </v>

233
00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:28.044
<v Speaker 1>beneath the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd much rather live under the lie </v>

234
00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:31.254
<v Speaker 1>that Robert Disappears and then suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>reappears on the opposite end of the </v>

235
00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:35.334
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

236
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.600
<v Speaker 2>People actually believes the things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did on stage.</v>

237
00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't clap that screaming</v>

238
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.423
<v Speaker 1>as a filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan views himself like these </v>

239
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:45.810
<v Speaker 1>magicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays with illusion and Mr.</v>

240
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Direction to keep the audience guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that we're watching a movie,</v>

241
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.753
<v Speaker 1>a projection on a screen and illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really want to know this </v>

242
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:55.134
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we revel in the imaginary world that </v>

243
00:12:57.331 --> 00:12:58.164
<v Speaker 1>Nolan has crafted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what Nolan ultimately wants to </v>

244
00:13:00.991 --> 00:13:04.050
<v Speaker 1>affect the audience through trickery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For him,</v>

245
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the truth deep down is that we prefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the imaginary over reality.</v>

246
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 2>What is knows the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solid</v>

247
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Nolan suspicion towards reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climaxes in inception of film work,</v>

248
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 1>every single thing is put into doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy who looks like Tom Berenger,</v>

249
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually Tom Hardy,</v>

250
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 1>can trust your eyes that thought you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just had.</v>

251
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It's actually been implanted by Leonardo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dicaprio.</v>

252
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Can't trust yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children waiting to play outside.</v>

253
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all a dream.</v>

254
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe can't trust anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inceptions protagonists,</v>

255
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>dream thief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carb.</v>

256
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.203
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that one can barely discern his </v>

257
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.574
<v Speaker 1>reality from a dream to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even matter in Cobb's </v>

258
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 1>supposed reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on the run,</v>

259
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:12.470
<v Speaker 1>chased by goons with guns through </v>
<v Speaker 1>Byzantine pathways in Cobb,</v>

260
00:14:12.471 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>supposed to dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's well still on the run,</v>

261
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 1>chased by goons with guns through </v>
<v Speaker 1>Byzantine pathways,</v>

262
00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 2>chase around the globe by anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations and these courses and where</v>

263
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.740
<v Speaker 2>the protections persecute the dream to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

264
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.460
<v Speaker 2>You don't believe in one reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

265
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.563
<v Speaker 1>Nolan deliberately draws this parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>to showcase how muddled the two are put </v>

266
00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:35.720
<v Speaker 1>simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no difference between dream and</v>

267
00:14:35.721 --> 00:14:39.230
<v Speaker 1>reality because subjectively cop can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the difference,</v>

268
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.460
<v Speaker 1>such as the fate for COBB's wife mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She believes that her reality is still a</v>

269
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:46.070
<v Speaker 1>dream and to wake up she must kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>

270
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.273
<v Speaker 2>Possessed by an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one very simple idea and changed </v>

271
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:54.524
<v Speaker 2>everything that our world wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She needed to wake up to come back to </v>

272
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:01.214
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

273
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.010
<v Speaker 1>but what is malts actually right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if cobb has been dreaming the whole</v>

274
00:15:05.011 --> 00:15:06.600
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you're wrong?</v>

275
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.730
<v Speaker 1>What if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's real,</v>

276
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.623
<v Speaker 1>no definitive answer is ever given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly Nolan's point in the </v>

277
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.393
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the question remains that last </v>

278
00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>indelible image of that Damn spinnings </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopped,</v>

279
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.330
<v Speaker 1>spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just slightly wavering,</v>

280
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.193
<v Speaker 1>provides no definitive answer as to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>carb is dreaming or awake only further </v>

281
00:15:26.101 --> 00:15:28.740
<v Speaker 1>proving that in the end there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

282
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.740
<v Speaker 1>no reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the suspicion thereof,</v>

283
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.750
<v Speaker 1>well at least until we get to part </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

284
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.800
<v Speaker 1>through each of Nolan's early films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he casts doubt on appearances,</v>

285
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.630
<v Speaker 1>on possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on others,</v>

286
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.520
<v Speaker 1>on ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our thoughts,</v>

287
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.443
<v Speaker 1>and finally on reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't trust anybody else and </v>

288
00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:46.434
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust yourself and holy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even trust the reality </v>

289
00:15:49.021 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 1>surrounding you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how the hell does society function?</v>

290
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.320
<v Speaker 1>How can people come together and form a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable working unit?</v>

291
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Given the foundational bedrock is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonky?</v>

292
00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.033
<v Speaker 1>This is the question,</v>
