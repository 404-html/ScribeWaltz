00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.070
<v Speaker 1>What's up wise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crack,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.913
<v Speaker 1>jared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.783
<v Speaker 1>Jurassic world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen kingdom has been absolutely </v>

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>obliterated by critics and audiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>alike.</v>

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Calling out it's unfunny character's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of originality and worst of all,</v>

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>the unforgivable sin of not enough cif </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold flute.</v>

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.583
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lot to be said about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest Jurassic movies haven't </v>

8
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>amazed us in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg's 1993 original did,</v>

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.173
<v Speaker 1>but at least Jurassic world seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat aware of its inherent </v>

10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>no one's impressed by a dinosaur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Jurassic world follow up.</v>

12
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Falling Kingdom shows how far the </v>
<v Speaker 1>franchise has fallen on paper,</v>

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:41.904
<v Speaker 1>though it actually seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something going for it because unlike </v>

14
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.474
<v Speaker 1>it's 2015 predecessor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie actually tries to develop the </v>

15
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>underlying moral question of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It moves from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should dinosaurs be brought back to life</v>

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.283
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we consciously let dinosaurs go </v>

18
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:58.164
<v Speaker 1>extinct again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can deny that fallen kingdom </v>

19
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:01.104
<v Speaker 1>looks absolutely stunning at times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite the magicians of dollars </v>

20
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>thrown at the special effects budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie is still so boring.</v>

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So why aren't we more immersed than </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever?</v>

22
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out in this wise crack </v>

23
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>condition on Jurassic world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen kingdom.</v>

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And spoilers ahead if anyone cares.</v>

25
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.053
<v Speaker 1>Let's briefly recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who've already left </v>

26
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.754
<v Speaker 1>this movie go extinct in their minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the destruction of Jurassic world </v>

27
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>at the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in dominous rex,</v>

28
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>the dinosaurs are left to run the island</v>
<v Speaker 1>freely once more.</v>

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.753
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast forward three years and a volcano </v>

30
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.214
<v Speaker 1>on the island is about to blast little </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot and ducky into extinction once </v>

31
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and then claire,</v>

32
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>don't lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you forgot their names too.</v>

33
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Don't want this to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And join a rescue team in an effort to </v>

34
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.474
<v Speaker 1>save as many of the species as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the stage is set presenting us with </v>

35
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:50.634
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most action packed high </v>
<v Speaker 1>stakes situation and Jurassic Park </v>

36
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.864
<v Speaker 1>history while simultaneously evoking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main ethical and moral questions that </v>

37
00:01:58.621 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>made the original.</v>

38
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.293
<v Speaker 1>So beloved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we take responsibility for our </v>

39
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>own creations and save the dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their second extinction?</v>

40
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.073
<v Speaker 1>Or should we bow down to mother nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and let the volcano deal with our </v>

41
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>incompetence once and for all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what we got here.</v>

42
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Developing themes from the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

43
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.373
<v Speaker 1>sweet digital effects and action check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's favorite killing machine </v>

44
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what could possibly go wrong?</v>

45
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.783
<v Speaker 1>Life finds a way by contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original Jurassic Park came out 25 </v>

46
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>whole years ago in a time when CGI was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still in its infancy.</v>

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.073
<v Speaker 1>So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of computerized dinosaurs </v>

48
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>featured in the original aren't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to par with today's CGI.</v>

49
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.143
<v Speaker 1>So why is it then that the age action </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequences in Jurassic Park still feel </v>

50
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>more engaging and memorable than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visually superior set pieces have fallen</v>

51
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>kingdom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To answer this question,</v>

52
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.244
<v Speaker 1>we need to go back to the man who </v>
<v Speaker 1>started at all Steven Spielberg and his </v>

53
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>own words.</v>

54
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.193
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg avoided making just another </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster movie and this was not going to </v>

55
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>be a genre of horror science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy.</v>

56
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.263
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want Jurassic Park to revolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>around scary monsters chasing after </v>

57
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.984
<v Speaker 1>helpless one dimensional characters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said he wanted the film to focus on the </v>

58
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.214
<v Speaker 1>journey of a group of relatable </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters who have to deal with the </v>

59
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>reality that dinosaurs have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly brought back to life.</v>

60
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.933
<v Speaker 1>For Spielberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original drastic park was a human </v>

61
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:24.844
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not date dinosaurs eating people's </v>

62
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about the visual spectacle</v>

63
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>of witnessing a man getting eaten off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the toilet by a dinosaur,</v>

64
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.503
<v Speaker 1>but the emotional journeys of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and it's with this knowledge </v>

65
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 1>in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be uncover why this is infinitely </v>

66
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>less yon inducing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then this insanity take for instance the</v>

67
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:44.824
<v Speaker 1>now iconic t-rex scene in Jurassic Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as our protagonists are passing by </v>

68
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>the enclosure of the king of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs,</v>

69
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.023
<v Speaker 1>the park's power grid is suddenly turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>off leaving the mighty rex free to go </v>

70
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>wherever she pleases.</v>

71
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.263
<v Speaker 1>The biggest man eating animal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world escapes and our protagonists are </v>

72
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.374
<v Speaker 1>the first pray to cross her path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What follows is a roughly six minute </v>

73
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>action suspense sequence in which our </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist try their best.</v>

74
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getty seems pretty straightforward,</v>

75
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.923
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the characters trying to </v>

77
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>survive is what is literally happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the screen.</v>

78
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.173
<v Speaker 1>It's what's going on under the surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matters from a story perspective </v>

79
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>isn't as much about the introduction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the t rex as it is about the protagonist</v>

80
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.593
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Grant learning to become a father </v>

81
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're introduced to the idea that Dr.</v>

82
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.043
<v Speaker 1>Grant is not exactly the kind of guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>lets his nephew when at super smash </v>

83
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

84
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:39.784
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg really tries to hammer home </v>
<v Speaker 1>that grant doesn't like kids and would </v>

85
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>rather remain obsessed with the dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

86
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Then thinking about creating life in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

87
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you want to have one of those.</v>

88
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>We're also briefly notified that Hammons</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter of the mom of these two kids is</v>

89
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.270
<v Speaker 1>going through a divorce and you telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that Hannah Kinney,</v>

90
00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>have you gone in to see me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to leave early.</v>

91
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be with these daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's getting a divorce.</v>

92
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.734
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though we're all just anxiously </v>

93
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:06.620
<v Speaker 1>waiting to see newman gets skeeted on by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Deloft,</v>

94
00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:07.454
<v Speaker 1>the source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage is set for the underlying </v>

95
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>theme of the movie family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's head back to that pivotal scene.</v>

96
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.003
<v Speaker 1>Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only adult in the car with the kids </v>

97
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.403
<v Speaker 1>suddenly feels his breakfast Burrito </v>
<v Speaker 1>twirling around in his bowels and </v>

98
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>decides to dip out and head to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearest bathroom.</v>

99
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.063
<v Speaker 1>The kids having been abandoned by yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>another male authority figure are alone </v>

100
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>and panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

101
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Grant immediately realizes he has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a decision.</v>

102
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>He can either remain still and decrease </v>
<v Speaker 1>his chances of getting eaten or act in a</v>

103
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>selfless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat fatherly manner.</v>

104
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Alan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one repression of father instincts zero.</v>

105
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>It's moments like this that elevate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action from Amir.</v>

106
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Will they survive to how will the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters grow as they try to survive?</v>

107
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.233
<v Speaker 1>So when good old rexy breaks through her</v>
<v Speaker 1>own glass ceiling at the start of a </v>

108
00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just mere spectacle,</v>

109
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>it's action in service of character </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth and theme.</v>

110
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It engages us not just because it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

111
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>but because we can relate to the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a personal level.</v>

112
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Jurassic world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen kingdom,</v>

113
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has almost none of this.</v>

114
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.493
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the start of the story were </v>

115
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:14.384
<v Speaker 1>reintroduced to be moral and ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions surrounding the survival or </v>

116
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.314
<v Speaker 1>demise of the dinosaurs on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do dinosaurs deserve the same </v>

117
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>protections given to other endangered </v>
<v Speaker 1>species or should they be left to die?</v>

118
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>But we learn next to nothing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal lives of the protagonists.</v>

119
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.883
<v Speaker 1>So even though its main action set piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be visually far more impressive </v>

120
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>than the t rex scene without this </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying layer,</v>

121
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>what you see is what you get Chris Pratt</v>
<v Speaker 1>running away from dinosaurs and lava.</v>

122
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>It might be a feast for the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it starves us emotionally.</v>

123
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.933
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at another example from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original right after the t rex breakout </v>

124
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan has to try and save timmy who still</v>

125
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>trapped in this car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for them,</v>

126
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.293
<v Speaker 1>this tree can't hold the cars weight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about the drop and crush our </v>

127
00:06:59.091 --> 00:06:59.924
<v Speaker 1>protagonists to death in fallen kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see a similar action sequence unfold </v>

128
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>when Claire and Franklin have to climb a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder to escape a hungry dinosaur whose</v>

129
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 1>only barely being held back by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dripping wall of lava.</v>

130
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem too different from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling car setup,</v>

131
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

132
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:15.824
<v Speaker 1>the difference here is that this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 drastic park isn't just a random </v>

133
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:19.394
<v Speaker 1>moment for the sake of suspense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it again serves to develop the </v>

134
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>theme of the story.</v>

135
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Just like can you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she asked.</v>

136
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:26.294
<v Speaker 1>His Dad is affiliate treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan is again forced into a position in </v>

137
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 1>which he has to act as a father in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to save timmies life,</v>

138
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.023
<v Speaker 1>and even the climax of the sequence with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan and timmy miraculously surviving </v>

139
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.374
<v Speaker 1>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling down on them serves a purpose </v>

140
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.583
<v Speaker 1>instead of just being a copout cliche to</v>
<v Speaker 1>trick the audience into thinking that </v>

141
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.664
<v Speaker 1>the characters have died on the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This moment is used to show the </v>

142
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical rebirth of Allen like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur from an egg.</v>

143
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 1>He's no longer the dinosaur obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>child diverse man he once was,</v>

144
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but instead has embraced the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being a future father.</v>

145
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an action scene packed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and yeah,</v>

146
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you probably guessed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falling Kingdom has nothing like this,</v>

147
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.663
<v Speaker 1>like Alan and Timmy Clare and Franklin </v>
<v Speaker 1>also barely escaped their deaths in the </v>

148
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 1>nick of time.</v>

149
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.643
<v Speaker 1>But that's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing about the characters or their </v>

150
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:19.724
<v Speaker 1>relationship has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no meaning to it beyond </v>

151
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.683
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what could have been a visualization </v>

152
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:27.284
<v Speaker 1>of their inner growth ends up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>another vapid spectacle since the </v>

153
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:31.424
<v Speaker 1>characters remained virtually the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason why this action scenes </v>

154
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.224
<v Speaker 1>still grabs us 25 years after its </v>
<v Speaker 1>inception is not just because it first </v>

155
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:41.804
<v Speaker 1>introduced us to the t rex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of how it uses action in </v>

156
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:49.871
<v Speaker 1>service of the underlying story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells two stories at the same time.</v>

157
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>One that excites us and add suspense and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that people can truly relate to.</v>

158
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Combine the two and you have an action </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence that engages audiences across </v>

159
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how prehistoric it's visuals,</v>

160
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>all the pieces were there to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly enjoyable and memorable film,</v>

161
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.403
<v Speaker 1>perhaps equaling or even surpassing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original a film with the same sort of </v>

162
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:11.934
<v Speaker 1>engaging emotional subtext as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original combined with the advancement </v>

163
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 1>in digital effects could have made for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something truly special.</v>

164
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.673
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some people had a blast </v>

165
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 1>watching Chris Pratt runaway from </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs and giant melting rocks,</v>

166
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.853
<v Speaker 1>but will these scene still truly live on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the minds of those same people 25 </v>

167
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 1>years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

168
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.053
<v Speaker 1>we have doubts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least Trev row in Bayona made sure </v>

169
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:36.204
<v Speaker 1>that the series wouldn't evolve further </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a mindless monster movie by </v>

170
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>repeating the same mistake Spielberg </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in the lost world.</v>

171
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:44.703
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

172
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:48.763
<v Speaker 1>if you're sad that all the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs went the way the fidget </v>

173
00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:51.914
<v Speaker 1>spinner don't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually plenty of prehistoric </v>

174
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:57.110
<v Speaker 1>monsters that's still roam the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the best of my knowledge,</v>

175
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.840
<v Speaker 1>none of them will go all newman on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take,</v>

176
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great salamander,</v>

177
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:06.290
<v Speaker 1>who for the past 160 million years has </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained relatively unchanged,</v>

178
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.250
<v Speaker 1>and there is a version of it that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty that early American settlers named</v>

179
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:12.950
<v Speaker 1>it after health fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to learn all about that,</v>

180

<v Speaker 1>you got to check out the newest video </v>

<v Speaker 1>know about animals from the antelope </v>

185

<v Speaker 1>that looked like they're straight out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>star wars.</v>

186
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Two wasps that I honestly never want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see in my life.</v>
