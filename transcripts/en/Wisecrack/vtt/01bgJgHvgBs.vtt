1
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>That was the vision of literature for </v>
<v Speaker 1>six a all the time.</v>

2
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.093
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm a very exceptional </v>

3
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:19.334
<v Speaker 1>case because simply in our daily life we</v>
<v Speaker 1>approached sex either as a pleasure or </v>

4
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>as a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>for literature six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that would say even I don't like very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the term six.</v>

7
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say the physical relation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

8
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Then the physical relationship between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>between two partners are in lethbridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>means much more because you need sex not</v>

10
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>only for pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you need,</v>

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

12
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to perform a physical relation with your</v>

13
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:59.201
<v Speaker 1>partner because you are scared or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are disparate or because you</v>

14
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>are looking for intimacy or because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be protected by a mother,</v>

15
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a order,</v>

16
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:08.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would like to discover your partner </v>

17
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>or to take control many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a very rich human domain.</v>

18
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Accordingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very rich,</v>

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later in the field.</v>

20
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot ignore sexual physical </v>

21
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>relation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literature is many things more than just</v>

22
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>the pleasure you see or you achieved the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure through many,</v>

23
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>many roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

24
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>it is an art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a way to express yourself.</v>

26
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It is even a way to discover the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a way to discover your partner.</v>

27
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you know really your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner without having sex with him or </v>

28
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

29
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>because this is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a moment of truth.</v>

30
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.653
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could discover your feelings </v>

31
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>after having the physical relation much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than before.</v>

32
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.003
<v Speaker 1>You see what is left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in the few seconds after the </v>

33
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical pleasure,</v>

34
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>then you discover exactly how much you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel for this person.</v>

35
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.310
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

36
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>very mysterious and reach moment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordingly.</v>

37
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a big challenge for a fixture.</v>
