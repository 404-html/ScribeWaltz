00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.340
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared,</v>

2
00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:06.530
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you guys probably think of key and</v>

3
00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:07.364
<v Speaker 1>Peele as the duo that gave us president </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama's anger translator or the </v>

4
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>visionaries that finally made an action </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie about a kitten,</v>

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.293
<v Speaker 1>they're also responsible for some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartest comedy that's reasonably grace </v>

6
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:18.014
<v Speaker 1>the airwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while much of their success can be </v>

7
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>chalked up to their unique and often </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd characters,</v>

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.163
<v Speaker 1>they're true brilliance lies and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>streamlined writing style and a </v>

9
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>commitment to sketches that are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>He wrote town like Atlanta as they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially and emotionally true.</v>

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to need rope tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you are.</v>

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And how do they tell that truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>let's find out since nothing is better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than overexplaining a joke.</v>

14
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.363
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wise crack condition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>key and Peele and I guess there's sort </v>

15
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>of spoilers ahead to really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes key and Peele so great.</v>

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.733
<v Speaker 1>We need to look a bit deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover the comedic philosophy that </v>

17
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>informs their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe it or not,</v>

18
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>these guys follow in the footsteps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.233
<v Speaker 1>the door through which you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you unfamiliar that isn't </v>

20
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>the Demon lovechild of Dan Harmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Morin's,</v>

21
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Levoy Jijak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's del close,</v>

22
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>a pioneer of comedy who still hugely </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential today,</v>

23
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into how key and peele</v>
<v Speaker 1>embody closest comedic philosophy,</v>

24
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>we need to take a look at a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy science.</v>

25
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>While you probably don't associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>science with comedy,</v>

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.283
<v Speaker 1>who can better understand the success of</v>
<v Speaker 1>many key and peele sketches by </v>

27
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 1>distilling them down to a core comedic </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

28
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.793
<v Speaker 1>In this structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start in a world with a built in set </v>

29
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>of expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is then contrasted with an unusual</v>

30
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>behavior and this behavior is heightened</v>
<v Speaker 1>and explored until you've pissed herself</v>

31
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.134
<v Speaker 1>from laughing so hard and other the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words comedy is arrived at through </v>

32
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:45.524
<v Speaker 1>exploring a behavior that breaks with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectations we have of a given </v>

33
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:49.664
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

34
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>If we wanted to go full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful mind on this structure,</v>

35
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>it might look a little something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

36
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.113
<v Speaker 1>Reasonable reality instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations plus unusual behavior and </v>

37
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:00.374
<v Speaker 1>or point of view multiplied by raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stakes plus an ending which </v>

38
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>subverts established pattern equals </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy bliss,</v>

39
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.983
<v Speaker 1>but enough comedic calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at substitute teacher </v>

40
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:12.494
<v Speaker 1>as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The schedule opens in a high school </v>

41
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 1>classroom and environment that carries </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it a set of standard expectations.</v>

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Board students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chalkboards books,</v>

43
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>and a teacher trying to wield some </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

44
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>But all this changes when Mr Garvey </v>
<v Speaker 1>begins taking attendance.</v>

45
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 2>The colon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they call a net.</v>

46
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Kuala here.</v>

47
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 1>do you mean jacqueline?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that we have are unusual behavior?</v>

49
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.103
<v Speaker 1>I he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Garvey's inability to pronounce </v>

50
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>stereotypically white names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things can really get cooking.</v>

51
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>We get to see both the logic behind Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Garvey's frustration.</v>

52
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.523
<v Speaker 1>I'm the rail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rail along with the increasingly </v>

53
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>terrified students as Mr Garvey </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues this unusual behavior is anger</v>

54
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.244
<v Speaker 1>increases while their fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This simple underlying logic is what </v>

55
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>helps accelerate the comedy with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

56
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.763
<v Speaker 1>Once we see this pattern repeated a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>times were already predicting the next </v>

57
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>they're not messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Rod,</v>

59
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>not to be bested by an attentive </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

60
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
<v Speaker 1>This sketch ends by flipping our </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations for once Mr Garvey gets it </v>

61
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:18.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Timothy [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

63
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how this pattern plays out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other sketches.</v>

64
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.403
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we expect to babysit babysitter to have </v>

65
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:31.160
<v Speaker 1>a quiet night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and unusual behaviors introduced</v>

66
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 4>google guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy I why milk</v>

67
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.600
<v Speaker 1>and this behavior gets emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened.</v>

68
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Your in charge of me in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

69
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.623
<v Speaker 1>can for forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time for bed with a last minute </v>

70
00:03:44.211 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>reveal that offers a glimpse into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedic logic.</v>

71
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Hush baby forrest whitaker don't say a </v>
<v Speaker 3>word guy.</v>

72
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Guy was going to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were mocking bird</v>

73
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.453
<v Speaker 1>in another sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start with a fairly mundane setting </v>

74
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>until we meet our unusual companions who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are intent on living there,</v>

75
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>vigilante air marshal dream.</v>

76
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.443
<v Speaker 4>I tell you one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not 11th or to happen up on it here </v>

77
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.720
<v Speaker 4>plain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry.</v>

78
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 4>We got there.</v>

79
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.810
<v Speaker 1>The stakes are then raised well above </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruising altitude.</v>

80
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 4>You know how mark and up that plane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh God.</v>

82
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And rather than fizzling out by running </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern to the ground,</v>

83
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>we get a surprise at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That reframes what we've just seen.</v>

84
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.793
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that sketches that don't follow </v>

85
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:36.920
<v Speaker 1>this pattern can also be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who can deny the pure joy of will?</v>

86
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:37.754
<v Speaker 1>Ferrell's gyrating midriff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta have my cop out or the wonder </v>

87
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 1>testicular double Entendre of Alec </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baldwin's baked goods.</v>

88
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 1>No one can resist my schweddy balls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

89
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Speaker 1>even key and peele occasionally basket </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the purely absurd.</v>

90
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

91
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

92
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Comedic structure is only half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

93
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>While they're sketches are certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

94
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.343
<v Speaker 1>it's another element of their work that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensures that they're also smart key </v>

95
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>appeals commitment to finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental human truth in comedy.</v>

96
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>This philosophy is not an invention of </v>
<v Speaker 1>key and peele.</v>

97
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.623
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both cut their comedic chops in </v>

98
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:12.664
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A city whose comedy scene is permeated </v>

99
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>by this guy del close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while you may not have heard of him,</v>

100
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.963
<v Speaker 1>he's responsible for training a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent comedians and along the way he </v>

101
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>helped write a book called truth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy with Sharna Halpern.</v>

102
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>That's become a Bible for comedians </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world in its,</v>

103
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.093
<v Speaker 1>they are you that the best comedy comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from mining the depths of human </v>

104
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:33.754
<v Speaker 1>existence and that this creates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds for comedy that is both funny </v>

105
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>and smart and idea that we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in key and peele.</v>

106
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.073
<v Speaker 1>Oh and del close once claimed that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coven of witches cured him of his </v>

107
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addiction.</v>

108
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>This has nothing to do with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's worth noting.</v>

109
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>This commitment to truth isn't exclusive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Chicago Comedians as this emotionally</v>

110
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:53.304
<v Speaker 1>honest style has dominated recently from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diner to the break room do the </v>

111
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:57.534
<v Speaker 1>streets of Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now does this commitment to truth mean </v>

112
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>that good comedy always has to reflect </v>
<v Speaker 1>on real and truthful situations?</v>

113
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.973
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But while a post apocalyptic alien </v>

114
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>invasion might not reflect the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world we live in,</v>

115
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.213
<v Speaker 1>sorry to anyone currently on acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core comedic idea is still grounded </v>

116
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.354
<v Speaker 1>in something fundamentally true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That key and peels characters can </v>

117
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>instantly know who is an alien by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to blackness.</v>

118
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.943
<v Speaker 1>How did you know</v>

119
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.020
<v Speaker 1>C'mon redneck wants us to move into his </v>
<v Speaker 1>community us.</v>

120
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The friendlier the white characters are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more certain they are of their alien</v>

121
00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:33.930
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you let me tell your daughter,</v>

122
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.013
<v Speaker 1>let's return to Mr Garvey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the truth that makes this sketch </v>

123
00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:43.530
<v Speaker 1>so funny for a start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sketch reverses the trope of a well</v>

124
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>intentioned teach for America type out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to save a bunch of inner city kids.</v>

125
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.413
<v Speaker 1>This role reversal produces both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate comedy of Mr Garvey's </v>

126
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.113
<v Speaker 1>mispronunciations and the socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious fact that this is something </v>

127
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:55.974
<v Speaker 1>that happens to minority students all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time except in that case it's more </v>

128
00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable than it is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

129
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Mr Garvey's reaction to a name like </v>
<v Speaker 1>denise and Aaron are hilarious.</v>

130
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Key and Peele are forcing us to ask a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complicated question.</v>

131
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.963
<v Speaker 1>What if black teachers where as </v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally incompetent as their white </v>

132
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:15.384
<v Speaker 1>counterparts and thus we have a double </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronged comedic attack come for the </v>

133
00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:21.450
<v Speaker 1>laughter and stay for the socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious criticism.</v>

134
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.523
<v Speaker 1>The benefit of this mixture of comedic </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and finding the truth is that </v>

135
00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.590
<v Speaker 1>hilarious sketches can be found in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>area of life,</v>

136
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.820
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

137
00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:32.010
<v Speaker 1>the dark side of professional sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You name it,</v>

138
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.993
<v Speaker 1>and they often do so by relating to </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal experience and their first </v>

139
00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:36.720
<v Speaker 1>sketch titled</v>

140
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Bay.</v>

141
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a focus on the tensions found in</v>
<v Speaker 1>black masculinity between being a strong</v>

142
00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Alpha male and a committed partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked this woman,</v>

143
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.663
<v Speaker 1>you told me six 45 you said that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketch heightens the limits that to </v>

144
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.184
<v Speaker 1>friends will go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep up the facade of being a hard </v>

145
00:07:59.141 --> 00:07:59.974
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting further and further away from </v>

146
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:06.364
<v Speaker 1>their spouses in the process and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar lengths they'll go to to </v>

147
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>maintain this facade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the actual effort,</v>

148
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.530
<v Speaker 1>man we'll put into prove they're one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bros.</v>

149
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.543
<v Speaker 1>And of course this sketch highlights the</v>
<v Speaker 1>absurdity of this whole macho </v>

150
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:21.934
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

151
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>This theme is also explored in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded key and Peele universe as their</v>

152
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>first feature film Keanu throws to </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal suburban black men into the world</v>

153
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:38.204
<v Speaker 1>of organized crime and drug dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have to impersonate to </v>

154
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.624
<v Speaker 1>legendary street assassins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point we see the two main </v>

155
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.044
<v Speaker 1>characters performing a stereotypical </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of black masculinity play Somnio </v>

156
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.950
<v Speaker 1>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And conversely,</v>

157
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.813
<v Speaker 1>we see some of the hardened gangsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought to tears by the music of George </v>

158
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.053
<v Speaker 1>Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use a similar strategy in the </v>

159
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:01.494
<v Speaker 1>sketch office homophobe where we see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense interaction between two office </v>

160
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.873
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't handle hearing about how I'm </v>

161
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:10.280
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

162
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.820
<v Speaker 1>You just referring to your boyfriend's </v>
<v Speaker 1>penis as a baby's arm holding an apple.</v>

163
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.210
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked like,</v>

164
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>which leads to a serious accusation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobic.</v>

165
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.323
<v Speaker 1>And while this sketch at first seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up a tired trope in which the humor </v>

166
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>is derived from a flamboyant gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotype.</v>

167
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

168
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:29.154
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to see up close the </v>

169
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>pitch of my anus cause you hate day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

170
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>This expectation is ended when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobes boyfriend shows up.</v>

171
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>It's my boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>

172
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.233
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which leads to a surprising realization </v>

173
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.014
<v Speaker 1>for keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Character.</v>

174
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not persecuted.</v>

175
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of this sketch,</v>

176
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.860
<v Speaker 1>well no matter your sexual preference or</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

177
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.843
<v Speaker 1>you can still be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more common source of comedic </v>

178
00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.620
<v Speaker 1>inspiration has always been good old </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

179
00:09:56.621 --> 00:09:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Religion and critiques of religion are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not new</v>

180
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.370
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to boots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big Time Major League.</v>

181
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 5>You have to stand in awe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in awe of the all time champion of false</v>

182
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:14.510
<v Speaker 5>promises and exaggerated claims religion</v>

183
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.603
<v Speaker 1>rather than following in the footsteps </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those who find comedy in skewering </v>

184
00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:19.114
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford's irrational claims key and peele </v>

185
00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:24.490
<v Speaker 1>find a much more human take on religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in particular Christianity.</v>

186
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.563
<v Speaker 1>The sketch opens with a group of earnest</v>
<v Speaker 1>believers in prayer and this group of </v>

187
00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Christians is rewarded with a visit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voice of God himself.</v>

188
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.323
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once God responds to their prayers with </v>

189
00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.000
<v Speaker 1>some practical next step,</v>

190
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.380
<v Speaker 6>so whole</v>

191
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.843
<v Speaker 1>they become slightly less enthused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they find a nice loophole to </v>

192
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 1>avoid having to actually follow God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>command of service.</v>

193
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.463
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

194
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.873
<v Speaker 1>sketch just so great because it offers a</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny critique of religion with some </v>

195
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 1>genuine theological nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joke isn't on religion in general or</v>

196
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:06.714
<v Speaker 1>believers in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather it points out the hub holocracy </v>

197
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:10.074
<v Speaker 1>of those unwilling to take their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious tradition seriously when it </v>

198
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>comes to following through on a not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun obligation.</v>

199
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>This critique is actually one founded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity itself.</v>

200
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>As the book of James Famously says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith without works is dead.</v>

201
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.143
<v Speaker 1>Even your most devout onto couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with this one and even more </v>

202
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 1>brutally honest social critique can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in their sketch sound off,</v>

203
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.583
<v Speaker 1>which is set at basic training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we assume that the drill sergeant </v>

204
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>is going to lead the song in some absurd</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

205
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.763
<v Speaker 1>it ends up finding comedy in a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh realism from Port Orford and </v>

206
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Armando Uris Hall are from all families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cow Fall,</v>

207
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:48.010
<v Speaker 1>we roam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold the rich church can just,</v>

208
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sketch doesn't only point out the </v>

209
00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:53.090
<v Speaker 1>disparity and who ends up fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>America's wars,</v>

210
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>but also the reality of what awaits </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers coming home from war.</v>

211
00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 7>When I come home with the kids when I </v>
<v Speaker 7>come home with PTSD,</v>

212
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.100
<v Speaker 7>the Va hospital,</v>

213
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.110
<v Speaker 1>somehow they managed to make a sketch </v>
<v Speaker 1>about economic inequality and inadequate</v>

214
00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:11.030
<v Speaker 1>medical care in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny,</v>

215
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.953
<v Speaker 1>while they have multiple sketches that </v>
<v Speaker 1>use the absurdity of football for </v>

216
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:16.460
<v Speaker 1>comedic fuel bootsie wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

217
00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:20.060
<v Speaker 1>he could call me todd royal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapping up Russia like aluminum foil in</v>

218
00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:20.894
<v Speaker 1>quarterback concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use the trope of the heroic </v>

219
00:12:22.941 --> 00:12:26.480
<v Speaker 1>quarterback to shine some light on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical reality of the game.</v>

220
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.463
<v Speaker 1>After taking a big hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the quarterback go from confused </v>

221
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.810
<v Speaker 1>seriously about what do we do it too </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly offering fictional baked good.</v>

222
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.320
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to.</v>

223
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.770
<v Speaker 7>Joe was ass man has put an apple pie to </v>
<v Speaker 7>go around</v>

224
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.120
<v Speaker 1>for getting diagnosed by a teammate.</v>

225
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.003
<v Speaker 7>You have a brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You need to get some medical and same </v>

226
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 7>suit</v>

227
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 1>after seemingly getting it together in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rousing chance of team spirit.</v>

228
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Quarterback notices a missing piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his identity as a rhino.</v>

229
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.780
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody stole my heart</v>

230
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.580
<v Speaker 1>runs off in an effective parody of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspirational sports movie genre key and</v>

231
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:03.414
<v Speaker 1>Peele or showing us what it would look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if these movies accurately </v>

232
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>represented the horrific injuries </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered by athletes.</v>

233
