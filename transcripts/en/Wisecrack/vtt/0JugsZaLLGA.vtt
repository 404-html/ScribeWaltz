00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I have a very strong opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all revolves overstatement 90 percent</v>

2
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>of it revolves around Israel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestine.</v>

3
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.213
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that Palestinians</v>
<v Speaker 1>also bleed and that they also have a </v>

4
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>legitimate grievance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israelis may also,</v>

5
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>but Palestinians in a nutshell are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>punished for something they did not do,</v>

6
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>which is commit the Holocaust until </v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestine or Palestinians are recognized</v>

7
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:45.854
<v Speaker 1>as having a grievance just as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israelis do and until that grievance is </v>

8
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:51.044
<v Speaker 1>addressed and addressed fairly not with </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls and not with little bits of </v>

9
00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>settlements scattered across the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank,</v>

10
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>but until it is equitably and fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>finalized,</v>

11
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you will not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will not have peace.</v>

12
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.543
<v Speaker 1>It will take Israel pulling back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1967 borders halting further settlement </v>

13
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing Palestinian refugees to return.</v>

14
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.873
<v Speaker 1>That's what it will take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That proposal has been on the table </v>

15
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>since 2002 from the Arab League and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Organization of Islamic Conference.</v>

16
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.763
<v Speaker 1>In exchange for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every country in both of those </v>

17
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:34.254
<v Speaker 1>organizations will recognize Israel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>will open up full diplomatic relations </v>

18
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six years.</v>

19
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>That proposal has been on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel has refused.</v>

20
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly a sympathetic Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>

21
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Israel helicopter's fire rockets </v>

22
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:00.854
<v Speaker 1>into some street and kill six people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a Hamas activist that is </v>

23
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:10.241
<v Speaker 1>reported that Israel killed six people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including one activist as opposed to say</v>

24
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:13.574
<v Speaker 1>CNN or Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will report that Israel killed </v>

25
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamas activist,</v>

26
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>and not mention those other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

27
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>there are front page photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 1>almost every day of the latest outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly skewed.</v>

29
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to look at,</v>

30
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is doing,</v>

31
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>who is committing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

32
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:41.621
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the violence since 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the statistics exactly,</v>

33
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>but something like 10 Palestinians have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been killed for every Israeli.</v>

34
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.473
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your hand if you've read that in </v>

35
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>the US newspaper lately.</v>
