1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.223
<v Speaker 1>In the entire universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two greatest scientific mysteries </v>

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the origin of the universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>

4
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the origin of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.653
<v Speaker 1>sitting on our shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the most complex object that mother </v>

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>nature has created in the known </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.683
<v Speaker 1>You have to go at least 24 trillion </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles to the nearest star defined a </v>

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>planet that may have life and may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.763
<v Speaker 1>and yet our brain only consumes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>2030 watts of power and yet it </v>

10
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>performance calculations better than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>large supercomputer.</v>

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is the brain wired up?</v>

12
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.243
<v Speaker 1>And if we can figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can we do with it to enhance our </v>

13
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:48.504
<v Speaker 1>mental capabilities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the brain and all the </v>

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:51.834
<v Speaker 1>parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to make any sense at </v>

15
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:54.444
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The visual part of the brain is way in </v>

16
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.413
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the brain constructed the way it </v>

18
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:00.804
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just nothing but an accident of </v>

19
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>one way to look at it is through </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

21
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>That is the back of the brain is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sole call reptilian brain.</v>

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>The most ancient primitive part of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

23
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>their governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced,</v>

24
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>territoriality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mating,</v>

25
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.273
<v Speaker 1>and so they're very back of the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also the kind of brand that you find in </v>

26
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.604
<v Speaker 1>reptiles and when I was a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go to the Science Museum and </v>

27
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.594
<v Speaker 1>look at the snake sometimes and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would stare back at me and I would </v>

28
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they thinking about?</v>

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think no,</v>

30
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I know what they're thinking about was </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this person lunch?</v>

31
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.883
<v Speaker 1>Then we have the center part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain going forward and that's a so </v>

32
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>called monkey brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mammalian brain,</v>

33
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>the brain of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain of social hierarchies.</v>

34
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Then finally the front of the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human brain,</v>

35
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.013
<v Speaker 1>especially the prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where rational thinking is and </v>

36
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>when he asked his self a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I anyway,</v>

37
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>the answer is right behind your </v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead.</v>

38
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>That's where you really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory of consciousness which </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to wrap it all up together.</v>

40
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>There have been about 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so papers written about consciousness</v>

41
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.733
<v Speaker 1>and no consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never in the history of science have so </v>

42
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>many people devoted so much time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

43
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>So little well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a physicist.</v>

44
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>And when we physicists look at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious object,</v>

45
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>the first day we tried to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a model,</v>

46
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.133
<v Speaker 1>a model of this object in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we hit the play button and run </v>

47
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:39.354
<v Speaker 1>it forward in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how Newton was able to come up </v>

48
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>with a theory of gravity.</v>

49
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>This is how Einstein came up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>relativity.</v>

50
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to use this in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human brain and evolution.</v>

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is I have a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of consciousness based on </v>

52
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:56.154
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is consciousness is the number </v>

53
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:01.744
<v Speaker 1>of feedback loops required to create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>model of your position in space with </v>

54
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>relationship to other organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally in relationship to time.</v>

55
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>So think of the consciousness of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thermostat.</v>

56
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I believe that even a lowly thermostat </v>
<v Speaker 1>has one unit of consciousness that is,</v>

57
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>it senses the temperature around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have a flower.</v>

58
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>A flower has maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 units of consciousness.</v>

59
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It has to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>the temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weather,</v>

61
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.504
<v Speaker 1>humidity where gravity is pointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally we go to the reptilian </v>

62
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are called level one.</v>

63
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:41.434
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And reptiles basically have a very good </v>

64
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>understanding of their position in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

65
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>especially cause they have to lunch out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and grab prey.</v>

66
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Then we have level two consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monkey consciousness,</v>

67
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchies.</v>

68
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Where are we in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe?</v>

69
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>And then where are we as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as humans?</v>

70
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>We are in at level three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we run simulations into the future.</v>

71
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Animals apparently don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't plan to hibernate.</v>

72
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.613
<v Speaker 1>They don't plan the next day's agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no conception of tomorrow to </v>

73
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the best of our ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what our brain does.</v>

74
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.123
<v Speaker 1>Our brain is a prediction machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when we look at the evolution </v>

75
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>from the reptilian brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mammalian brain,</v>

76
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:30.814
<v Speaker 1>to the prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realized that it's the process of </v>

77
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>understanding our position and space </v>
<v Speaker 1>with respect to others.</v>

78
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>That is emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

79
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>running simulations into the future.</v>
