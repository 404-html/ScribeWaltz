00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>This video supported by our friends over</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Cheddar.</v>

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared here.</v>

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're living in a galaxy far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far away,</v>

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you've probably heard about the recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>star wars backlash.</v>

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Some fans hated last I so much they </v>
<v Speaker 1>issued an anti Disney manifesto,</v>

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.133
<v Speaker 1>run an actress off instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are crowdfunding for a remake and have </v>

7
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>claimed credit for Solos failure at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>box office.</v>

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>There were even rumors that Kathleen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy v President of Lucas films would</v>

9
00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>retire early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly influenced by twitter.</v>

10
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>This may seem like a bunch of fanboys </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing tantrums or Russian bots.</v>

11
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And while both of those may be partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but think there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>way deeper going on here.</v>

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.443
<v Speaker 1>So join us as we try to use philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to explain the current crisis of the </v>

14
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars Universe and some minor last </v>
<v Speaker 1>jet.</v>

15
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:50.074
<v Speaker 1>I spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also for any of our fans that live in </v>

16
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:52.714
<v Speaker 1>la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be hosting a live </v>

17
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:54.364
<v Speaker 1>Halloween show on October 26 with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie podcast crew and Adam Kovac from </v>

18
00:00:58.601 --> 00:00:59.434
<v Speaker 1>fun house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So check out the invite and the link to </v>

19
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:02.374
<v Speaker 1>tickets in the description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick recap of what people </v>

20
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.064
<v Speaker 1>hate about the new star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's some rather unpleasant </v>

21
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>threads of criticism on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people hate the new star wars for a</v>

22
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:12.604
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That director Ryan Johnson is pretty </v>

23
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>overt about subverting the Canon or as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes to call it,</v>

24
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>killing the past</v>

25
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>raised parents aren't skywalkers or </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] or some other great family,</v>

26
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the constant mystery box teasing</v>

27
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:43.364
<v Speaker 1>in the force awakens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get no storied rise of snuck or </v>

28
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>reveal that he's Mace Windu or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

29
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>just an unceremonious death and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's luke.</v>

30
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.083
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to believe this wholesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero who once saw the light in the </v>

31
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:56.564
<v Speaker 1>darkest of villains is now throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>light sabers off cliffs and almost </v>

32
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>killing his child nephew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just didn't seem right with Disney.</v>

33
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:04.544
<v Speaker 1>Now putting all of their extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe movies on hold and New Star </v>

34
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Wars spinoffs getting universally panned</v>
<v Speaker 1>by fans.</v>

35
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the world of star wars is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in crisis.</v>

36
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.253
<v Speaker 1>What's happening with star wars is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>so different from a problem often faced </v>

37
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:18.854
<v Speaker 1>by social systems or what political </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Juergen Habermas calls a </v>

38
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>legitimation crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

39
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:24.434
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>N existential crisis that threatens the </v>

40
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 1>foundation of a social system.</v>

41
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Social Systems are made of three </v>
<v Speaker 1>subparts,</v>

42
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.180
<v Speaker 1>the governmental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the socio cultural,</v>

43
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and the economic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all interact and in some ways these</v>

44
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>three systems map onto the system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>star wars fandom.</v>

45
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the government side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

46
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>the system needs some kind of story or </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea to give it legitimacy.</v>

47
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Governments do this through different </v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

48
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Monarchies claim their legitimacy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from God.</v>

49
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Democracies through election by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

50
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.250
<v Speaker 1>constitutional governments through well </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutions.</v>

51
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Even dictators claim legitimacy in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>way or another.</v>

52
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Some by they represent the will of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

53
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.193
<v Speaker 1>Other things help to making sure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens are warm and fed or the </v>

54
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.274
<v Speaker 1>economic does wonders to make them ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer questions about how or why your </v>

55
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when this is called into</v>

56
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:14.614
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the people no longer </v>

57
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:17.704
<v Speaker 1>feel a system is upholding its values or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those values are antiquated and </v>

58
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>useless?</v>

59
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.713
<v Speaker 1>What if people feel betrayed when a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation takes over their beloved </v>

60
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>franchise only to birth what some </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider to be an unholy abomination.</v>

61
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>When this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people stop obeying and start rebelling.</v>

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.013
<v Speaker 1>Think about countries whose populations </v>
<v Speaker 1>take to the streets when they suspect </v>

63
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>that their new leaders rig the election </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore aren't legitimate.</v>

64
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>If we use this as a metaphor for star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>

65
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.523
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things start to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucas was basically the divinely </v>

66
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>ordained monarch of the Star Wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>Universe,</v>

67
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>which consisted not just at the six </v>
<v Speaker 1>films he made,</v>

68
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but also a ton of spinoffs in the form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of video games,</v>

69
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>board games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoons and tie in novels.</v>

70
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>They got the royal seal of approval from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucasfilm,</v>

71
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's more like a constitutional</v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy,</v>

72
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but his legitimacy also came from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he,</v>

73
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:07.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>created it all together with Lucas Star </v>

74
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Wars fans helped create a fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning social system with shared </v>

75
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

76
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and agreed upon rules of operation.</v>

77
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what harbor might call the socio </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural side of this system.</v>

78
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Habermas calls this kind of socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohesive system.</v>

79
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Laytonsville a life world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Jed,</v>

80
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I could Laban Svelte with the best of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

81
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>The general meaning of Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the values it represents,</v>

82
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>the characters that is develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories it tells and the themes that</v>

83
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>define it were originally laid out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucas and we're more or less agreed upon</v>

84
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>within the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

85
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe you hate George Jar book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got over it.</v>

86
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Lucas's word was still star wars law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you didn't exactly like it,</v>

87
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>they need a medical rank like all life </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>

88
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.573
<v Speaker 1>This star wars universe also helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a sense of individual identity </v>

89
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>when people use these values and beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make meaning of their lives.</v>

90
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.463
<v Speaker 1>That is until 2012 when Disney bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucas films and she started to get </v>

91
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:04.054
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say there's been a </v>

92
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.094
<v Speaker 1>regime change and suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from the perspective of some </v>

93
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:09.424
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord Lucas was replaced by a money </v>

94
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>hungry animated mouse.</v>

95
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Now do we have a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the governmental equivalent of</v>

96
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Queen Elizabeth relinquishing the throne</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after a nice surprise,</v>

97
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>ending the British monarchy to Mary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berry.</v>

98
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.393
<v Speaker 1>After Disney gained rights to all star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars intellectual property and started </v>

99
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:28.414
<v Speaker 1>making controversial decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found themselves in a big old </v>

100
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:31.954
<v Speaker 1>legitimation crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fan base is going through can </v>

101
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.254
<v Speaker 1>perhaps be best understood by looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest legitimation crises </v>

102
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:39.124
<v Speaker 1>of the last millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that changed the landscape of the </v>

103
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

104
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.804
<v Speaker 1>Disney is facing the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimation crisis the Catholic Church </v>

105
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>did in the 15 hundreds when their </v>
<v Speaker 1>congregations began to rebel.</v>

106
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.513
<v Speaker 1>Up until the 16th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leadership of the Catholic Church </v>

107
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>had total control over the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible.</v>

108
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Since only priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bishops,</v>

109
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.410
<v Speaker 1>the pope and maybe the occasional rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy had access to hard copies.</v>

110
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Bible,</v>

111
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>were so expensive that very few ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to read.</v>

112
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>This famously allowed the church to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with some seriously shady shit like</v>

113
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:11.984
<v Speaker 1>making people pay the church and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of indulgences to get their loved </v>

114
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:15.344
<v Speaker 1>ones out of purgatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all that changed when good old </v>

115
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:18.484
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Gutenberg invented the printing </v>
<v Speaker 1>press in 1440 and enabled the rapid </v>

116
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.114
<v Speaker 1>reproduction of texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly regular people could read the </v>

117
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.324
<v Speaker 1>Bible and what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had slightly different </v>

118
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of some of those crucial</v>
<v Speaker 1>techs.</v>

119
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.543
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crisis of legitimation happened </v>

120
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:33.734
<v Speaker 1>because the masses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer merely consuming </v>

121
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.404
<v Speaker 1>religious meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also helping produce canonical </v>

122
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:39.524
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legitimacy and authority of the </v>

123
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.733
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church was seriously thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>into question by people like Martin </v>

124
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.613
<v Speaker 1>Luther who posted 95 reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church sucked right on their </v>

125
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.484
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This crisis of legitimation and the </v>

126
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>proliferation of different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity really sucked for Europe as</v>

127
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>competing factions really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked murdering each other.</v>

128
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.503
<v Speaker 1>So in this metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is the original star wars </v>

129
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.354
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why did George Lucas get to </v>

130
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>interpret it however he wanted because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote it,</v>

131
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.423
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's not Jesus in this analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's at least an apostle or a </v>

132
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:10.994
<v Speaker 1>prophet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now the authority has moved from a </v>

133
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>single divinely inspired leader to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and fallible organization.</v>

134
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And people question why they wield </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority and developing clause.</v>

135
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I holy texts or it's Canon and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent films,</v>

136
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:24.104
<v Speaker 1>but especially with the last Jedi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed many of the agreed upon </v>

137
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:27.794
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings and truths of the star wars </v>

138
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was just a change of hands from</v>

139
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Lucas to Disney with the administration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of star wars remaining mostly the same,</v>

140
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>people may not have asked questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without the legitimacy of Lucas,</v>

141
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>people started asking more questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney didn't stop there.</v>

142
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.343
<v Speaker 1>They also put the very identity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community when they took a super laser </v>

143
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>to the Canon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the canonizing radio dramas,</v>

144
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>

145
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.204
<v Speaker 1>and hundreds of spinoff novels that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucasfilm previously considered part of </v>

146
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:56.924
<v Speaker 1>the Gospel.</v>

147
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.943
<v Speaker 1>Remember that a life world is important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it defines a community by </v>

148
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>clarifying who's in and out and who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can trust.</v>

149
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.853
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go around hacking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slashing what counts as star wars </v>

150
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.004
<v Speaker 1>because people's identities are wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in this star wars enthusiasts aren't </v>

151
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:11.474
<v Speaker 1>just consumers of this cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've helped make the meaning of the </v>

152
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars universe like the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

153
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Disney now faces the wrath of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated masses,</v>

154
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>except now the problem isn't just that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can read a blog,</v>

155
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make video essays,</v>

156
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:26.024
<v Speaker 1>produced their own cartoons and stream </v>
<v Speaker 1>content to millions of viewers and for </v>

157
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:30.494
<v Speaker 1>every Martin Luther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a million angry youtubers and </v>

158
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>bloggers each posting their own 95 </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with Disney star wars.</v>

159
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.453
<v Speaker 1>We live in an age where people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just consuming media but are also </v>

160
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:41.024
<v Speaker 1>producing it where pro sumo and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>protestantism emerged with a printing </v>

161
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.124
<v Speaker 1>press and literacy took the interpretive</v>
<v Speaker 1>power away from the dude's with the </v>

162
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 1>funny hats.</v>

163
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.563
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the age of the prosumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>empowers people to criticize the few </v>

164
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:54.734
<v Speaker 1>anointed successors of Lucas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now pro-sumer I know it sounds like we </v>

165
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.124
<v Speaker 1>made that word up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually a technical term </v>

166
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.674
<v Speaker 1>coined in the 1980s by Futurists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alvin and Heidi Toffler to describe how </v>

167
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>the role of the producer and consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>merge in the age of modern technology.</v>

168
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Star wars hands are basically prosumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinary.</v>

169
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyday fans have played a huge role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating meaning of star wars by sharing</v>

170
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posting video essays or fan theories.</v>

171
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Subscribing to our slash empire did </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong or re tweeting.</v>

172
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:24.204
<v Speaker 1>Lord palpatine in the age of pro-sumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>ism every theory about where Luke was </v>

173
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>all this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who snuck his,</v>

174
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:30.864
<v Speaker 1>which Jeddah uses which light saber </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting styles is one way of </v>

175
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 1>contributing to the Star Wars universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way for the community to practice</v>

176
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.024
<v Speaker 1>star wars.</v>

177
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.133
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine if you engage in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious tradition in your community </v>

178
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.463
<v Speaker 1>and all of the sudden the recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>appointed Church authority tells you </v>

179
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wafers are alive and while star wars</v>

180
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:50.754
<v Speaker 1>maybe the latest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the only franchise open to </v>

181
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>legitimation crises within their </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

182
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.823
<v Speaker 1>Pro symbolism is beginning to affect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations between fans and producers </v>

183
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 1>even scaring away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Mangold,</v>

184
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.734
<v Speaker 1>director of Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who recently tweeted at the point when </v>

185
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:04.554
<v Speaker 1>work writing and directing big </v>
<v Speaker 1>franchises has become the emotionally </v>

186
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:07.944
<v Speaker 1>loaded equivalent of writing a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter of the Bible with the probable </v>

187
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>danger of being stoned and called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blast femur.</v>

188
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Then a lot of bolter minds are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave these films to hacks and corporate</v>

189
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:17.964
<v Speaker 1>boards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the star wars system about to </v>

190
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>collapse under the weight of its crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>

191
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.693
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic Church obviously didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumble under there legitimation hiccup </v>

192
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 1>and maybe star wars won't either because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is systems learn.</v>

193
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>After a few Vatican council's and papel </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

194
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.253
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic Church managed to revise </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the violent theology and really </v>

195
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.720
<v Speaker 1>solidified the community under common </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and shared beliefs.</v>

196
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Sure there were Protestants who totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieced out and started their own thing.</v>

197
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.250
<v Speaker 1>But in general the system learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusted and stayed intact.</v>

198
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.323
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which direction will the star wars </v>

199
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>system take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll Disney find a way to evolve in the</v>

200
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:53.664
<v Speaker 1>time of prosumer ism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting their fans and the universe </v>

201
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>they've helped create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will fans choose to grow with the system</v>

202
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.220
<v Speaker 1>and find new ways of interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their beloved material?</v>

203
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Or will there be a reckoning where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney in the fans part,</v>

204
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.264
<v Speaker 1>ways like the Catholics and Protestants </v>
<v Speaker 1>each starting their own version of the </v>

205
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:11.460
<v Speaker 1>religion and competing for the souls of </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you guys think.</v>
