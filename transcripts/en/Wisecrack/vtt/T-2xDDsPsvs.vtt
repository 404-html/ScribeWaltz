<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by Blue Apron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first hundred wisecrack fans to sign</v>

2
00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:04.174
<v Speaker 1>up for blue apron at the link in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description will get $50 off the first </v>

3
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick around for some Tacos.</v>

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.141
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it cracked?</v>

5
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:13.974
<v Speaker 1>Jared again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a franchise so surrounded than </v>

6
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems fitting that nobody had a clue.</v>

7
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>The cloverfield paradox had even been </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.773
<v Speaker 1>let alone that it was being released </v>
<v Speaker 1>within hours of its announcement during </v>

9
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:24.924
<v Speaker 1>the super bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are plenty of reasons why the </v>

10
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>cloverfield paradox should have worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and plenty of reasons why it didn't,</v>

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.523
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to focus on the element </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes to largely unrelated scripts </v>

12
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:35.244
<v Speaker 1>so unique and cohesive and makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third one such an epic fail that </v>

13
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our relationship to reality and trauma.</v>

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack addition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloverfield paradox,</v>

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.313
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong and spoilers ahead for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the cloverfield movies before we </v>

16
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:50.604
<v Speaker 1>dip into that secret sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recap of the cloverfield paradoxes in </v>

17
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The year is 20 slash 28 and the world is</v>

18
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.424
<v Speaker 1>in the midst of an energy crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Crew aboard cloverfield station are </v>

19
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>orbiting Earth to test the experimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd particle accelerator,</v>

20
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>which they hope will save the world by </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing safe,</v>

21
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>clean energy just before they turn on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the machine.</v>

22
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:09.894
<v Speaker 1>Though we overhear an interview with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer who thinks that turning on the </v>

23
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.224
<v Speaker 1>particle accelerator will open a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wormhole to other dimensions and </v>

24
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows what,</v>

25
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>onto an unsuspecting population</v>

26
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 2>the likes of which we have never seen</v>

27
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>and surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what happens there,</v>

28
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.073
<v Speaker 1>teleported into another dimension across</v>
<v Speaker 1>space where they experienced the </v>

29
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>combined horrors of Phantom limbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy crawlers,</v>

30
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>and faulty wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crew must figure out how to get home</v>

31
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.054
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably figure out where it </v>

32
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:40.644
<v Speaker 1>goes from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's one thing we should be </v>

33
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>excited about getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloverfield paradox,</v>

34
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.323
<v Speaker 1>it's answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the giant monster that attack </v>

35
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>New York at the end of the first one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it survive the nuke?</v>

36
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>If we hope to get those answers in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloverfield lane,</v>

37
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.963
<v Speaker 1>well we're out of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead we get Walter Sobchak reminding </v>

38
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>us that this isn't nom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are rules.</v>

39
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

40
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got a little excited.</v>

41
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping that point</v>

42
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>and as our protagonist escapes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>clutches,</v>

43
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>she enters a world of pain and aliens </v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

44
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>but the cloverfield paradox does give us</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers those giant monsters.</v>

45
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>It's from another dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camcorder video.</v>

46
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It might not even be from the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline,</v>

47
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>so why isn't getting these answers more </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarding.</v>

48
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Cloverfield and 10 cloverfield lane are </v>
<v Speaker 1>both films about trauma,</v>

49
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.823
<v Speaker 1>both the trauma one might associate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>war or natural disaster or extra </v>

50
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.684
<v Speaker 1>dimensional aliens destroying your home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the trauma of being physically </v>

51
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>trapped in a relationship with a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to go full Jack Torrance at</v>

52
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:40.194
<v Speaker 1>any minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ears johnny 10 cloverfield lane brings </v>

53
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>up all the same aspects of abusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

54
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Possible gas lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nowhere to go,</v>

55
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Michelle and threats of violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>interspersed with normal family fund,</v>

56
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>but the first two movies aren't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about dealing with trauma.</v>

57
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>They are about the impossibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully comprehending that trauma.</v>

58
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>These insanely violent encounters with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of closure.</v>

59
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Speak to one of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties of navigating the world for</v>

60
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>philosopher and sometimes Klepto Maniac </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Lacan.</v>

61
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.443
<v Speaker 1>There exists a fundamental human </v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to fully grasp what he calls </v>

62
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>the real or the world as it truly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were field throws us in the midst of</v>

63
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>an alien invasion that evades easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>

64
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>We're often given the byproduct of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening or people's reactions,</v>

65
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.253
<v Speaker 1>but almost never get the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>turmoil and unexplainable way like when </v>

66
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.424
<v Speaker 1>the head of the Statue of Liberty comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling down the street or a </v>

67
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>horrifically disfigured woman is begging</v>
<v Speaker 1>for help.</v>

68
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.323
<v Speaker 1>First cloverfield the reality of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening only sparsely comes in new </v>

69
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:42.474
<v Speaker 1>segments in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways cloverfield achieves </v>

70
00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:45.554
<v Speaker 1>this is with perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's filmed pov style shot by the </v>

71
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:49.394
<v Speaker 1>characters in the movie and begins with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a detailed look at our main cast of </v>

72
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:52.844
<v Speaker 1>characters during a party for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist rob in the middle of the </v>

73
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:56.384
<v Speaker 1>Shin Dig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're interrupted by an explosion </v>

74
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.800
<v Speaker 1>signaling the monster invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their battle for survival.</v>

75
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Cinder cut with older video that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being recorded over,</v>

76
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 1>which gives you glimpses into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between rob and Beth.</v>

77
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.023
<v Speaker 1>This subjective point of view means we </v>
<v Speaker 1>only ever get hints of where and what </v>

78
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:11.984
<v Speaker 1>the monster is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the military are responding to it </v>

79
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.920
<v Speaker 1>and even what it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:18.710
<v Speaker 1>just like you would in real life by </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting it this way.</v>

81
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.080
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what kind of monster they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are facing,</v>

82
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>but we do know who the characters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they're facing personally.</v>

83
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 1>10 cloverfield lane employs a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

84
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.053
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't use the same Pov south who </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut us off from the reality of what's </v>

85
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:32.624
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather uses a concrete bunker to </v>

86
00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:35.444
<v Speaker 1>similar ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The protagonist Michelle wakes up in a </v>

87
00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:38.144
<v Speaker 1>bunker that she can't leave for reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seemed suspicious to say the least </v>

88
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 1>she's told she was rescued.</v>

89
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Give it us how I saved your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's acceptable</v>

90
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and that the outside world is deadly</v>

91
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.910
<v Speaker 3>outside of here.</v>

92
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.423
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we suspect that Howard is preparing </v>

93
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:53.704
<v Speaker 1>to where Michelle skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get just enough interaction from the </v>

94
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>outside world to give credence to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

95
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>but not enough to truly know what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

96
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>As the movie ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get enough information to let us know</v>

97
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>that things aren't going great for </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

98
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:07.654
<v Speaker 1>but not much else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The control of information in both </v>

99
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>movies is what makes them so tense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>

100
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.180
<v Speaker 1>We have to fill in the gap which instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being frustrating makes with the sort</v>

101
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>of thing that spawns endless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fan theories for Lacan that reality,</v>

102
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:22.294
<v Speaker 1>which seems to evade us the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is disconnected from our own personal </v>

103
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:26.464
<v Speaker 1>experience only through language or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls the symbolic can we bridge the </v>

104
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>gap between our minds and the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond them.</v>

105
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>What cloverfield explorers is the chasm </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the real and language,</v>

106
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>the inability to bridge that gap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters and us.</v>

107
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>The audience want answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to understand what is happening,</v>

108
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>but the film withholds the language to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

109
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.813
<v Speaker 1>That chasm for Lacan is called Lac and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what drives the tension of the </v>

110
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:53.284
<v Speaker 1>first two movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know what it's like to be at a </v>

111
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>loss for words during a terrible event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Footage of nine slash 11 shows onlookers</v>

112
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.193
<v Speaker 1>covering their mouths in silent horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>while watching the tragic events happen </v>

113
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.124
<v Speaker 1>in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no secret that these cinema verite </v>

114
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.154
<v Speaker 1>found footage style of the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloverfield was inspired by the events </v>

115
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.054
<v Speaker 1>and coverage of nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of cultural trauma runs deep </v>

116
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and was still a raw nerve at the time of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trailers release.</v>

117
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Mass entertainment wasn't willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>return to these sorts of disaster movies</v>

118
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:21.914
<v Speaker 1>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the movie is able to tap into that </v>

119
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:24.494
<v Speaker 1>post nine slash 11 anxiety by borrowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the structure of hygiene movies </v>

120
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>there by using a symbol to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shared trauma.</v>

121
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.963
<v Speaker 1>This is what makes it so cathartic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 cloverfield lane released some eight </v>

122
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:36.164
<v Speaker 1>years later at a time of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty and change was a paranoid </v>

123
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:39.884
<v Speaker 1>thriller that makes you question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people around you against this gap </v>

124
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:43.664
<v Speaker 1>between language and reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cloverfield paradox gives us its </v>

125
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>antithesis sites.</v>

126
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 2>This is the paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

127
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 2>particles interacting with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>across two dimensions.</v>

128
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sit down to have distinct </v>

129
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 2>realities in a multiverse.</v>

130
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.990
<v Speaker 1>While there are certainly unexplained </v>
<v Speaker 1>events like why the hell did Mondays arm</v>

131
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:02.824
<v Speaker 1>keep moving after it was detached?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole premise of the movie trans </v>

132
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>dimensional travel explains the origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cloverfield event in the first 15</v>

133
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 1>minutes of the movie</v>

134
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.010
<v Speaker 2>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demons East to clarify,</v>

135
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.233
<v Speaker 2>you believe their efforts to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy crisis might unleash demons and </v>

136
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:24.280
<v Speaker 2>not just hearing that in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future,</v>

137
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.960
<v Speaker 2>in other dimensions,</v>

138
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.123
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying mysteries can't be </v>

139
00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:29.094
<v Speaker 1>solved or that science can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't be as background noise </v>

140
00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:35.070
<v Speaker 1>in the first half of the movie turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrifying,</v>

141
00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:35.904
<v Speaker 1>ineffable monstrosities that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>invaded earth for reasons beyond our </v>

142
00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:42.630
<v Speaker 1>imagining happened because sites little </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointing isn't it,</v>

143
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.270
<v Speaker 1>and if you're going to give an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation or revelation,</v>

144
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good examples tend to give us a paradigm</v>

145
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 1>shift or clarify motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In exceptional cases,</v>

146
00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:55.020
<v Speaker 1>they can give you an entirely new way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>view the events prior,</v>

147
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 1>like when you find out the truth about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyler durden or the men in black.</v>

148
00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.363
<v Speaker 1>How does quantum entanglement add to or </v>
<v Speaker 1>reframe the original cloverfield </v>

149
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:03.870
<v Speaker 1>stories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

150
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.033
<v Speaker 1>and besides breaking away from the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trauma that defined the first two </v>

151
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:08.454
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no central fear or shared </v>

152
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 1>trauma for the audience to latch onto.</v>

153
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.250
<v Speaker 1>If cloverfield was the fear of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion and 10 cloverfield lane was the</v>

154
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Speaker 1>fear of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the central fear of this movie?</v>

155
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Fear of particle accelerators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peak oil by explaining way,</v>

156
00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:25.134
<v Speaker 1>the mystery almost as an afterthought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Rub the audience not just of their </v>

157
00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 1>mystery but there catharsis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While yes,</v>

158
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:35.040
<v Speaker 1>explaining a mystery ruins the fun is </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an obvious point.</v>

159
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.023
<v Speaker 1>It's what creates our desires for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery that is important to the </v>

160
00:08:38.461 --> 00:08:41.850
<v Speaker 1>cloverfield movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MILIKAN's idea of lack gets to the heart</v>

161
00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:42.684
<v Speaker 1>of understanding why we love a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery and why jj Abrams property </v>

162
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:49.560
<v Speaker 1>seemed to have such a hard time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolving those mysteries.</v>

163
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.573
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at you last just to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality around us always evades easy </v>

164
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>answers and the to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want everything explained,</v>

165
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>not just because we all like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory,</v>

166
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.123
<v Speaker 1>but because of the catharsis that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these shared experience of </v>

167
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>realizing that some things can't end </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes shouldn't be put into words.</v>

168
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>The first to cloverfield movies knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and played on that,</v>

169
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>which is what made them so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately rewarding.</v>

170
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.753
<v Speaker 1>The cloverfield paradox paradoxically </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruins the fun by giving us all the </v>

171
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>answers and pretty half baked ones at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

172
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.513
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think wisecrack can the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie have more tastefully explain the </v>

173
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.264
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you think in the </v>

174
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

177
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:42.350
