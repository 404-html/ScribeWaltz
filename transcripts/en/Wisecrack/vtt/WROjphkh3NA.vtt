<v Speaker 1>villains.</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best part of a movie can't live with</v>

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.524
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't feed them to a pack of rabid </v>

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.384
<v Speaker 1>hyenas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually villains are the people we love </v>

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>to hate or fear with the occasional </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor.</v>

6
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:18.144
<v Speaker 1>Come have empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something has been happening with </v>

7
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.634
<v Speaker 1>villains lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you found yourself nodding along to </v>

8
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.514
<v Speaker 1>the logic of a diabolical plot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling more empathetic than usual </v>

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>towards a film's antagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not alone.</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.113
<v Speaker 1>Today's villains from killmonger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Panther to screen slaver and </v>

11
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>incredible to have become weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatable,</v>

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>each equipped with their own cogent </v>
<v Speaker 1>critiques of the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.133
<v Speaker 1>Villainy is and always has been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the value systems and </v>

15
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:47.724
<v Speaker 1>fears of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did we get from this to this and </v>

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>what does it say about our past and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>world today,</v>

17

<v Speaker 1>or we're gonna find out in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack addition on the cinematic </v>

18
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>history of villainy and warning.</v>

19
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of spoilers here for </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>both old and new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>want to give a quick shout out to our </v>

<v Speaker 1>look like Comic Sans and Papayas had a </v>

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>or by clicking the link in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description and now onto the villainy.</v>

33
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.863
<v Speaker 1>To understand how we got here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to explore multiple arrows and </v>

34
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>see how film villains embody the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxieties of the times.</v>

35
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick disclaimer,</v>

36
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>none of these trends are absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains,</v>

37
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>can break the mold or jump back into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past for inspiration,</v>

38
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but what we're discussing here are </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticeable trends among some of the most</v>

39
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.893
<v Speaker 1>enduring films of each era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start our journey from </v>

40
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>these simple mustache twirling villain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the complex philosophizing radical by</v>

41
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>looking at the 19 fifties and early 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

42
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.483
<v Speaker 1>the height of the war that wasn't hot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the post World War party in the suburbs </v>

43
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>era of American history describing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>world seemed pretty simple.</v>

44
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>We were the heroes who saved the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the evil Nazis,</v>

45
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>and we're now tasked with staving off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the also evil Ussr.</v>

46
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It was very black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so where are villains?</v>

47
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.693
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also metaphorically movie screens </v>

49
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>were full of bad Russian people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad Asian people,</v>

50
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.394
<v Speaker 1>and very bad aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do all these naughty dudes have in </v>

51
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the other inherent,</v>

52
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.143
<v Speaker 1>inexplicably evil that stoked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying America and our apple pie </v>

53
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:48.984
<v Speaker 1>values sometimes that other took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of an amorphous read for Kami blob </v>

54
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.783
<v Speaker 1>or the creature from the black lagoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other times the other was an alien </v>

55
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:57.774
<v Speaker 1>hatched in a pod and designed to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly like you as in the invasion of </v>

56
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.684
<v Speaker 1>the body snatchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which some critics say represented the </v>

57
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>fear of communist brainwashing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>infiltration,</v>

58
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 2>and you're reborn into an untroubled </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what a world.</v>

59
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.053
<v Speaker 1>Also in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie industry went way back to </v>

60
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.054
<v Speaker 1>basics British thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of biblical Sagas with running </v>

61
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:25.951
<v Speaker 1>times of four hours or more of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive epics proved massively popular</v>

62
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>with three ranking in the top 10 highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>grossing films of the decade.</v>

63
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.143
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps this was partially because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>so perfectly embodied cold war </v>

64
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.744
<v Speaker 1>propaganda which depicted a face off </v>
<v Speaker 1>between God fearing Americans and the </v>

65
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>godless communist Ben Hur showed an </v>
<v Speaker 1>aristocratic Jews being persecuted by an</v>

66
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Evil Roman commander while quo Vadis </v>
<v Speaker 1>pits.</v>

67
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>New Christian converts against the Evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Emperor Nero and his Roman Empire.</v>

68
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>A world is mine and mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the 10 commandments depicts good old</v>

69
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Moses staring down the Egyptian Emperor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramses.</v>

70
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>These films all portrayed the Noble </v>
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian taking on a cruel,</v>

71
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate of a non monotheistic </v>

72
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.364
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These villains were representative of </v>

73
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>larger groups of bad people who want it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cancel baseball.</v>

74
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Tupperware parties,</v>

75
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 3>rain is not only been washed as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

76
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.000
<v Speaker 3>just being dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

77
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.940
<v Speaker 1>even when villains weren't explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign or pagan.</v>

78
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.833
<v Speaker 1>They were just anti American communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double agents as seen in a flurry of </v>

79
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:27.794
<v Speaker 1>cold war propaganda films later spy </v>
<v Speaker 1>mania of the 19 sixties would also </v>

80
00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:32.144
<v Speaker 1>reflect cold war anxiety with James Bond</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing off against various agents have </v>

81
00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:36.404
<v Speaker 1>smashed the imaginary Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence agency not to remain that </v>

82
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.643
<v Speaker 1>much longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What all these movies had in common was </v>

83
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:45.854
<v Speaker 1>an US versus them mentality with no good</v>
<v Speaker 1>commies portrayed as pure and simply </v>

84
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.313
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One dimensional foreign slash communist </v>

85
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:54.224
<v Speaker 1>slash alien slash blog villains took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>backseat in the late sixties and </v>

86
00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>seventies as we saw a definitive shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the portrayal of villains.</v>

87
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It was fitting for a time of major </v>
<v Speaker 1>social turbulence and soul searching.</v>

88
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>As the civil rights movement and Vietnam</v>
<v Speaker 1>made visible,</v>

89
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>some of the not so perfect aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America like racism and war,</v>

90
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.010
<v Speaker 1>this period also saw a startling drop in</v>
<v Speaker 1>public trust of government,</v>

91
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.840
<v Speaker 1>a phenomenon that changed movie villains</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically as outrage over the war met</v>

92
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>outrage about Nixon's tapes.</v>

93
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Notably 19 seventies movies shined a </v>
<v Speaker 1>light on the corrupt social systems that</v>

94
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Americans were increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned with.</v>

95
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Evil politicians and public officials </v>
<v Speaker 1>loomed large popular political thriller.</v>

96
00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:35.204
<v Speaker 1>All the president's men brought the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Watergate scandal to the big screen in </v>

97
00:05:37.761 --> 00:05:38.594
<v Speaker 1>1976.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fictional accounts also touched on </v>

98
00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:44.330
<v Speaker 1>institutional corruption like in Steven </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg's jaws,</v>

99
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.283
<v Speaker 1>which depicts a crooked mayor who cares </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about tourism revenue then keeping </v>

100
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>people from becoming shark bait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Christ's sake,</v>

101
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Kumar's the fourth of July at we will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>open for business.</v>

102
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be one of the best summers</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've ever had.</v>

103
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.253
<v Speaker 1>Further depictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil in mighty came in Chinatown in </v>

104
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:00.674
<v Speaker 1>which these sinister billionaire rejects</v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences judgments of him by claiming </v>

105
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>that his evil acts were brought about by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his environment.</v>

106
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>People never have to face the fact the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right time,</v>

107
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.130
<v Speaker 2>the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're capable of anything.</v>

108
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.083
<v Speaker 1>The suggestion is that circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 1>have power make the villain rather than </v>

109
00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:19.254
<v Speaker 1>any innate nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt cop films where another popular </v>

110
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:22.824
<v Speaker 1>way of portraying the power struggles </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place serpico based on a true </v>

111
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:26.904
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depicts a world in which police </v>

112
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:30.090
<v Speaker 1>corruption is an assumed fact.</v>

113
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.550
<v Speaker 4>You're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fine without a warning,</v>

114
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.040
<v Speaker 4>right in your head.</v>

115
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.023
<v Speaker 1>In this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bribes and brutality are the coffee and </v>

116
00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:41.820
<v Speaker 1>donuts of police work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much so that Alba,</v>

117
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.653
<v Speaker 1>Chino Serpico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is distrusted because he's not willing </v>

118
00:06:44.161 --> 00:06:45.900
<v Speaker 1>to accept bribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's face it,</v>

119
00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:47.400
<v Speaker 1>who can dress the cabin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't take money.</v>

120
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt cops were mainstays on the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen popping up in the Godfather,</v>

121
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.343
<v Speaker 1>white lightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French connection and the </v>

122
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:54.294
<v Speaker 1>conversation to name a few institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems had lost their presumption of </v>

123
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>goodwill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as a result,</v>

124
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>we started seeing villains who embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very broken systems.</v>

125
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:03.744
<v Speaker 1>People were angry about take nurse </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratchet from one flew over the cuckoo's </v>

126
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:07.254
<v Speaker 1>nest who turned a benevolent profession </v>
<v Speaker 1>into one that turns a vivid individuals </v>

127
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.860
<v Speaker 1>into drugged up dependent ghosts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

128
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.803
<v Speaker 4>You're no crazier in the average ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>flat walking around on the streets and </v>

129
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.190
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

130
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.010
<v Speaker 1>In a similarly bleak depiction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutionalization.</v>

131
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Escape from Alcatraz renders prisoners </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic heroes struggling against </v>

132
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:25.954
<v Speaker 1>the efforts of an evil warden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something very similar can be seen in </v>

133
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>cool hand luke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all these cases,</v>

134
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 1>the person tasked with imposing law and </v>
<v Speaker 1>order or societal norms is recast as the</v>

135
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:37.804
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 19 seventies further muddied the </v>

136
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:40.354
<v Speaker 1>waters by blurring the line between hero</v>
<v Speaker 1>and villain and told the distinctions </v>

137
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:44.284
<v Speaker 1>became all but meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These characters are depicted as </v>

138
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:47.494
<v Speaker 1>conflicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily flawed protagonists with </v>

139
00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 1>questionable even hideous morals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Scorsese's.</v>

140
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 76 film taxi driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis bickle is one such heroic villain</v>

141
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 1>or villain is hero depending on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

142
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.353
<v Speaker 1>He swings on the pendulum of violently </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad to violently good ish as it goes </v>

143
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:07.810
<v Speaker 1>from plotting to gun down a presidential</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>

144
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 1>the plotting to rescue a 12 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute in the previous years.</v>

145
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Dog Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon,</v>

146
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.000
<v Speaker 1>novice crook and hero slash villain </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunny Warcek botches,</v>

147
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:19.540
<v Speaker 1>a bank robbery and spontaneously takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the workers hostage.</v>

148
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.523
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we soon learned the reason for sunny's </v>

149
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 1>dalliance with crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed the money to help his wife,</v>

150
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Leon get sexual reassignment surgery </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

151
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Sonny wanted to get me money for the sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>change operation,</v>

152
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:33.670
<v Speaker 1>but when is he going to get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find out that sunny is a quality dude</v>

153
00:08:33.671 --> 00:08:37.510
<v Speaker 1>who pays his parents rent and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically go around holding up banks,</v>

154
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.480
<v Speaker 1>not your villain of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

155
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:41.314
<v Speaker 1>one particularly popular series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star wars stands out as markedly </v>

156
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:47.170
<v Speaker 1>simplistic in this era of more complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains.</v>

157
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.213
<v Speaker 1>It might seem to counter our theory as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it presents a pretty basic black and </v>

158
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:52.234
<v Speaker 1>white paradigm of good versus evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it goes against the grain later </v>

159
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 1>on with he walks reminiscent of the Viet</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cong.</v>

160
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.023
<v Speaker 1>The 19 eighties backpedaled hard on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti villain by reveling in more </v>

161
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.164
<v Speaker 1>cartoonish villains who directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied the biggest threats of time </v>

162
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.393
<v Speaker 1>effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ushered back in an US versus them </v>

163
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>paradigm by tapping into the fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding the war on drugs.</v>

164
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.873
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the villains of the time wanted a piece </v>

165
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:17.364
<v Speaker 1>of that sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet drug money in films like scarface </v>

166
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 1>to live and die in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beverly Hills cop and raw deal,</v>

167
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.683
<v Speaker 1>this depiction of evil drug lords could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be seen as a Yin Yang response to the </v>

168
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>less than savory cops of the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Films Take Tango and cash,</v>

169
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:33.084
<v Speaker 1>which depicted to roguish cops who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated as irrepressible protagonists </v>

170
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>despite engaging in some of the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>same violence,</v>

171
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:40.764
<v Speaker 1>serpico condemned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however they're portrayed as the best </v>

172
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>cops in the city because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconventional.</v>

173
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:46.014
<v Speaker 1>Tactics have costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local drug lord and rat kissing villain </v>

174
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Eve's Perrey oodles of money then said </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingpin,</v>

175
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.823
<v Speaker 1>as if schooled in the bad cup films of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies gets them falsely </v>

176
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:56.454
<v Speaker 1>incriminated for murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film ultimately comes down hard on </v>

177
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>the side of cops and a by any means </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary model of policing.</v>

178
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.293
<v Speaker 1>I've been a policeman for 12 years and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's the best organization in the </v>

179
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

180
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.113
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decade saw the resurgence of cold </v>

181
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:11.574
<v Speaker 1>war anxieties as president Ronald Reagan</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased military spending and ended </v>

182
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:15.414
<v Speaker 1>arms control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans rediscovered their fear of </v>

183
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 1>nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

184
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 1>evil Russians had their moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun with films like rocky,</v>

185
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>for which remain the highest grossing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports flick until 2009.</v>

186
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.443
<v Speaker 1>It's also been accused of being pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti Soviet propaganda because of its </v>

187
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>villain Soviet boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan Drago,</v>

188
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.550
<v Speaker 1>who was decidedly not a charmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film red heat,</v>

189
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.553
<v Speaker 1>really one the villain jackpot in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>depiction of Soviet drug lord Victor </v>

190
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.523
<v Speaker 1>Rostow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who in a Trifecta of evil also murdered </v>

191
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:45.564
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but arguably the clearest example of 19 </v>

192
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>of these cold war villains came with </v>
<v Speaker 1>1984 is red dawn,</v>

193
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>which imagine Soviet forces invading </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and worse,</v>

194
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 1>taking photos in our national parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film's director,</v>

195
00:10:57.331 --> 00:10:58.164
<v Speaker 1>John Milius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly saw the film as a warning to </v>

196
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.014
<v Speaker 1>Americans to take seriously the threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet invasion by a Central </v>

197
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.030
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

198
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And if this seems like a scaremonger for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

199
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.733
<v Speaker 1>consider that Melius was the direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration for this guy multimode </v>

200
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.743
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're entering a world of pain despite </v>

201
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:15.534
<v Speaker 1>some return to the other as the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are hints of the seventies </v>

202
00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:19.694
<v Speaker 1>skepticism towards institutions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties when villains are not pure </v>

203
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>character traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From an Ansi Reagan fever dream,</v>

204
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>we see them continue exploiting corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions for personal gain.</v>

205
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Gordon greed is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gecko,</v>

206
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:33.384
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the corrupt financial industry to </v>

207
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 1>fulfill his own gold plated desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

208
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 1>diehards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hans Gruber,</v>

209
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>emerges as one for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most enduring villains,</v>

210
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.133
<v Speaker 1>when he and his cronies sees a high rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>building and take hostages during a </v>

211
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:47.034
<v Speaker 1>Christmas party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operates under the guise of being a </v>

212
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:49.614
<v Speaker 1>terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exacting revenge on an Evil Corporation </v>

213
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Naca trauma corporations legacy</v>

214
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 5>agreed around the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are about to be taught a lesson in </v>

215
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.350
<v Speaker 5>the real useful,</v>

216
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>but interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his moral high ground crumbled when it's</v>

217
00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:06.780
<v Speaker 1>revealed that just like Gordon Gekko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really only after cold hard cash.</v>

218
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 1>This is all about the robbery.</v>

219
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.793
<v Speaker 5>The whole building odds are under $600.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just disappear when you still </v>

220
00:12:20.041 --> 00:12:24.210
<v Speaker 5>$600 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They will find you unless you're already</v>

221
00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>

222
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>In the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American cinema swapped out the reds for</v>

223
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:28.324
<v Speaker 1>homegrown terrorists to fit a decade in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which domestic terrorism and going </v>

224
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>postal dominated headlines Fittingly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

225
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>It was an era of disgruntled Middleclass</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes and bombers next door,</v>

226
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>a prime time for complex anti villains </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are fighting small localized battles</v>

227
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 1>by radical means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the villain from speed.</v>

228
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:47.074
<v Speaker 1>Howard Payne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this former bomb squad officer turned </v>

229
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 1>extortionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned psychopathic.</v>

230
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Terrorists is partially motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>that suite.</v>

231
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:54.484
<v Speaker 1>Three point $7,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also expresses a sense of </v>

232
00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>superiority.</v>

233
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 2>You still don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

234
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bomb was made to explode.</v>

235
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 2>That's its meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its purpose.</v>

236
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 1>That's bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hint of philosophy,</v>

237
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>a motivation beyond cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard cash.</v>

238
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Howard's more complicated than say </v>
<v Speaker 1>gruber,</v>

239
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 1>in that he genuinely desires meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

240
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>It just goes about getting them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst way possible.</v>

241
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.823
<v Speaker 1>Same goes for Kevin Spacey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supremely sadistic John Doe in the 1995 </v>

242
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:28.204
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven who sees himself as a chosen </v>

243
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Speaker 1>warrior in the crusade against everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since</v>

244
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.460
<v Speaker 6>we see a deadly sin on every street </v>
<v Speaker 6>corner in every home and we tolerate it,</v>

245
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.710
<v Speaker 6>we tolerate it because it's common </v>
<v Speaker 6>sense.</v>

246
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 6>It's trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We tolerate it.</v>

247
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.561
<v Speaker 6>Morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>noon,</v>

248
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:44.550
<v Speaker 6>and night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

249
00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:49.551
<v Speaker 6>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm setting the example.</v>

250
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.703
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arlington Road became the pinnacle of </v>

251
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>the domestic terrorists genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's villain mans the girl at the block</v>

252
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 1>party as he carries out plans for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>militant groups,</v>

253
00:13:58.751 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>latest deadly bombing.</v>

254
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's millions of waiting to take up </v>

255
00:14:03.811 --> 00:14:06.510
<v Speaker 2>arms ready to spread the word.</v>

256
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.330
<v Speaker 1>He claims to be pursuing a lofty noble </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

257
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.343
<v Speaker 1>but within his critique of government is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also an indictment of the supposed </v>

258
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.570
<v Speaker 1>niceties of Clinton era prosperity.</v>

259
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy in your godless</v>

260
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.383
<v Speaker 1>trouble in suburbia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also bounded in American beauty which </v>

261
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:25.730
<v Speaker 1>depicted the enemy as lester's neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 1>be homophobic.</v>

262
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:26.564
<v Speaker 1>Nazi memorabilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoarding Frank Fits who kills Lester </v>

263
00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:31.490
<v Speaker 1>after he rebuffs his romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancements.</v>

264
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:32.683
<v Speaker 1>In both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the villains feel victimized by the </v>

265
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:38.930
<v Speaker 1>system or circumstance and seek justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own terms.</v>

266
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.093
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes these villains have genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 1>noble causes as they rail against the </v>

267
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>systems that have long take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 95.</v>

268
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.800
<v Speaker 1>The Rock in which Ed Harris has general </v>
<v Speaker 1>humble,</v>

269
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.783
<v Speaker 1>a disgraced USFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SMC Brigadier General threatens a nerve </v>

270
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.084
<v Speaker 1>gas attack on San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 vx gas rockets into the hardest San </v>

271
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.463
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got 17 hours to deliver the </v>

272
00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.024
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding that the families have slain </v>

273
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:01.244
<v Speaker 1>marines be compensated for their deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we come to an interesting question </v>

274
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 1>of whether noble ends justified by what </v>
<v Speaker 1>means in this way,</v>

275
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:09.044
<v Speaker 1>the film acts as a prelude to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions being explored by current day </v>

276
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 1>villains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though usually on a much wider scale,</v>

277
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.343
<v Speaker 1>movies couldn't not be changed by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>event as pivotal as nine slash 11 and </v>

278
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:19.454
<v Speaker 1>the subsequent war on terror with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two thousands came a new shift in movie </v>

279
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:23.294
<v Speaker 1>villains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as America confronted an existential </v>

280
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>threat to its sense of safety and power </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

281
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.663
<v Speaker 1>Fittingly the first two installments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy </v>

282
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 1>captured the Popular Imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this decade.</v>

283
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:34.543
<v Speaker 1>In 2005 Batman begins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the dangerous metropolis under </v>

284
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.354
<v Speaker 1>attack by an international terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 1>group called the League of shadows and </v>

285
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>its leader rouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

286
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who in remarkably on the nose metaphor,</v>

287
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>wants to blow up Gotham's tallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyscraper.</v>

288
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Arguably the decades most salient </v>
<v Speaker 1>villain came,</v>

289
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.223
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the </v>

290
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:53.834
<v Speaker 1>joker in the dark knight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joker manifests as the spirit of </v>

291
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of anarchy and chaos of a</v>

292
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>particularly destructive and nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

293
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:04.610
<v Speaker 1>As critic Douglas Kellner writes in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

294
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:05.444
<v Speaker 1>Cinema Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only sensible way to live in this </v>

295
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:07.634
<v Speaker 1>world is without rules in case the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison between the joker and real </v>

296
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 1>world terrorism wasn't clear enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calendar notes that the film is bursting</v>

297
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:15.044
<v Speaker 1>with nine slash 11 iconography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan's film also gave us one of two </v>

298
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>coin flipping evildoers with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character of Harvey Dent alias to face,</v>

299
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.473
<v Speaker 1>a representation of how a confrontation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the joker's evils can corrupt even </v>

300
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 1>the noblest person to face goes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding people's fates,</v>

301
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.583
<v Speaker 1>do a plunge into a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless existence of pure </v>

302
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:35.060
<v Speaker 1>contingency and nihilism.</v>

303
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Coen brothers,</v>

304
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.633
<v Speaker 1>Anton sugar from no country for old men </v>
<v Speaker 1>also uses a coin to decide the fate of </v>

305
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:41.954
<v Speaker 1>his victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't kill out of greed self or </v>

306
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.163
<v Speaker 1>some kind of practical goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leading one character to comment is a </v>

307
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:48.674
<v Speaker 1>peculiar man might even say he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles transcend money or drugs or </v>

308
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

309
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.134
<v Speaker 1>sugar is quite simply an active </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilists who believes that if all </v>

310
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:00.974
<v Speaker 1>morality is contrived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coin flip is as good a way as any to </v>

311
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:04.634
<v Speaker 1>decide who lives and dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't need a coin to affirm the </v>

312
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>random or meaningless nature of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives are deaths.</v>

313
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Take Martin Scorsese's 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>film the departed,</v>

314
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:14.683
<v Speaker 1>which featured Jack Nicholson as chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>gangster Frank Costello from merciless </v>

315
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:19.154
<v Speaker 1>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She felt funny to his refusal to </v>

316
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:22.934
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to any rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a product of my </v>

317
00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:30.731
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my environment to be a product of</v>

318
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

319
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.233
<v Speaker 1>Frank's action seems shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that life is meaningless as you </v>

320
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:41.130
<v Speaker 1>will act accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank,</v>

321
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 1>who we later find out was an FBI </v>
<v Speaker 1>informant sees life as one long struggle</v>

322
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.723
<v Speaker 1>during which any actions that sustain </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for just one more day are entirely </v>

323
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 1>excusable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

324
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:54.930
<v Speaker 1>plenty of other villain archetypes </v>
<v Speaker 1>punctuated the two thousands,</v>

325
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.883
<v Speaker 1>but if the two thousands where a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the villain is creed was no credit </v>

326
00:17:58.601 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've come a long way since then.</v>

327
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.913
<v Speaker 1>Today are villains are the product of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly divided America bracing </v>

328
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:07.740
<v Speaker 1>itself for impact with trust in </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

329
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious faith at all time.</v>

330
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:10.854
<v Speaker 1>Lows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>villains reflect America's innate </v>

331
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:14.880
<v Speaker 1>skepticism towards systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any systems,</v>

332
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.773
<v Speaker 1>all the systems villain simply embody </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions that are way too radical and </v>

333
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:20.574
<v Speaker 1>usually mind bogglingly violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polar opposite of a 19 fifties </v>

334
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.843
<v Speaker 1>villain who represented an evildoer </v>
<v Speaker 1>infiltrating and inherently good system </v>

335
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:29.034
<v Speaker 1>in hopes of corrupting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's villains increasingly face </v>

336
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>objectively evil systems which they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change for the better.</v>

337
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:35.843
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that makes these </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters villains rather than starry </v>

338
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>eyed heroes is their means of carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that change.</v>

339
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.380
<v Speaker 7>You agree to end the war on drugs once </v>
<v Speaker 7>and for all.</v>

340
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.890
<v Speaker 7>My colleagues and I received full legal </v>
<v Speaker 7>immunity.</v>

341
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.700
<v Speaker 1>The classic caveat of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

342
00:18:49.701 --> 00:18:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you'd be really cool if we weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill half the world.</v>

343
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.993
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Panthers killmonger played by </v>

344
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:55.364
<v Speaker 1>Michael B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan has an entirely legitimate </v>

345
00:18:56.961 --> 00:18:57.794
<v Speaker 1>critique of how the world treats its </v>
<v Speaker 1>black citizens and will conduct past </v>

346
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:02.420
<v Speaker 1>severity as they suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

347
00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:03.254
<v Speaker 1>killmonger would argue that the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains of the film are Wakandans who </v>

348
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:06.584
<v Speaker 1>sit on a stockpile of vibranium while </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be a helpless third world </v>

349
00:19:09.801 --> 00:19:10.634
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're killmonger is perspective gets </v>

350
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:14.170
<v Speaker 1>debatably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tricky is in the means.</v>

351
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.103
<v Speaker 1>He wants to ship bill condon weapons all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world and instigate a militant </v>

352
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.330
<v Speaker 1>uprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's going to start over,</v>

353
00:19:20.331 --> 00:19:25.331
<v Speaker 1>and this time we're on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun will never set on the will.</v>

354
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:26.324
<v Speaker 1>Conduct empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though to Cholla defeats him and stops </v>

355
00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:28.934
<v Speaker 1>the scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does go to the UN to admit Wakanda's </v>

356
00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:32.054
<v Speaker 1>real capacities and even establishes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy and outreach center in Oakland </v>

357
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.060
<v Speaker 1>suggesting an end to Wakanda is </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolationism.</v>

358
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.073
<v Speaker 1>So killmonger is radicalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually brought about a less radical </v>

359
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.260
<v Speaker 1>but positive change in policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's mission impossible.</v>

360
00:19:45.261 --> 00:19:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Six is new utilitarian villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August walker slash jog Lark,</v>

361
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.023
<v Speaker 1>who wants to destroy a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in the hopes that the other two </v>

362
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.070
<v Speaker 1>thirds would come together in the wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the attacks,</v>

363
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.113
<v Speaker 1>or as he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been peace without first </v>

364
00:19:58.221 --> 00:19:59.054
<v Speaker 1>the great suffering or the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that created the piece or if it any </v>

365
00:20:02.561 --> 00:20:06.290
<v Speaker 1>worse than those who wants to kill half </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyone to solve resource scarcities</v>

366
00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:09.830
<v Speaker 1>that play for universe or incredibles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two's bill and screen slaver.</v>

367
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:10.763
<v Speaker 1>We use uses hypnotic screens to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control her minions or personal beef </v>

368
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:14.624
<v Speaker 1>with the system that the endless </v>
<v Speaker 1>repackaging of life into consumable </v>

369
00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:18.164
<v Speaker 1>media has made us all lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passive observers and that superheroes </v>

370
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.513
<v Speaker 1>are an integral part of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping us docile and meet her plan to </v>

371
00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:26.600
<v Speaker 1>change the system.</v>

372
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.603
<v Speaker 1>Mind control superheroes and ruined </v>
<v Speaker 1>their public approval rating so people </v>

373
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:32.870
<v Speaker 1>will learn that they have to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

374
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.943
<v Speaker 1>What all these villains share is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>majorly out their plan that appeals to </v>

375
00:20:37.131 --> 00:20:37.964
<v Speaker 1>our country's growing fears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the world is screwed beyond repair </v>

376
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to fix it is to tear it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all down.</v>

377
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.850
<v Speaker 1>In this brave new world of villainy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're able to,</v>

378
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 1>with the villains critique of the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their desire to change it.</v>

379
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>In this through the looking glass </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinterpretation of Villainy,</v>

380
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the heroes are almost inevitably cast as</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly flawed protectors of the status</v>

381
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 1>quo that no one's really happy with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the grand scheme of things,</v>

382
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:02.434
<v Speaker 1>contemporary villains seemed to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird mirror image of fifties villains </v>

383
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.663
<v Speaker 1>who want to corrupt good institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas killmonger types want to effect </v>

384
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 1>good change in corrupt institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just go about it in very bad ways.</v>

385
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.273
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our contemporary villain seemed to have </v>

386
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:17.704
<v Speaker 1>merged the complexity and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent innocence of nineties villains </v>

387
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>while broadening the social critiques of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies and standing in opposition</v>

388
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:25.804
<v Speaker 1>to the nihilism of the two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do believe that there's a cause </v>

389
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:31.780
<v Speaker 1>worth fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they drafted different blueprints</v>

390
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:32.614
<v Speaker 1>for creating social change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might just resurface as complex </v>

391
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.544
<v Speaker 1>heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think are today's </v>

392
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:40.130
<v Speaker 1>villains more interesting than past evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>doers?</v>
