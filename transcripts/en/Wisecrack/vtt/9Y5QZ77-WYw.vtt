00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack disembodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>grab that potato chip because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the animate phenomenon.</v>

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.873
<v Speaker 1>Death note while death note addresses a </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of philosophical topics spanning </v>

5
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>from property rights to human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most interesting is justice.</v>

6
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>What is it and how should it be applied?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice is hardly a new topic in media,</v>

7
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>so why is death notes so special?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well whereas most pop culture gives us a</v>

8
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 1>cut and dry idea of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death note is unique not in what it says</v>

9
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>about justice but how it goes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it.</v>

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Woken was wise crack condition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of death note and even though</v>

11
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>this show is 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Also a quick note about dubs vs subs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like no matter what we do,</v>

13
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:53.114
<v Speaker 1>we somehow do it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're just going to use the dubs on </v>

14
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>this one because it's easier for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with.</v>

15
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.153
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more time for us to read and </v>

16
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>write and make more episodes so please </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hate us.</v>

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Death note follows light your gummy as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he discovers the death.</v>

18
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:06.524
<v Speaker 1>Note a notebook that can kill anyone by </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing their name minute and picturing </v>

19
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.364
<v Speaker 1>their face light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A model student wants to use the death </v>

20
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:13.784
<v Speaker 1>note to create a world devoid of crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon after he adopts the public persona </v>

21
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>of Kira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the god of the new world.</v>

22
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>He hopes to create of course anonymously</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing huge swaths of criminals,</v>

23
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>places him in conflict with various law </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement agencies,</v>

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>a mysterious detective name l and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>two successors and an m in death note.</v>

25
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>We see multiple characters exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is and isn't justice.</v>

26
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say the word comes up a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am justice,</v>

27
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

28
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

29
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.263
<v Speaker 1>but the cool thing is the show doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>give us a clear stance on what </v>

31
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:47.804
<v Speaker 1>constitutes justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather employs a unique method to </v>

32
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>constantly challenge various definitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

33
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.703
<v Speaker 1>An element of that method happens in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual characters propose their own </v>

34
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>version of justice and first among these</v>
<v Speaker 1>is light himself.</v>

35
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get a good sense of who </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked was prior to the death note.</v>

36
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Although we have some clues to his moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>compass,</v>

37
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>it must be something wrong with me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>even consider it.</v>

38
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And his sense of moral obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world is rotting,</v>

39
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>knows who are making it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve to die.</v>

40
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why not me?</v>

41
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Kira is an ends justify the means Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

42
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.763
<v Speaker 1>Essentially the ends of being a crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>zapping uber tyrant justify pretty much </v>

43
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.993
<v Speaker 1>anything including shamelessly using his</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend to distract the police and </v>

44
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>maximize his kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Count</v>

45
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.840
<v Speaker 2>the Berlin and killed my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

46
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Kathy hero</v>

47
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 1>and killing people who aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals who get in his way.</v>

48
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.113
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once light renounces ownership with the </v>

49
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:45.274
<v Speaker 1>notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I here by four fit ownership at this </v>

50
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:47.704
<v Speaker 1>notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loses his memories of being Kira and </v>

51
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>his personality changes noticeably as </v>
<v Speaker 1>does his sense of justice.</v>

52
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 1>He goes from being a by any means </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary kind of dude to a,</v>

53
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't always be asshole kind</v>

54
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>of dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is shown by his refusal to even use</v>

55
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>misses feelings in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

56
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.403
<v Speaker 1>To me exploiting another person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings for personal gain is </v>

57
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>unforgivable and I won't allow myself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoop that low.</v>

58
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>This is a huge change from the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretends to love her for years just </v>

59
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>because it was convenient for killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

60
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Light is even told by me so that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mind being used for his cause.</v>

61
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I already told you I don't care even if </v>
<v Speaker 3>all you're doing here with me</v>

62
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.773
<v Speaker 1>think that would be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he always goes an extra step out of </v>

63
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>the way to break his promises to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is a bit of a boy,</v>

64
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.990
<v Speaker 1>but light minus the notebook seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect me.</v>

65
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>So at least enough not to lead her on,</v>

66
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to come sleep with me tonight?</v>

67
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.190
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

68
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Once he touches the death note again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>regains his memories and powers his Kira</v>

69
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Persona returns and he moves in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Misa almost immediately to get even more</v>

70
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>bonus killing power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

71
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 1>treating people well is thrown out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window for justice with a capital j.</v>

72
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.873
<v Speaker 1>There are countless examples of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension between light pre and post </v>

73
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:02.310
<v Speaker 1>notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they merge more and more toward</v>

74
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.144
<v Speaker 1>the end of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways this is portrayed is </v>

75
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:05.814
<v Speaker 1>through lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with himself or he </v>

76
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 1>grapples with moral and practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilemmas.</v>

77
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Does that split personality sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar?</v>

78
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ross process but you were hosting both </v>

79
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:16.644
<v Speaker 1>death note and Lord of the rings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to send in some an ancient Greek </v>

80
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:20.184
<v Speaker 1>story called the ring of guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially a guy finds a ring that </v>

81
00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:24.234
<v Speaker 1>makes him invisible and using this </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymity he immediately bangs that </v>

82
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:32.010
<v Speaker 1>King's wife kills the king and takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>over whatever spooky Greek magic town he</v>

83
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:32.670
<v Speaker 1>lives in.</v>

84
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.503
<v Speaker 1>We could probably read this as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegory for the perils of Internet </v>

85
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>comment sections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I digress.</v>

86
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.353
<v Speaker 1>In Plato's Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this story raises a lot of questions </v>

87
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:42.654
<v Speaker 1>about the idea of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The character glaucon who was actually </v>

88
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:46.524
<v Speaker 1>plato's real life big brother uses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fable to argue that justice is just the </v>

89
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>kind of social contract that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from hurting each other.</v>

90
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.203
<v Speaker 1>The thought experiment is meant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that people only really </v>

91
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:59.190
<v Speaker 1>value justice for its ability to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them look good.</v>

92
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.323
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only natural that someone within </v>

93
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.603
<v Speaker 1>visibility ring would go around acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an ass hat because people only </v>

94
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:09.540
<v Speaker 1>value justice or morality when their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions can be scrutinized.</v>

95
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Sound familiar?</v>

96
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Humans will always try to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 4>appearances when they're in public.</v>

97
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 4>That's just how we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is how they really feel.</v>

98
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.563
<v Speaker 4>Most are too afraid to support me as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're worried about what others will </v>

99
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many would rather deny my existence,</v>

100
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 4>but on the Internet where you can remain</v>
<v Speaker 4>anonymous,</v>

101
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 4>support for Kita is growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As</v>

102
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 1>soon as the risk of damaging your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation is gone.</v>

103
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.873
<v Speaker 1>So is all your interest in justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glaucon goes on to say that it doesn't </v>

104
00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 1>matter if you were just or unjust before</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting on the ring.</v>

105
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.980
<v Speaker 1>The power will inevitably lead you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bag of dicks and that's okay.</v>

106
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.873
<v Speaker 1>I can use the death note all I want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be punished according to </v>

107
00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:47.144
<v Speaker 1>glaucon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can secretly bang the queen and </v>

108
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:52.700
<v Speaker 1>still keep your reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be way happier than someone who</v>

109
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>cares about justice and banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero Queens.</v>

110
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much a light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boy Valedictorian who puts on a show</v>

111
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.404
<v Speaker 1>of normal morality even when he takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>joy in doing stuff that is probably way </v>

112
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>worse than breaking the Royal Bro Code.</v>

113
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 4>I never once felt cursed since I picked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up the death.</v>

114
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:10.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

115
00:06:10.451 --> 00:06:14.920
<v Speaker 4>the thought never even crossed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happier than I've ever been.</v>

116
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks to this power,</v>

117
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to create a perfect world.</v>

118
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.410
<v Speaker 1>So why do Glau cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musings matter here?</v>

119
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the key questions death </v>
<v Speaker 1>note asks is what does justice mean when</v>

120
00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:27.684
<v Speaker 1>nobody's looking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This theme is repeated in light </v>

121
00:06:29.951 --> 00:06:30.784
<v Speaker 1>pseudonymity as Kira in l n ends </v>
<v Speaker 1>nameless snus and in the anonymity of </v>

122
00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:35.574
<v Speaker 1>the cure supporters later in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's where the republic really </v>

123
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:39.414
<v Speaker 1>comes in handy as a socratic dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far less concerned with offering a </v>

124
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:45.300
<v Speaker 1>theory of justice than it is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailing.</v>

125
00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:46.134
<v Speaker 1>The process of exploring justice in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates and his frenemies use </v>

126
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:50.994
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical scenarios and varying </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions to challenge what </v>

127
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:54.744
<v Speaker 1>constitutes justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death note works in a similar way </v>

128
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.493
<v Speaker 1>showing the movement and evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of justice between and within </v>

129
00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.054
<v Speaker 1>the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the characters and death note </v>

130
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Misa lights and Mika me to name a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that they possess true knowledge</v>

131
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>of justice and the tension between these</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and they're skeptics.</v>

132
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Draw out the real meat of the show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the least subtle scenes,</v>

133
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Speaker 1>both El enlight declare in unison,</v>

134
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

135
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Sentiment is repeated throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>series,</v>

136
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.373
<v Speaker 1>especially in the final episode or light</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims that by reducing violent crime </v>

137
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>and ending wars he has become justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

138
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Kinda has become law in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We now live.</v>

139
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who's maintaining order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have become justice and hear.</v>

140
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:42.814
<v Speaker 1>Death note establishes itself as a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of modern socratic dialogue using </v>

141
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>multiple participants to try and flesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some universal question like what is</v>

142
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:51.604
<v Speaker 1>justice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll the republic from the minute light </v>

143
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>proposes his vision of a new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In episode one,</v>

144
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.393
<v Speaker 1>I want the world to know of my existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's someone out there passing </v>

145
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.314
<v Speaker 1>righteous judgment on the wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of justice is brought into </v>

146
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.840
<v Speaker 1>play while he does struggle with himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a second,</v>

147
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.703
<v Speaker 1>might've passed judgment on others is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first real challenger is rebuke </v>

148
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.233
<v Speaker 1>light sets out his plan to immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill off the worst criminals while </v>

149
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>letting the lesser ones dial,</v>

150
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 4>and only then the world will start </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving in the right direction.</v>

151
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.313
<v Speaker 4>It'll be a new world free of injustice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and populated by people who I've judged </v>

152
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.660
<v Speaker 4>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind and hard working.</v>

153
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.333
<v Speaker 4>But if you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would make you the only one bad </v>

154
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.023
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

155
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Rebuke is motivated by boredom rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than any sense of moral duty,</v>

156
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.723
<v Speaker 1>but he notices the contradiction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights argument beginning the socratic </v>

157
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>dialogue that lasts the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

158
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to chronicle every </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment of this series long philosophical</v>

159
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are definitely some highlights</v>

160
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 1>that show us the trajectory of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

161
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I've got a pretty good idea of what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation might be and I can guess what</v>

162
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you hope to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

163
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing right now is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm evil.</v>

164
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I am justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this wasn't clear enough,</v>

165
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>this is where they end the episode by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling,</v>

166
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I am justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure we get it and did we get it?</v>

167
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

168
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.433
<v Speaker 1>They both think they're justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lights likes to refer to himself as a </v>

169
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>martyr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it means sacrificing my own mind</v>

170
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

171
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.863
<v Speaker 1>Which is pretty weird considering that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he spends years trying to make himself </v>

172
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.704
<v Speaker 1>the ruler of the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you subscribe to his Kwassa </v>

173
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian theory of justice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing criminals and making one person,</v>

174
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>God will ensure peace and happiness for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest number of people,</v>

175
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>then he is sacrificing herself.</v>

176
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.133
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that becoming the god of the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>world will mean becoming more and more </v>

177
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:44.394
<v Speaker 1>Kira slowly killing light tiyaga me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also means that in exchange for </v>

178
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.464
<v Speaker 1>cleaning a rotten world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have to contend with a rotten </v>

179
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.124
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that he acknowledges he had a </v>

180
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>probably knows that what he's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

181
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but he'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change the world even as a martyr at the</v>

182
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 1>cost of his soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his brand of justice.</v>

183
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So this is lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of justice.</v>

184
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>The world needs a Kira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since he was chosen,</v>

185
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>he's willing to sacrifice himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make that happen.</v>

186
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>His idea of justice is an old testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>style bloodbath.</v>

187
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.790
<v Speaker 1>We're sinners get punished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and blasphemy is the biggest sin of all.</v>

188
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Did he mention the veritable monsoon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical imagery in this show?</v>

189
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>You know the churchy coral,</v>

190
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this</v>

191
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>ode to Michelangelo's the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>

192
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.203
<v Speaker 1>the apples everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>l even washes lights feet since like </v>

193
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:37.104
<v Speaker 1>spends most of the show acting is Kira.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The distinction between the two may not </v>

194
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 1>be terribly important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here it seems to represent lights,</v>

195
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.124
<v Speaker 1>ideal version of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only true just world is one </v>

196
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>without criminals achieved by whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>means necessary.</v>

197
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.003
<v Speaker 1>However else speaking as lind l Taylor </v>
<v Speaker 1>highlights the contradictions in cure </v>

198
00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:57.914
<v Speaker 1>his reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a just world is one without </v>

199
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 1>criminality than the criminal act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people is also an injustice.</v>

200
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 1>This resembles rebukes rebuttal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode one,</v>

201
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>but the differences that rebuke stops at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suggestion that light might be bad.</v>

202
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.113
<v Speaker 1>While l offers a competing example not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only as Kira unjust catching Kiera is </v>

203
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.544
<v Speaker 1>itself an act of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show stops short of telling us what </v>

204
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Elva leaves justice is in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that cure is violating it,</v>

205
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of how socratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogues work.</v>

206
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.043
<v Speaker 1>Poking holes and raising questions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get closer to the truth here imagines </v>

207
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>justice as a grand ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A world without criminals.</v>

208
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>L however only talks about justice as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to injustice.</v>

209
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of characters believe in lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal justice,</v>

210
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but others seem to echo l philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Rawls,</v>

211
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:46.944
<v Speaker 1>much like a light and plato argues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to correct injustices in </v>

212
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we first need to have an idea of what is</v>

213
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.993
<v Speaker 1>roles and Plato disagree on a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they both support ideal theory that </v>

214
00:11:58.991 --> 00:11:59.824
<v Speaker 1>when thinking about justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should first try to understand what </v>

215
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:02.854
<v Speaker 1>it would look like in a perfect world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everyone did exactly the right </v>

216
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is justice under ideal conditions,</v>

217
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>which for light and Mika me involve a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people being dead.</v>

218
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.180
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others like philosopher Naomi Zack favor</v>

219
00:12:17.181 --> 00:12:18.014
<v Speaker 1>something called injustice theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This approach does not rely on a </v>

220
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>preexisting ideal of justice and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect just society,</v>

221
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>but rather centers on identifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>injustices where they occur.</v>

222
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.033
<v Speaker 1>It's much more practical to point to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>case of injustice than it is to start </v>

223
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>from a broadly applicable definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is just by this measure.</v>

224
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Only after injustice has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified.</v>

225
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.563
<v Speaker 1>Can Justice be applied to correct it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The L M N Alphabet soups hunt for Keira </v>

226
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.093
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be directed by a belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a high in the sky definition of </v>

227
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather by the recognition that Kiros</v>

228
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>new world is unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since we never get a clear sense of what</v>

229
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.944
<v Speaker 1>else concept of justice is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems totally plausible that he sees </v>

230
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:01.054
<v Speaker 1>justice as the response to injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while light and those similar to him </v>

231
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:05.974
<v Speaker 1>favor a Rawlsian approach of a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>created around a perfect justice l is </v>

232
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 1>more focused on correcting injustices as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they appear,</v>

233
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 1>any definition of the just becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary.</v>

234
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.400
<v Speaker 1>The struggle and resulting dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>between these beliefs characterizes much</v>

235
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>of the philosophical method in the show.</v>

236
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.333
<v Speaker 1>Although other characters like Metsuda </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicate the conversation and prevent </v>

237
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it from being a split between just two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

238
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.843
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should briefly take a second look at </v>

239
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 1>our cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snuffing Sherlock Holmes,</v>

240
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 1>his code of Justice is a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous than lights,</v>

241
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 1>although it's very ambiguity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays an important role.</v>

242
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.990
<v Speaker 1>In many cases it appears that l and n as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as m are most interested in winning</v>

243
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.014
<v Speaker 1>a game of wits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That game may be a symbolic battle </v>

244
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:50.254
<v Speaker 1>between competing moralities or it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be a case of some narcissistic </v>

245
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 1>geniuses obsessed with puzzles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of either case.</v>

246
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:56.824
<v Speaker 1>This lack of any strong convictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a positive meaning of justice </v>

247
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.933
<v Speaker 1>serves at least one critical purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that El frequently plays the </v>

248
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.134
<v Speaker 1>role of inquisitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so different from socrates in the </v>

249
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:08.134
<v Speaker 1>republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another somewhat more surprising </v>

250
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.564
<v Speaker 1>inquisitor is Matt Suda who raises </v>
<v Speaker 1>sincere questions about the moral </v>

251
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>judgments of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kira,</v>

252
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese police l just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

253
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.633
<v Speaker 1>Even at the same time as he is mocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>for his inability to fall into line </v>

254
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>early in the season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he responds to El Speech on the childish</v>

255
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:26.014
<v Speaker 1>morality of Cura by pointing out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent crime in the area has decreased </v>

256
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>since Kira began killing.</v>

257
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.403
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying this to support to know </v>

258
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.263
<v Speaker 6>or to condone the murders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in the last few days throughout the </v>

259
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:39.030
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but especially here in Japan,</v>

260
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.290
<v Speaker 6>we've observed the dramatic decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the number of violent crimes committed.</v>

261
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.240
<v Speaker 1>He makes clear that he does not condone </v>
<v Speaker 1>cure his vision or actions,</v>

262
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 1>but he's also skeptical of the hard line</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken by l.</v>

263
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.673
<v Speaker 1>Later in the series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has an exchange with the other </v>

264
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>members of the task force that calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>into question the very foundation of the</v>

265
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:57.794
<v Speaker 1>squad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief in the inherent evilness of </v>

266
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Kira.</v>

267
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys ever think that maybe cure </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't completely evil?</v>

268
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.650
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of question is that?</v>

269
00:15:05.651 --> 00:15:06.484
<v Speaker 4>Matsuda I've been thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of me just doesn't believe that he </v>

270
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:13.300
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you think Kira has justice too?</v>

271
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.033
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the kid is trying to fight </v>

272
00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:22.240
<v Speaker 4>evil and change the world in his own way</v>
<v Speaker 4>and well the world's become a good place</v>

273
00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:24.190
<v Speaker 4>for people who live honest lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

274
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.393
<v Speaker 1>pseudo with all his self doubt is both </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience surrogate and philosophical </v>

275
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>foil to the other characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike light who is convinced of his own</v>

276
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:33.974
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lnn who are single mindedly obsessed </v>

277
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:37.184
<v Speaker 1>with the task of catching him chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy who is focused on finding the </v>

278
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:40.814
<v Speaker 1>true Kira to clear his son's name and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the task force who have all </v>

279
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:44.864
<v Speaker 1>staked their lives and beliefs on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice of ending Kiera once and for </v>

280
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:48.764
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Suda is constantly questioning the </v>

281
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 1>values that are presented to him as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

282
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.653
<v Speaker 4>Hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I the only one who sees something </v>

283
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.634
<v Speaker 4>wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can go around accusing people of </v>

284
00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:57.794
<v Speaker 4>being cute on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that he's wearing a mask </v>

285
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 4>says he's only trying to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>

286
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 4>not anyone else.</v>

287
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.973
<v Speaker 1>Matt suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His demeanor is very different than the </v>

288
00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:08.830
<v Speaker 1>bravado of Plato's debate club boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he first and foremost recognizes his</v>

289
00:16:08.831 --> 00:16:09.760
<v Speaker 1>own ignorance</v>

290
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.940
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean no way</v>

291
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.950
<v Speaker 1>crucial for revealing the ignorance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those around him.</v>

292
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Even at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he kills light,</v>

293
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.960
<v Speaker 1>he does so with questions rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers.</v>

294
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.520
<v Speaker 4>What was it all for the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what about your dad?</v>

295
00:16:23.521 --> 00:16:25.530
<v Speaker 4>What the hell did he die for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bye.</v>

296
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.473
<v Speaker 1>Forcing the viewers and other characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>to consider their own opinions of </v>

297
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:30.134
<v Speaker 1>Justice Metsuda helps organize a jumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>of competing ideas into a somewhat </v>

298
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.500
<v Speaker 1>intelligible conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Suda,</v>

299
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.363
<v Speaker 1>the modern socrates as 10 years of fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>forums demonstrate there's no real </v>

300
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.134
<v Speaker 1>consensus on who best represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice or whether lights new world </v>

301
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:46.394
<v Speaker 1>justified the means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that ambiguity is what makes the </v>

302
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 1>show so poignant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death note isn't addicting,</v>

303
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:52.574
<v Speaker 1>detective procedural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never abandons the original </v>

304
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 1>question of what makes a just world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most importantly,</v>

305
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.833
<v Speaker 1>it never gives us an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In episode 30 aptly named Justice Light </v>

306
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:05.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty much sums it up.</v>

307
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.720
<v Speaker 4>If kitty gets caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that makes them evil.</v>

308
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.660
<v Speaker 4>But if he wins in rules the world and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>guess he's justice</v>

309
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:11.623
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kira is defeated and ends brand of </v>

310
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:14.594
<v Speaker 1>justice seems to prevail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it leaves us with a feeling that </v>

311
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:17.774
<v Speaker 1>things might have been very different if</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kira had survived the warehouse rather </v>

312
00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>than giving us closure that l n n we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>innately more Justin,</v>

313
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.083
<v Speaker 1>Kira.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea of winner gets all morality </v>

314
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 1>reveals at the war of competing moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>codes was kind of a logic game,</v>

315
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.343
<v Speaker 1>not a kind of truth seeking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could argue that this makes justice </v>

316
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>totally meaningless for the world inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show end might be justice,</v>

317
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.923
<v Speaker 1>but for us the viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite so clear cut in regards </v>

318
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>to the meaning and implications of </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>

319
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.283
<v Speaker 1>Death note opens more doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It closes in terms of whether or not </v>

320
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:56.361
<v Speaker 1>socrates or rawls or Zach would find l </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Kira to be paragons of justice.</v>

321
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.770
<v Speaker 1>The short answer is definitely not.</v>

322
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Although there are some similarities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't address in this video,</v>

323
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 1>like themes of tyranny and a focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means to be a just city.</v>

324
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 1>The real connection between the justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Republic and justice in death.</v>

325
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:10.614
<v Speaker 1>Note is not in their definitions but in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their method and that method </v>

326
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:15.024
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes death note as a show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does philosophy rather than just </v>

327
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>borrowing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching guys piece.</v>

<v Speaker 1>skills of a college freshmen,</v>

338
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.013
<v Speaker 1>our team had no problem following the </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy directions with all the pre </v>

339
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.690
