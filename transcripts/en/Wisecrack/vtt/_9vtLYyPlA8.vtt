00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my main job is twice a year to cover the</v>

2
00:00:06.341 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>collections each season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fall and spring season,</v>

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.643
<v Speaker 1>so we've just had the New York shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fall for spring clothing that will </v>

4
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>be in the stores for spring 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This weekend I will leave to go to Milan</v>

5
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:20.164
<v Speaker 1>and I will spend a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at the clothes from the </v>

6
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:23.044
<v Speaker 1>Italian designers and then that will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by a little weakened </v>

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>adventists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be lovely and then onto a,</v>

8
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>which is a break and then onto Paris for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week of shows there.</v>

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.753
<v Speaker 1>So those are the two main large blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time where I'm literally sitting in </v>

10
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>what the fashion engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would consider to be,</v>

11
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:40.714
<v Speaker 1>what the world would consider trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and they're the fashions fashion </v>

12
00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>shows that are called the collections </v>
<v Speaker 1>for ready to wear those clothes that you</v>

13
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>will see at various department stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>and boutiques all around the country and</v>

14
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>all around the world as well as online.</v>

15
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>That is followed by then a period where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I come back from the fashion collections</v>

16
00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and make some pretty strong decisions on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what trends I like.</v>

17
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>What I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.573
<v Speaker 1>how I've amassed all this large grouping</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plethora of clothes that are kind of </v>

19
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>bombarded me and everyone for about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

20
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense of it all and group them into</v>

21
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.254
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into themes and the things that I think </v>

22
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.204
<v Speaker 1>will be relevant for my publication and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for things that I think will be fun to </v>

23
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>photograph and shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from there I developed the idea,</v>

24
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.903
<v Speaker 1>think about what kind of imagery I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like those ideas to be and think about </v>

25
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the photography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the models,</v>

26
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 1>and how I'm going to actually really </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce that idea.</v>

27
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes an eight page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 page story in the spring issue of New</v>

28
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.003
<v Speaker 1>York magazine.</v>
