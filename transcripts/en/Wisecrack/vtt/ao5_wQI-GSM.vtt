00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Skillshare,</v>

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>a wise crack jared in the pale flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>today we've got an episode for you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon go,</v>

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>urban exploration and some dead French </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>fusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pokemon go temporarily gripped the world</v>

6
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>like an epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The augmented reality mobile game,</v>

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.033
<v Speaker 1>just days after it's released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was installed in five percent of all </v>

8
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>android devices and even surpassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>tinder in downloads.</v>

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>To say that we were gripped by Pocomania</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over again is an understatement.</v>

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>The media and now wisecrack just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't shut up about it.</v>

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon goers have discovered dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies been lured into being robbed,</v>

12
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.984
<v Speaker 1>crash their cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even trolled the Westboro Baptist </v>

13
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

14
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:47.694
<v Speaker 1>plenty of people were less than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered by Pokemongo filmmaker Oliver </v>

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Stone decried the games ramp in data </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection as a new form of surveillance</v>

16
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:55.674
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also warned that the idea of people </v>

17
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.434
<v Speaker 1>running around to catch imaginary </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters as dictated by a giant </v>

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>corporation can go by another name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's Pokemongo a nightmare.</v>

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Confluence of phone addiction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate surveillance.</v>

21
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wise crack addition on </v>

22
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:14.754
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of pokemon go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for once no spoilers ahead at its </v>

23
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:19.644
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pokemon go is a game about walking you </v>

24
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:22.614
<v Speaker 1>saunter to a pokey stop dash towards a </v>
<v Speaker 1>raid stampede towards a dragonite </v>

25
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>trespass into a neighbor's yard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stumble into a crime scene,</v>

26
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.784
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while walking may seem as </v>

27
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>philosophically unimportant as an Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandler movie,</v>

28
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd be surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we can understand how pokemon</v>

29
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>go radically changes how we interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with physical spaces,</v>

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>we need a little history of walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.493
<v Speaker 1>walking played a prominent role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society until the rise of the </v>

32
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:49.764
<v Speaker 1>automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides getting people from point a to </v>

33
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.524
<v Speaker 1>point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking was a sort of sport and </v>

34
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>aristocratic circles as Frederic Gros </v>
<v Speaker 1>writes in his book,</v>

35
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:58.704
<v Speaker 1>a philosophy of walking well to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and women would stroll around in </v>

36
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.693
<v Speaker 1>fancy clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally striking a pose to woo </v>

37
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>potential suitors.</v>

38
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of rich people.</v>

39
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Selfies on Instagram for others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking was a holy matter every year.</v>

40
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Scores of people would undergo a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilgrimage to various sanctified sites.</v>

41
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.223
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche </v>

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.413
<v Speaker 1>saw walking as an invaluable part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical process today are walking </v>

43
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>and movement in general still serves a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social function,</v>

44
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>though it's a little more pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

45
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>our morning commute running to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grocery store,</v>

46
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>picking up sunny Jim from soccer </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

47
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Most of these comings and goings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>programmed into our daily lives.</v>

48
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.143
<v Speaker 1>We move from place to place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally unaware of our surroundings </v>

49
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.193
<v Speaker 1>and never venture far from our planned </v>
<v Speaker 1>route all to fulfill our societal </v>

50
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:50.694
<v Speaker 1>obligations as gross writes this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rushing around is always in the service </v>

51
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.853
<v Speaker 1>of doing something and never to just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking according to gross is in its </v>

52
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.414
<v Speaker 1>purest form about doing nothing which </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows us to rediscover the simple joy </v>

53
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.334
<v Speaker 1>of existing I kind of childlike </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderment with the world surrounding </v>

54
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:09.840
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

55
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Some might argue that pokemongo </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to this logic,</v>

56
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.414
<v Speaker 1>follows the always doing something logic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our time frantically running from </v>

57
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.923
<v Speaker 1>pokestop to pokey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop chasing down legendary rates and </v>

58
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.124
<v Speaker 1>battling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim's isn't exactly the kind of </v>

59
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>exploration grosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing about.</v>

60
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>We'll tackle that in just a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first let's talk about space.</v>

61
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.303
<v Speaker 1>Every street building and open space </v>
<v Speaker 1>carries with it and assumed social code </v>

62
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't behave in an office building </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way you would at a concert.</v>

63
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.153
<v Speaker 1>You don't play football and freeway and </v>
<v Speaker 1>many would say it's important to wear </v>

64
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:43.504
<v Speaker 1>your black sabbath tee shirt to church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those social codes change with time </v>

65
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public bathing used to be a thing.</v>

66
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.153
<v Speaker 1>Bars used to be a place to find a date </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rivers used to be a fine place for </v>

67
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you to drop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trow and do your business.</v>

68
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.903
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon go and the technology it uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>might change everything by radically </v>

69
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>recoding.</v>

70
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.353
<v Speaker 1>This space that we live in the game has </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally mapped onto reality and </v>

71
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>entirely new set of social codes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parks for hiking now,</v>

72
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>more like a sweet place to battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mutu churches for worship now,</v>

73
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>pokey balls for days and it crowd all </v>
<v Speaker 1>running in the same direction could be a</v>

74
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:22.504
<v Speaker 1>Zombie apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could also be an unknown museums </v>

75
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>to memorialize the millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered more like,</v>

76
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.513
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

77
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>don't play pokemon go and the Holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 1>museum in short,</v>

78
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Pokemongo disrupts how we perceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

79
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.513
<v Speaker 1>There's a common fear with pokemon go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we really trust a massive </v>

80
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:43.444
<v Speaker 1>corporation with such intimate knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of where we're going and how we're </v>

81
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:47.104
<v Speaker 1>getting there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a little scary that a company can </v>

82
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.344
<v Speaker 1>so artfully tell us where to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Niantic has integrated sponsored pokey </v>

83
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>stops and starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

84
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.734
<v Speaker 1>was more than happy to oblige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is you get to buy a Pumpkin </v>

85
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.533
<v Speaker 1>Spice Latte once you've decided to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>a break from catching mythical monsters </v>

86
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from some sponsored pokey sops,</v>

87
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.173
<v Speaker 1>that intake has taken the high road </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizing things like beach cleanups </v>

88
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.033
<v Speaker 1>for Earth Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it can't go </v>

89
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>downhill fairly quickly.</v>

90
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.373
<v Speaker 1>What if you could pay niantic a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars to have a rare pokemon </v>

91
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:21.544
<v Speaker 1>spawn at your political rally or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends Improv show for French </v>

92
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy Debord.</v>

93
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Modern capitalism has neatly organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and physical space.</v>

94
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're going and when we're getting</v>

95
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>there is a function of the totalizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

96
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>The economy plays in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We traveled through life,</v>

97
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>mesmerized by our commodity filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

98
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>We go to work to make money to a leisure</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

99
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>to spend money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>

100
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.763
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and repeat with a sort of systemic </v>

101
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>pressure to do this in a more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive way.</v>

102
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Work harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy more sleepless.</v>

103
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>You get the idea for some pokemon go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily fits this dystopic narrative.</v>

104
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.233
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were mesmerized by billboards and </v>

105
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>where they told us to go probably to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some tgi Friday's today.</v>

106
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>We're mesmerized by our phone screens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and where they tell us to go.</v>

107
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>What's missing from all this is chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randomness and discovery,</v>

108
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but before you think we're being overly </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid,</v>

109
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>edge Laura's those who decry pokemon go </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the harbinger of some dystopic,</v>

110
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:28.481
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality are only half right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pokemongo as Edwin Montoya's rewrites in</v>

111
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.260
<v Speaker 1>the Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Review of books resembles deary.</v>

112
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.343
<v Speaker 1>A revolutionary strategy proposed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>debord to combat the entrenched and </v>

113
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.620
<v Speaker 1>alienated ways in which we move through </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities do receive,</v>

114
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.503
<v Speaker 1>which is French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for drifting means abandoning the </v>

115
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>preprogrammed way in which we interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with cities.</v>

116
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>By performing a sort of experiment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

117
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>wandering around aimlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debord encourages people to walk around,</v>

118
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>be drawn in by their surroundings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogate them,</v>

119
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.480
<v Speaker 1>and to give themselves up to randomness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of what pokemon go does.</v>

120
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.743
<v Speaker 1>Players venture to locations they never </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have dreamed of going to namely </v>

121
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're anything like me,</v>

122
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 1>you've discovered new neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new landmarks,</v>

123
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and even this one's a shocker.</v>

124
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.593
<v Speaker 1>Made friends in the myspace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon go is combating the kind of </v>

125
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>social alienation that our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>actively promotes.</v>

126
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most games have you glued to a screen </v>

127
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 1>with headphones on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon go encourages you to explore and</v>

128
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>make new friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the raid system was introduced,</v>

129
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.063
<v Speaker 1>you could battle boss level pokemon for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a limited time with friends or </v>

130
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also recently rolled out trading,</v>

131
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>adding new ways to meet new people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists,</v>

132
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.143
<v Speaker 1>we've been noticed that the game was </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping their patients with anxiety and </v>

133
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>depression by getting them to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and socialize in this way,</v>

134
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 1>pokemon go actively recode's the space </v>
<v Speaker 1>around us in a positive way.</v>

135
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.423
<v Speaker 1>It might not be exactly the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary walking that debord </v>

136
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>envision or the useless kind of walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross writes about,</v>

137
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.803
<v Speaker 1>but it's also better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative that are tech obsessed </v>

138
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>society offers us.</v>

139
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.843
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe pokemon go is a gateway drug for </v>

140
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:07.634
<v Speaker 1>hiking and social interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think wise crack is pokemon </v>
