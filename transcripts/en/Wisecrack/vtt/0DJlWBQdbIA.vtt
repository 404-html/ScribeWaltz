1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>There's a statistic that over 90% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go home at the end of the day </v>

2
00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.004
<v Speaker 1>feeling unfulfilled by their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the difference between liking </v>

3
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>your job and loving your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can like your job,</v>

4
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>but do you love your job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over 90% of the people who,</v>

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>who work these days don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.163
<v Speaker 1>and I imagine a world in which that </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistic is completely reversed in </v>

7
00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:20.554
<v Speaker 1>which the vast majority of people go </v>
<v Speaker 1>home at the end of the day feeling </v>

8
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.154
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled by the work that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that they've contributed to </v>

9
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than the bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

10
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a pretty happy go lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.933
<v Speaker 1>But about five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reached a point in my career where my </v>

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>passion was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.423
<v Speaker 1>I stopped loving what I was doing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>even got to the point where I didn't </v>

14
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>really like it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for a happy person,</v>

15
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>just being unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was bad enough.</v>

16
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And it was this point in my life that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>made this discovery,</v>

17
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:49.264
<v Speaker 1>this thing called the why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I learned is that every single </v>

18
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>organization on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even our own careers,</v>

19
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 1>function on three levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do,</v>

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>how we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why we do it.</v>

21
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.093
<v Speaker 1>These are the things that we think make </v>
<v Speaker 1>us different or special compared to </v>

22
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:04.024
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But very few of us can clearly </v>

23
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:06.754
<v Speaker 1>articulate why we do what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean to earn a living or </v>

24
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>provide for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a results by why.</v>

25
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:13.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your purpose?</v>

26
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>What's your cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your belief?</v>

27
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.243
<v Speaker 1>And after I learned my why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally stopped telling people what </v>

28
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I did and only started telling them what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed.</v>

29
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.793
<v Speaker 1>And not only was my passion restored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mike Career and my life changed </v>

30
00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>dramatically and took on an in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely new path with,</v>

31
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with vastly more meaning.</v>
