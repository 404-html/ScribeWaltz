00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by wix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about Kanye West.</v>

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>The years 2009 at the MTV video music </v>
<v Speaker 1>awards killer.</v>

3
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Swift wins an award over beyonce and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might remember what happened next.</v>

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you finish of the best videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Goes on to apologize and then apologize </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it all gets very confusing.</v>

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward to 2016 and Kanye track </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous features.</v>

7
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>This slide</v>

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 2>appeal like me and Taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my still as sex.</v>

9
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Why I made that famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made that.</v>

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It's famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet got mad.</v>

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.673
<v Speaker 1>Taylor swift got mad and then audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out that Taylor swift knew about </v>

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>and even encouraged the song from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Me and Taylor might still have six.</v>

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 3>and I really appreciate you telling me </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

16
00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 3>That's really nice.</v>

17
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seemingly insignificant example </v>

19
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>perfectly explained our current cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political predicament and it all has</v>

20
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>to do with a concept from professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling called,</v>

21
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.113
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we pay attention to these guys will </v>

22
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>be able to better understand what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with these guys.</v>

23
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.473
<v Speaker 1>If we're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be the case that wrestling </v>

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>truly can explain everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the wide world of Kayfabe,</v>

25
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.543
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into it and want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give a shout out to our sponsor over at </v>

26
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:30.724
<v Speaker 1>Wix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever thought about creating </v>

27
00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:32.554
<v Speaker 1>your own website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will give you total creative </v>

28
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>freedom to make a professional and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging website for any occasion,</v>

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.763
<v Speaker 1>we even whipped up a site using their </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool community features so you guys can </v>

30
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>vote on what kind of content you want us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make.</v>

31
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More on that at the end of the video,</v>

32
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the show.</v>

33
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.913
<v Speaker 1>So what is it's a term used to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in which professional wrestling </v>

34
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:52.414
<v Speaker 1>consists of staged events and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predetermined narratives that are </v>

35
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:55.834
<v Speaker 1>treated as true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though everyone knows that </v>

36
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>wrestling is scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still treat it like a real athletic</v>

37
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:02.164
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even when wrestlers are off the </v>

38
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:04.864
<v Speaker 1>clock and out of the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never acknowledged this as this </v>

39
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>would constitute the unholy sin known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking Kayfabe.</v>

40
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>You never break Kayfabe</v>

41
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>the put this commitment to Kayfabe into </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

42
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:21.614
<v Speaker 1>This would basically be like if Matt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Damon refused to accept his drink at </v>

43
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:25.034
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless the Barista called out the name </v>

44
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Jason Bourne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now wrestling fans aren't idiots.</v>

45
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:30.974
<v Speaker 1>They of course know that the fights are </v>
<v Speaker 1>scripted and that the wrestlers are </v>

46
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:34.394
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the truth of the events </v>

47
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the story.</v>

48
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not true because it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true because it's entertaining.</v>

49
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

50
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just apply to any reality show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may or may not be true.</v>

51
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>You as this would make 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern entertainment Kayfabe.</v>

52
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.993
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kayfabe refers who entertainment in </v>

53
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.244
<v Speaker 1>which staged events are presented as </v>
<v Speaker 1>real by those producing them and </v>

54
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>perceived as real by those consuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

55
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like Santa Claus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows he's fake,</v>

56
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>but because we're all in on it,</v>

57
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.513
<v Speaker 1>and this time we agree with you Dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in case any kiddos are watching </v>

58
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:18.204
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be upset while Santa Claus is a </v>

59
00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is God,</v>

60
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:22.224
<v Speaker 1>so remove the shackles from your tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>souls and dare to live a life beyond </v>

61
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much like John Cena,</v>

62
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.483
<v Speaker 1>Kayfabe didn't stick to just wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>for long and in a manner reminiscent of </v>

63
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne Johnson himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

64
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>faith has now infected the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment industry and as we'll soon</v>

65
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:39.414
<v Speaker 1>see our lives and while professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling is unsurprisingly full of </v>

66
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:44.184
<v Speaker 1>Floridians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another famous floridian has used </v>

67
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Kayfabe in a seemingly unlikely medium </v>
<v Speaker 1>rap music.</v>

68
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.783
<v Speaker 1>Rick Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is basically the Santa Claus of </v>

69
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:53.304
<v Speaker 1>Miami,</v>

70
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 4>goes on the phone with June.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The static DC coming,</v>

71
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>has built a career on the narrative that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a legendary Boston,</v>

72
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:06.631
<v Speaker 1>the drug game comparing himself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthuse kingpins and countless songs.</v>

73
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.270
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures leaked,</v>

74
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:15.104
<v Speaker 1>which revealed that the boss with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly full of Rosa spent his younger </v>

75
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>years as a corrections officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rather than ducking the law,</v>

76
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.763
<v Speaker 1>Rick Ross was enforcing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many assumed this would be the end of </v>

77
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 1>his career.</v>

78
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.270
<v Speaker 5>How do you feel about Boston giving you </v>
<v Speaker 5>an officer Reiki?</v>

79
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.523
<v Speaker 5>I just want to hear it from you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm worth too much money to even </v>

80
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.180
<v Speaker 5>be side tracked on his copy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

81
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.133
<v Speaker 1>it had very little effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ross responded with a fakeness that </v>

82
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>would make a French new wave fan proud </v>
<v Speaker 1>about who rosa is.</v>

83
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:46.794
<v Speaker 1>This about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when anywhere I go and I step in the </v>

84
00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:49.430
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it down.</v>

85
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>People know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Authentic right here they know is real,</v>

86
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>so this go get this money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make this music and his career has</v>

87
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:56.444
<v Speaker 1>only grown since Kayfabe can help us </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand this as the fans prefer the </v>

88
00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:01.484
<v Speaker 1>narrative of Ross as a Miami drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingpin over the truth of his career in </v>

89
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement and why would Ross care </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's true and what's not?</v>

90
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 1>As long as he's selling records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see another use of Kayfabe in the</v>

91
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:13.844
<v Speaker 1>world of Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most infamous brothers Bill Paul in a </v>

92
00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>move that would likely confused Rick </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ross.</v>

93
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 1>The two brothers often engage in a back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth beef via youtube videos,</v>

94
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 1>along with making Aaron Carter look </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore by comparison.</v>

95
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.403
<v Speaker 1>Thirty four slash seven from this battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be best to analyze as a clever use </v>

96
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:37.244
<v Speaker 1>of Kayfabe to gain the youtube algorithm</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the brothers and more clicks and </v>

97
00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>more dollars and just in case Rick Ross </v>
<v Speaker 1>is watching this,</v>

98
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.610
<v Speaker 1>rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will gladly send you a free,</v>

99
00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:47.444
<v Speaker 1>wise crack Hoodie if you post your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>rap video that shuts the Paul's up once </v>

100
00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>and for all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for us did this.</v>

101
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.923
<v Speaker 1>It would make him a shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a cafe term for someone who </v>

102
00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>makes the and wrestling</v>

103
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 6>real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Before we go on.</v>

104
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 6>It's worth noting how Kayfabe is also </v>
<v Speaker 6>distinct from satire,</v>

105
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.800
<v Speaker 6>while for both the performer</v>

106
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.663
<v Speaker 1>and the audience are in on the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satire is used precisely to point us </v>

107
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>toward the absurdity of the actual truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than create a new one.</v>

108
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.200
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Colbert engaged in satire on the</v>

109
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:17.034
<v Speaker 1>Colbert report.</v>

110
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't even see race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not even my own.</v>

111
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.423
<v Speaker 6>People tell me I'm white and I believed </v>
<v Speaker 6>them because I just devoted six minutes </v>

112
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 6>to explaining how I'm not a racist,</v>

113
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.580
<v Speaker 1>as his character was used to exemplify </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absurdity of cable news.</v>

114
00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:31.414
<v Speaker 1>Host Bill O'reilly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Info wars host Alex Jones can be </v>

115
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>better analyze via Kayfabe.</v>

116
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm a pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm an explorer.</v>

117
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm a human and I'm coming</v>

118
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.300
<v Speaker 1>is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Claims are always presented in the guise</v>

119
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.480
<v Speaker 1>of political truth and the audience buys</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the narrative.</v>

120
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.703
<v Speaker 1>The cold air and O'reilly example can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us understand another set of terms </v>

121
00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:53.274
<v Speaker 1>used by Kayfabe faces and heals faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to the good guys in wrestling </v>

122
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.433
<v Speaker 1>and heels are the bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while we might outwardly route for </v>

123
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:02.424
<v Speaker 1>the faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heels are the ones who sell the </v>

124
00:07:04.231 --> 00:07:05.064
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can help explain the polarization </v>

125
00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:09.150
<v Speaker 1>of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heels are where the money is,</v>

126
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 1>so o'reilly and Co had their heel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama.</v>

127
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.693
<v Speaker 6>What President Obama does not understand</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that he has lost all credibility in </v>

128
00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:16.840
<v Speaker 6>matters of security</v>

129
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.430
<v Speaker 1>and now the liberal media has found </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ultimate heal in trump.</v>

130
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.323
<v Speaker 1>What he saying was not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be thinking that if </v>

131
00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Kayfabe only applies to the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why should I care?</v>

132
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that Dwayne,</v>

133
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely does matter because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying reality is that Kayfabe is an</v>

134
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>even better tool for understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary politics.</v>

135
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty Sixteen New York Times article by</v>

136
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Gordon was titled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everything wrestling,</v>

137
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>which we might rephrase as is our world </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming one elaborate Kayfabe take Alex</v>

138
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.983
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's known for his subtle </v>

139
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.140
<v Speaker 1>political arguments,</v>

140
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 6>destroy the corrupt them all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is their plan people.</v>

141
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 6>These are demons</v>

142
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.970
<v Speaker 1>and stellar advertising campaigns for </v>
<v Speaker 1>legit medical supplements.</v>

143
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Heat recently used to his defense in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>court of law</v>

144
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 6>attorney Randal willhite said Jones is </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing a character on his radio show.</v>

145
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.203
<v Speaker 1>Just claim doesn't change the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>his show is considered a new source by </v>

146
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.160
<v Speaker 1>his millions of viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

147
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it can be fun to play with this persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Democrat either.</v>

148
00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idealist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pizzagate scandal shows the dark</v>

149
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:27.370
<v Speaker 1>side of Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brand of political Kayfabe.</v>

150
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.833
<v Speaker 1>Kayfabe isn't just being used for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of fringe media being kicked off </v>

151
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:34.240
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all over TV news as well.</v>

152
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.680
<v Speaker 1>CNN has acknowledged that their primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim is not objective news,</v>

153
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but rather entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to a New York Times profile of</v>

154
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:44.830
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Jeff Zucker as Zucker sees it,</v>

155
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.460
<v Speaker 1>his pro trump panelists are not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spokespeople for a worldview.</v>

156
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.520
<v Speaker 1>They are characters in a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Members of CNNS extended ensemble cast.</v>

157
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.753
<v Speaker 1>Michelle Wolf recently out how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable news depends on heels and </v>

158
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>constructed narratives.</v>

159
00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.723
<v Speaker 7>Watching the host act like the guest </v>
<v Speaker 7>forced his way into the studio is so </v>

160
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.624
<v Speaker 7>compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you almost forget that he was invited </v>

161
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.834
<v Speaker 7>on.</v>

162
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest example of political kayfabe</v>

163
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>might be the 45th president of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

164
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Donald J dot trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No stranger to reality TV.</v>

165
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Trump is the first politician to fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace the power of Kayfabe.</v>

166
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Trump has made a number of claims that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are clearly untrue.</v>

167
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I know more about isis than the generals</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

168
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:30.534
<v Speaker 1>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the largest audience to ever </v>

169
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:33.174
<v Speaker 1>witness an inauguration period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course his threats against his </v>

170
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>old trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>

171
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.633
<v Speaker 8>It's just awfully good that someone with</v>
<v Speaker 8>the temperament of Donald trump is not </v>

172
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 8>in charge of the law in our country </v>
<v Speaker 8>because you'd be in jail.</v>

173
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>How does much truth behind them as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beef between stone cold and the rock,</v>

174
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>but just like Rick Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his criminal past.</v>

175
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.723
<v Speaker 1>It's the narrative that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the facts from maybe especially </v>

176
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:58.704
<v Speaker 1>extreme in his political Kayfabe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but politicians across the spectrum use </v>

177
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:02.904
<v Speaker 1>it just as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Democrats have been vocal in </v>

178
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>their support for fighting against </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change.</v>

179
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.973
<v Speaker 1>The DNC is also recently backtracked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're banned from taking donations </v>

180
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:11.724
<v Speaker 1>from the fossil fuel lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course this won't stop their </v>

181
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>narrative of being the party of </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalism.</v>

182
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.383
<v Speaker 1>So why is Kayfabe having a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most obvious answer is that it </v>

183
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:22.824
<v Speaker 1>allows people to ground reality in </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative rather than empirical truth </v>

184
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>and who wouldn't want to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an exciting story full of heroes and</v>

185
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.533
<v Speaker 1>villains and escalating drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Jeremy Gordon said in the New York </v>

186
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a story is well told,</v>

187
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 1>if it's history seems consistent than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the machinations,</v>

188
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>putting it into place can be temporarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlooked or turned into a fun story of</v>

189
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>their own and why not?</v>

190
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.693
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all marks for a world we want to </v>

191
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:50.994
<v Speaker 1>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this brings us to our last Kayfabe </v>

192
00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 1>vocab term of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

193
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>which is a fan who was so excited to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

194
00:10:57.811 --> 00:10:58.644
<v Speaker 1>a narrative that they lose sight of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fictional nature and treat it as real </v>

195
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 1>for the mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about what is true,</v>

196
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.423
<v Speaker 1>it's about what they want to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this might be the danger of Kayfabe </v>

197
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.433
<v Speaker 1>when it turns from a principle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment into a practical </v>

198
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:13.944
<v Speaker 1>philosophy writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Rogers had this to say in the New </v>

199
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.573
<v Speaker 1>York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy isn't merely a suspension of </v>

200
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It his philosophy about truth itself.</v>

201
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.693
<v Speaker 1>It rests on the assumption that feelings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are inherently more trustworthy than </v>

202
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:28.610
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

203
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Babes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosophy replaces reason and </v>

204
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 1>objectivity in the favor of emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

205
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.023
<v Speaker 1>and the most dangerous part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of cafe is that we might not even </v>

206
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 1>realize that we are in fact marks of our</v>
