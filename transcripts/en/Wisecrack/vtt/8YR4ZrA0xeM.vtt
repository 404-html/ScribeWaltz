00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by verve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.333
<v Speaker 1>wise crack Helen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jarrod's taking a breather this </v>

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.843
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I have the honor of telling </v>

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:13.824
<v Speaker 1>you guys all about one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>beloved and Van Request An enemies in </v>

5
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>wise crack history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy Bebop,</v>

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're finally doing it.</v>

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So what's taken us so long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.763
<v Speaker 1>when we sat down to analyze what makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboy bebop stow amazing from it's </v>

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>super fluid fight scenes too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 1>Grab bag of a soundtrack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kept running into the same problem.</v>

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Every episode is a kaleidoscope of </v>
<v Speaker 1>references,</v>

12
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>philosophies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives and forms.</v>

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>It seems downright impossible to pull on</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one thread.</v>

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Then around the beginning of season two </v>
<v Speaker 1>we noticed this interstitial,</v>

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be hard to read,</v>

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>but it says then in 2071 in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>the bounty hunters who are gathering in </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship Bebop,</v>

18
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll play freely without fear of risky </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>They must create new dreams and films by</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking traditional styles.</v>

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>The work which becomes a new genre </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself will be called Cowboy bebop.</v>

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>If those last two sentences about </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking traditional styles and creating</v>

22
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>a new genre that really gave us pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>cowboy bebop isn't just about great </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and deep thoughts.</v>

24
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It's about blurring the line between </v>
<v Speaker 1>three distinct genres,</v>

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Saifai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>westerns and no arm.</v>

26

<v Speaker 1>Now back to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First a quick refresher course set in </v>

33
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.304
<v Speaker 1>the year 2071 cowboy bebop follows a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of starving bounty hunters who </v>

34
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>wonder from planet to planet looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their next meal ticket.</v>

35
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.403
<v Speaker 1>There's jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former detective who's rocking the </v>

36
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:03.744
<v Speaker 1>robocop look on his left arm spike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modern take on the Marlboro man mixed </v>

37
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 1>with the tragic mob back story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They authentic,</v>

38
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>they tall dealing with gambling problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a serious case of Amnesia.</v>

39
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a brilliant hacker.</v>

41
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

42
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>she's just it together in more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodic fashion.</v>

43
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.063
<v Speaker 1>The team hunts down fugitives while </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoveling down some pretty meager meals </v>

44
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>aside from an ongoing fight with hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thread you'll notice in cowboy</v>

45
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>bebop is its unique take on the side by </v>
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>

46
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.293
<v Speaker 1>The show challenges our idea of Scifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but presenting a future that doesn't </v>

47
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>really have much to do with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

48
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.163
<v Speaker 1>There are all the familiar trappings </v>
<v Speaker 1>here after the destruction of a giant </v>

49
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:48.414
<v Speaker 1>space portal that lets you travel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe at and your lightspeed earth </v>

50
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:51.864
<v Speaker 1>has been left near uninhabitable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind has spread throughout the </v>

51
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:55.764
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

52
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>And for those of you who grew up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like star wars or Gundam Wing,</v>

53
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice a medley of conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epic space battles check terrifying,</v>

54
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>mysterious alien creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check space terrorist.</v>

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.373
<v Speaker 1>Sure why not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the longer you inhabit the world of </v>

56
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy Bebop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you realize it's brand of Scifi</v>

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>isn't about portraying the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.073
<v Speaker 1>it feels more like the 90s and it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>2071 cities here aren't the shining </v>

59
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>beacons on the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That future is and promised us.</v>

60
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Instead they're dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost run down.</v>

61
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.763
<v Speaker 1>Hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole space colony full of </v>

62
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>drifters and riff raff and technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't exactly 70 years ahead of its time</v>

63
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take session seven for example,</v>

64
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.183
<v Speaker 1>heavy metal queen in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the ins and outs of space </v>

65
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>transportation through the lens of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best truck or there is the tea,</v>

66
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>but it quickly becomes apparent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much hasn't changed for future trucking.</v>

67
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Space trucks are still adorned with hood</v>
<v Speaker 1>ornaments.</v>

68
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Their cabins are still cramps to cedars </v>
<v Speaker 1>crammed with personal knickknacks.</v>

69
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.373
<v Speaker 1>They even communicate via radio add </v>
<v Speaker 1>though on La [inaudible] whole new </v>

70
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] radio people and when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to wind down there,</v>

71
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:04.464
<v Speaker 1>relax at crappy rest stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which look identical to the ones I've </v>

72
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>seen in west Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on here?</v>

73
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.383
<v Speaker 1>What are we to make of Psi Phi that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really make use of the science </v>

74
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>part in a flashier way as wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite ray Bradbury tells us,</v>

75
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>science fiction is the fiction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions.</v>

76
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Revolutions in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

77
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel and thought.</v>

78
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.433
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction is the fiction of warm </v>

79
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:29.674
<v Speaker 1>blooded human men and women sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated and sometimes crushed by their </v>

80
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

81
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>at the heart of any good Saifai story </v>
<v Speaker 1>then are the people and their stories in</v>

82
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>which machines are only apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bradbury's.</v>

83
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Words go a long way in explaining why we</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually see stories and cowboy bebop</v>

84
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>that are surprisingly light on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that surrounds them.</v>

85
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps there's no better example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this then Fay Valentine.</v>

86
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faye is a victim of sciences progress.</v>

87
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>When she and her family traveled to </v>
<v Speaker 1>space aboard their private shuttle,</v>

88
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.843
<v Speaker 1>something goes horribly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaving Fay as the only survivor about </v>

89
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>her injuries are so severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctors decide to cryogenically free</v>

90
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>sir until she can be saved by later </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical advancements.</v>

91
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.613
<v Speaker 1>Over 50 years pass and Faye is awoken by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questionably named physician doctor </v>

92
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Baucus except there's only one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas.</v>

93
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>It they all had to go to dona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

94
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>She lost her memory worse because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate exploded while she was frozen.</v>

95
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no surviving data on who fay </v>
<v Speaker 1>even was before.</v>

96
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.653
<v Speaker 2>Id this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the juvenile machine </v>

97
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

98
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.230
<v Speaker 1>and did we mention she's now drowning in</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt checky had I not done yet.</v>

99
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Despite science and technology nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwing Fay at every turn,</v>

100
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.653
<v Speaker 1>they story is never folded into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning about the future or it's </v>

101
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.954
<v Speaker 1>technology instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phase journey is all about finding a </v>

102
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.854
<v Speaker 1>place to belong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty common literary trope across </v>

103
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:14.111
<v Speaker 1>all genres at the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah,</v>

104
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>two button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

105
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Elements of science fiction setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phase narrative,</v>

106
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.183
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>silent cues that help move the conflict </v>

107
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:33.460
<v Speaker 1>along by letting science elements do </v>
<v Speaker 1>their work in the background.</v>

108
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy bebop really thrust its </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters into the spotlight,</v>

109
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe why with only 10 out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>26 episodes exploring our heroes,</v>

110
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:41.914
<v Speaker 1>personal stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still able to relate so much to </v>

111
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

112
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:46.294
<v Speaker 1>Guys who did not feel like crying when </v>
<v Speaker 1>phages lies down in the wreckage of her </v>

113
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:50.044
<v Speaker 1>childhood home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But saifai isn't the only genre cowboy </v>

114
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:58.321
<v Speaker 1>bebop works in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

115
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 1>if the title wasn't enough of a dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>giveaway.</v>

116
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy bebop also plays heavily with </v>
<v Speaker 1>western conventions more than anything.</v>

117
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:08.284
<v Speaker 1>The first session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid blues really sets the tone and </v>

118
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.004
<v Speaker 1>the episode Jen and Spike Hunt Down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer asthma of Solon son and his </v>

119
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:20.191
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend catarina in Tiawana there </v>
<v Speaker 1>saloon fights and Stetson hats.</v>

120
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.393
<v Speaker 1>Indigenous wise men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we even see spike wearing a Poncho and </v>

121
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.454
<v Speaker 1>Sombrero at one point and true to form </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the episodes ending itself is an </v>

122
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:29.194
<v Speaker 1>homage to classic western themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catarina realizing the jet and the </v>

123
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:36.430
<v Speaker 1>authorities are closing in on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sides to take drastic action.</v>

124
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Adios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As literary critic Peter French notes.</v>

125
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.740
<v Speaker 1>While rare when suicide is depicted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westerns,</v>

126
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 1>it has shown to be the escape of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week or the defeated.</v>

127
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.383
<v Speaker 1>For French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though nothing characterizes westerns </v>

128
00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:58.030
<v Speaker 1>more than death and that's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>true in cowboy bebop,</v>

129
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.373
<v Speaker 1>French rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Western is about a dead man's walk </v>

130
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 1>or run or Gallup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not accidental that so many of the</v>

131
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:06.814
<v Speaker 1>heroes and villains of Westerns are </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed as having a previous history </v>

132
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 1>in the American civil war on the losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>confederate side.</v>

133
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.870
<v Speaker 1>They have been defeated and lift with </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and Gore in a cause.</v>

134
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:17.704
<v Speaker 1>They we are led to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw either as they're inescapable duty </v>

135
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.960
<v Speaker 1>or as romantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a man's only good for one.</v>

136
00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:28.720
<v Speaker 1>All did at time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took mine to the confederate states of</v>

137
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>America today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Sam.</v>

138
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.250
<v Speaker 1>This concept of a dead man's walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes particularly relevant with spike</v>

139
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.383
<v Speaker 1>just as Western heroes aimlessly wander </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life carrying the burden of the </v>

140
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.140
<v Speaker 1>romantic cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has now been extinguished so to,</v>

141
00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:47.800
<v Speaker 1>to spike meander through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying his tragic romance with him,</v>

142
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.540
<v Speaker 1>a romance that almost killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first detail we learn about spike is</v>

143
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:55.370
<v Speaker 1>that he's already died once before my</v>

144
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.130
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>

145
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.510
<v Speaker 3>What did I [inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

146
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.950
<v Speaker 1>a former Hitman for the Red Dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syndicate.</v>

147
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Spike wanted to escape with the love of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life.</v>

148
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.123
<v Speaker 1>Julia after performing one last job </v>
<v Speaker 1>except Julianne never showed up and the </v>

149
00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:12.980
<v Speaker 1>spikes partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

150
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.410
<v Speaker 1>let's just say he's named vicious for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

151
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.633
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spike barely managed to escape with his </v>

152
00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:19.394
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everyone in his old life believing </v>

153
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:21.824
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead of washing his hands of </v>

154
00:09:23.661 --> 00:09:24.494
<v Speaker 1>everything spike holds on old in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nola just as French described with </v>

155
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:32.864
<v Speaker 1>Westerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spike can never fully tear himself away </v>

156
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:35.774
<v Speaker 1>from his bloody past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's to bring a bounty on his </v>

157
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>former boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall socket,</v>

158
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.123
<v Speaker 1>Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mono cause she said when you got or to </v>

159
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.173
<v Speaker 1>chase after the woman he loves or to </v>
<v Speaker 1>settle the score with vicious spike </v>

160
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:52.541
<v Speaker 1>returns time and time again to his past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considering Spike nearly dies every time</v>

161
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:53.834
<v Speaker 1>he runs after his past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to wonder what duty could be </v>

162
00:09:56.151 --> 00:09:56.984
<v Speaker 1>so important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since he once told Faye that </v>

163
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>the past doesn't matter anymore.</v>

164
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.913
<v Speaker 4>Dakota,</v>

165
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.460
<v Speaker 3>golden winkeljohn and Blah,</v>

166
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 4>doug about</v>

167
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.583
<v Speaker 1>cargo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the water meter you out with that </v>

168
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.620
<v Speaker 1>all well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digging deeper into the genre,</v>

169
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.543
<v Speaker 1>the answer isn't too much of a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As literary critic Jane Tompkins notes </v>

170
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:20.014
<v Speaker 1>in her book west of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heroes and villains of Westerns </v>

171
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.360
<v Speaker 1>aren't concerned with traditional Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian ethics.</v>

172
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.553
<v Speaker 1>The harsh reality of the desert and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're outlawed in lifestyles won't </v>

173
00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 1>allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

174
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.660
<v Speaker 1>their moral code revolves around honor </v>
<v Speaker 1>as French elaborates.</v>

175
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>What after all is the value of residents</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Kingdom of Heaven?</v>

176
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.123
<v Speaker 1>If the cost is one self respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this in almost every character </v>

177
00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:45.610
<v Speaker 1>from spikes past but most vividly in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious,</v>

178
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.803
<v Speaker 1>vicious ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sociopath holds a mite is right </v>

179
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.000
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who can't or won't fight according</v>

180
00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:52.834
<v Speaker 1>to vicious shouldn't be allowed to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason why he killed his boss </v>

181
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.763
<v Speaker 1>and later stage to coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the reason why he seeks to </v>

182
00:10:59.111 --> 00:10:59.944
<v Speaker 1>kill spike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who has renounced his violent </v>

183
00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:02.270
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

184
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 3>We'll wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] this new shoe modeling.</v>

185
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Some of you came on though so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

186
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Son Christopher Nolan,</v>

187
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.180
<v Speaker 1>but even vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly wants a fair fight with spike.</v>

188
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 1>He passed up easy opportunities to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mortal foe when spike was passed out</v>

189
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 1>on one of Jupiter's moons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This just leaves him unharmed,</v>

190
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.440
<v Speaker 1>mostly tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

191
00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not at the home and when spike and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious or in their final duel,</v>

192
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.483
<v Speaker 1>they both passed their own preferred </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons to each other instead of either </v>

193
00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:40.370
<v Speaker 1>taking the advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for spike,</v>

194
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 1>his decision to kill vicious isn't about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him being a serious piece of shit.</v>

195
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.403
<v Speaker 1>In part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about writing a personal wrong </v>

196
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Julia's death as French reminds us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero of a western is not the cowboy </v>

197
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:53.204
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of the caped crusader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wrongs must always relate to some </v>

198
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.094
<v Speaker 1>harm suffered either by him directly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>by someone with whom he has established </v>

199
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.324
<v Speaker 1>a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a more philosophical </v>

200
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 1>reason behind spikes decision and it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with skepticism.</v>

201
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.643
<v Speaker 1>Since leaving the syndicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spike has wondered if he ever really </v>

202
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.330
<v Speaker 1>survived at all wondering if what he saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>was real cuddle.</v>

203
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.193
<v Speaker 1>No real</v>

204
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 1>did you call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have Christmas Day cutoff.</v>

205
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] called the hold on medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>call me day.</v>

206
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Many me fucking I came to Janae </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically.</v>

207
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.543
<v Speaker 1>Spike continually floats the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything he sees could just be a </v>

208
00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] emailed me.</v>

209
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.253
<v Speaker 1>In this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spike echoes the skepticism of ancient </v>

210
00:12:44.391 --> 00:12:45.224
<v Speaker 1>Chinese philosopher lungs up who roped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time I [inaudible] was a </v>

211
00:12:50.331 --> 00:12:54.080
<v Speaker 1>butterfly fluttering hither and thither.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To all intents and purposes,</v>

212
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.973
<v Speaker 1>a butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was conscious only of my happiness as </v>

213
00:12:57.231 --> 00:12:59.900
<v Speaker 1>a butterfly on aware that I was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

214
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Soon I awake and there I was there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bleed myself again.</v>

215
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:04.963
<v Speaker 1>Now I do not know whether I was then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man dreaming I was a butterfly or </v>

216
00:13:08.151 --> 00:13:08.984
<v Speaker 1>whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am a man spike struggling to make sense </v>

217
00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:14.054
<v Speaker 1>of life before and after the syndicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonders if maybe he never really left </v>

218
00:13:17.091 --> 00:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>the syndicate at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wonders if he really died that night.</v>

219
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.403
<v Speaker 1>It's only after losing the love of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that he accepts the cruel reality </v>

220
00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:27.500
<v Speaker 1>of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been awake the whole time.</v>

221
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it's anybody can submit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for spike.</v>

222
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.060
<v Speaker 1>His dead man's walk isn't just to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge on vicious.</v>

223
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 1>It's paradoxically to show himself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's awake or as he tells Fay shitty new</v>

224
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.403
<v Speaker 1>coworkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nay.</v>

225
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

226
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Putting a halt on each to Ricardo car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while it's up for debate,</v>

227
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:54.810
<v Speaker 1>whether spike dies after his final fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>with vicious,</v>

228
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spike would make clint eastwood proud by</v>

229
00:13:57.751 --> 00:13:59.820
<v Speaker 1>storming vicious his hideout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

230
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.713
<v Speaker 1>And wondering why vicious and spike and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go at it with the Katana and a pistol </v>

231
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and the whole fight still feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>believable.</v>

232
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because Ronin films,</v>

233
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese period pieces that followed the</v>

234
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.033
<v Speaker 1>loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samurai dispensing personal justice are </v>

235
00:14:12.511 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the cultural equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westerns.</v>

236
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.500
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the epic one,</v>

237
00:14:16.501 --> 00:14:17.334
<v Speaker 1>men armies to the tent silence before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dual westerns in Ronan's have </v>

238
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:23.070
<v Speaker 1>created a fairly shared visual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thematic identity.</v>

239
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But that's another video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

240
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.303
<v Speaker 1>the third and perhaps most notable genre</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboy bebop works in is no are </v>

241
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.570
<v Speaker 1>strangely no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our is notoriously hard for film critics</v>

242
00:14:33.571 --> 00:14:35.070
<v Speaker 1>to define.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

243
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Board and Etienne show Matam </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined it in their seminal text,</v>

244
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.893
<v Speaker 1>a panorama of American film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war as having five feet </v>

245
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:44.400
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamlike,</v>

246
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.080
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>erotic,</v>

247
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.940
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cruel,</v>

248
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.710
<v Speaker 1>but many popular noir.</v>

249
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.543
<v Speaker 1>Our films don't hit all the marks while </v>
<v Speaker 1>every character is influenced by film </v>

250
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:55.360
<v Speaker 1>noir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy.</v>

251
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's telling me it's the book.</v>

252
00:14:58.251 --> 00:14:59.084
<v Speaker 1>Can you come by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the genre has the greatest pool </v>

253
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 1>on Faye and jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

254
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Spike thing is clearly a femme fatale </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

255
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 1>a film noirs favorite conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See one film,</v>

256
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:11.054
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our first captured the popular </v>

257
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:12.734
<v Speaker 1>imagination following World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were few representations of women </v>

258
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>that depicted them as anything other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than swooning,</v>

259
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>fainting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking pairs of ovaries.</v>

260
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>But as literary scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie place notes,</v>

261
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.133
<v Speaker 1>no war changed that and became one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the few periods of film in which women </v>

262
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>are active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not static.</v>

263
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:34.511
<v Speaker 1>Symbols are intelligent and powerful if </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructively so and derive power,</v>

264
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>not weakness from their sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They is definitely intelligent,</v>

265
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:40.484
<v Speaker 1>powerful in sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's constantly one step ahead of her </v>

266
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:43.694
<v Speaker 1>male peers.</v>

267
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you took on a [inaudible] [inaudible] na</v>

268
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.880
<v Speaker 4>gene Kolkata dinner</v>

269
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and she isn't above using her sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get what she wants.</v>

270
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.303
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

271
00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.563
<v Speaker 1>And whilst some like critic Julie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grossman have criticized the trope for </v>

272
00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:19.680
<v Speaker 1>being an overly simplistic reduction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady agency in the world,</v>

273
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Faye is a little more dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

274
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.663
<v Speaker 1>she's the only character who really </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us substantive and channel change </v>

275
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.000
<v Speaker 1>by the series end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her narrative arc also taps into the</v>

276
00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:33.420
<v Speaker 1>very philosophical spine of know are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>

277
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nihilism has become wise cracks.</v>

278
00:16:36.481 --> 00:16:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Favorite dead horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

279
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't put it in the Zeitgeists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to literary critic Mark Conrad</v>

280
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.523
<v Speaker 1>Nawar Develop as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century ushering out old belief </v>

281
00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:47.874
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Nisha famously proclaimed God is </v>

282
00:16:49.921 --> 00:16:50.754
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was making a statement that these </v>

283
00:16:52.141 --> 00:16:56.460
<v Speaker 1>seeming like a turtle systems like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality or even truth,</v>

284
00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.930
<v Speaker 1>we're illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality to Nisha is in constant flux,</v>

285
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.600
<v Speaker 1>which means things like definitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constants,</v>

286
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.650
<v Speaker 1>and even being don't exist over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he was right or wrong,</v>

287
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Nisha was correct in predicting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>

288
00:17:09.751 --> 00:17:13.620
<v Speaker 1>alienation and loneliness brought on by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the disillusionment of these systems.</v>

289
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.490
<v Speaker 1>As science chipped away at our happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems in the 20th century,</v>

290
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.150
<v Speaker 1>people became lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An anxious and wise crack was born.</v>

291
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing the war as a response or reaction</v>

292
00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:28.530
<v Speaker 1>to the death of God helps explain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonality of the elements that critics</v>

293
00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:31.440
<v Speaker 1>have noted in new our films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inherent pessimism,</v>

294
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.393
<v Speaker 1>alienation and disorientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's one character who's </v>

295
00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:40.020
<v Speaker 1>continually had belief system after </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system ripped away from her,</v>

296
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.210
<v Speaker 1>it's Fay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When fay first awakes,</v>

297
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.640
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't actually believe that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

298
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.850
<v Speaker 1>That is until your lawyer's teller that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got it all wrong.</v>

299
00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 1>And you sent him book cause you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting</v>

301
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And if waking up in an unrecognizable </v>
<v Speaker 1>future sounds bad,</v>

302
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.270
<v Speaker 1>try adding trust issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Faye finds out that her old lawyer,</v>

303
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you know the one she fell in love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>had faked his death,</v>

304
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.343
<v Speaker 1>you can bet your bottom dollar that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt the same lonely anxiety that Nisha </v>

305
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.233
<v Speaker 1>had described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of whom today [inaudible] and Faye </v>

306
00:18:13.641 --> 00:18:14.474
<v Speaker 1>experiences the ultimate disillusionment</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she finds out that the goal she's </v>

307
00:18:17.451 --> 00:18:18.284
<v Speaker 1>been searching for her past is gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Ed takes page of the place where </v>

308
00:18:21.771 --> 00:18:22.604
<v Speaker 1>she grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two are greeted by an old classmate </v>

<v Speaker 1>she can never get her old life back.</v>

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.820
<v Speaker 1>so we've got a former cop turned pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bounty hunter who's pining over a</v>

<v Speaker 1>The time moves forward and with it </v>

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.180
<v Speaker 1>everyone else consider the pocket.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I [inaudible] I said it though.</v>

337
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolism might be a bit heavy </v>

338
00:20:24.831 --> 00:20:25.664
<v Speaker 1>handed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jet Holding onto the broken watch </v>

339
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:27.854
<v Speaker 1>represents his desire to return to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past to a time when his watch still tit </v>

340
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.130
<v Speaker 1>and Elisa waited for him to come home </v>
<v Speaker 1>from work.</v>

341
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.650
<v Speaker 1>But when jet seeks answers about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

342
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.480
<v Speaker 1>he's reminded that it's long gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elisa has a new life and a new boyfriend</v>

343
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.463

<v Speaker 1>Worse when a lease a finally gives jet </v>

344
00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 1>the answers he's looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shatter his ideas of the past.</v>

345
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.313
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jets relationship wasn't so perfect and </v>

346
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Elisa felt trapped.</v>

347
00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 4>That's what he eats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what that does,</v>

348
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 4>the three to tookie he's jacking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

349
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.783
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet can't return to his past because </v>

350
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 1>this idealized past never existed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

351
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Looking back at that interstitial about </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing without fear of risky things,</v>

352
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>breaking traditional styles and creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>new genres,</v>

353
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.343
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to argue that series director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she needs zero Watanabe didn't do just </v>

354
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 1>that in cowboy bebop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saifai westerns.</v>

355
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are even a little Ronan action.</v>

356
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 1>It's all here and it's all excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this very genre bending that's made</v>

357
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:40.504
<v Speaker 1>the series so popular and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why cowboy bebop seems so fresh </v>

358
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:44.404
<v Speaker 1>two decades later and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the story that can withstand the </v>

359
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>test of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Cowboy Bebop,</v>
