1
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>The more recent finding is this pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

2
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where were we?</v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:15.934
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a study where we had people come </v>

4
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>into the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>to take a battery of risk taking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making measures on a computer.</v>

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.143
<v Speaker 1>And we asked him to come and bring two </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with them and then we randomly </v>

7
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>assigned them to either do these tasks </v>
<v Speaker 1>by themselves,</v>

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to do it with their friends,</v>

9
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and we had teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>college undergraduate sent adults,</v>

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 or so years old.</v>

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.463
<v Speaker 1>And so what we found in this study was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the mere presence of peers doubled </v>

13
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>the number of risks that adolescents </v>
<v Speaker 1>took.</v>

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.603
<v Speaker 1>It had a 50% increase among college </v>
<v Speaker 1>students and no effect at all among </v>

15
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was really interesting to me.</v>

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had shown this experimentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.763
<v Speaker 1>Let's consistent with the idea that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent risk taking occurs when </v>

19
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>they're in groups and with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

20
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just recently,</v>

21
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleague Jason [inaudible],</v>

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.273
<v Speaker 1>who is a neuroscientist and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently took this experiment into the </v>

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Ri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have this subjects,</v>

24
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their brains being scanned.</v>

25
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And they're lying down in the magnet at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer screen is in there that can</v>

26
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>do the tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same task.</v>

27
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>We haven't come with two friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends are in the next room.</v>

28
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Their friends can see their performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a monitor that's in the next room and</v>

29
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>their friends are miked into the magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

30
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on cue when we tell the friends,</v>

31
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay Dave,</v>

32
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

33
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we compare people's performance on </v>

34
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:39.944
<v Speaker 1>these tasks when they know their friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>are watching them and when they know </v>

35
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:43.214
<v Speaker 1>their friends can't see them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not even in the same room </v>

36
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just are aware of their presence.</v>

37
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not encouraging them to take </v>

38
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>risks or anything like that cause we </v>
<v Speaker 1>script what they're allowed to say.</v>

39
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And we've just discovered in the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of writing this up right now to send out</v>

40
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:56.174
<v Speaker 1>to the journal that the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peers activates the brain systems that </v>

41
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>are in this reward circuit that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about in kids.</v>

42
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.933
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't in adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we think that the reason that we </v>

43
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:18.101
<v Speaker 1>saw the pure fact is that when you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your friends,</v>

44
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:19.034
<v Speaker 1>when you were a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increases the salience of the </v>

45
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:22.514
<v Speaker 1>rewarding aspects of a risky decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then of course there's going to </v>

46
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>make you pursued the risky decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than be risk averse.</v>

47
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>So we're really excited about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding.</v>

48
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

49
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

50
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.953
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just working on a paper this </v>

51
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>morning in which we looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.643
<v Speaker 1>the impact of the presence of friends on</v>
<v Speaker 1>People's preferences for immediate </v>

53
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>versus delayed rewards.</v>

54
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And we were just doing this in the skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>are now,</v>

55
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our behavioral research,</v>

56
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.233
<v Speaker 1>we see the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a sample of 19 year olds and </v>

57
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.350
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do this task,</v>

58
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:58.184
<v Speaker 1>it's called the delay discounting task </v>
<v Speaker 1>where basically measures how much you'd </v>

59
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:01.534
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much less of a reward you'd be </v>

60
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>willing to take to get it now rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than waiting.</v>

61
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>when the 19 year olds do this with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends watching them,</v>

63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they make decisions that are comparable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what 14 year olds make.</v>

64
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when 19 year olds do it with their </v>

65
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not watching them,</v>

66
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>they behave like adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

67
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>it's this impact of peers on reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing that seems to be going on,</v>

68
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>that may play a role in understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk taking.</v>

69
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:30.530
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we first saw it,</v>

71
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.951
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

72
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you asked what gets me excited?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>when we first saw these brain scans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't believe it because it looked</v>

74
00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>too beautiful to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we peaked,</v>

75
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of early on,</v>

76
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>we'd only run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>a couple dozen subjects and now we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done the whole experiment.</v>

78
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing.</v>

80
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

81
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it has held up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're really,</v>

82
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>really jazzed about this.</v>
