00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack real life.</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.064
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you got used to only rick and </v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:07.464
<v Speaker 1>morty quick takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest show on earth just </v>

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>wrapped its seventh season and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some amazing moments.</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>The Jamie Tyrian Reunion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible battles,</v>

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.093
<v Speaker 1>lady [inaudible] Lennon's death scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aria murdering the phrase the Zombie </v>

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Dragon going ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of awesome stuff.</v>

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>But to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our humble opinion,</v>

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>the show just doesn't feel as a magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And of course we had to ask ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.433
<v Speaker 1>Game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by virtue of adapting George Rr Martin </v>

12
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.143
<v Speaker 1>is revolutionary series got us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked by refusing to play by the rules </v>

13
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>of the fantasy genre or even normal tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took turns.</v>

14
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.204
<v Speaker 1>We never saw coming killed characters we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were sure would be around for the end </v>

15
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>game and turn the tropes of the fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>genre inside out.</v>

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.393
<v Speaker 1>It was that willingness to show the ugly</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the Lords and ladies that made </v>

17
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:54.564
<v Speaker 1>us fall in love.</v>

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>These days it's feeling a little eagles </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue the boys from Mount Doom.</v>

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.413
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because game of thrones set </v>

20
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>up the unique specific rules for its </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

21
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Made promises about what we could expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not expect.</v>

22
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And now that it's time to pay off those </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>well it just feels like a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

24
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>dineros and friends have lost their edge</v>

25
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>in today's quick take on game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 1>season seven and as always,</v>

26
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead before we can explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with theme of thrones,</v>

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk about story structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>react structure to be specific.</v>

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Even if you've never heard that phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it in action because almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>every story in the world follows it.</v>

30
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.153
<v Speaker 1>Without getting too much into detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can describe three x structure like </v>

31
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.484
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Act one the major players in central </v>

32
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>conflicts are introduced in act two </v>
<v Speaker 1>events complicate those conflicts.</v>

33
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And finally in act three of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts are resolved.</v>

34
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>These categories are used to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of a story.</v>

35
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>So while they may seem like arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutoff points,</v>

36
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>they are indicative of patterns we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>in almost every story.</v>

37
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>So let's take that basic structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apply it to game of thrones.</v>

38
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Act One is the first two seasons we meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lannisters.</v>

39
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>The starks Denaris and the whole gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learned about the iron throne and how</v>

40
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.733
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even see the white walkers the first </v>

41
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>that culminates with each side taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions and making their moves.</v>

42
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Act Two is the war itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the costs.</v>

43
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Rob As the red wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan is burning his daughter,</v>

44
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>joffrey getting poisoned all with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>undead threat looming in the background.</v>

45
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>These days we're firmly enact three John</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Danny are preparing to face off with</v>

46
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.034
<v Speaker 1>the white walkers.</v>

47
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>While CRC is going crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to hang onto her new found power.</v>

48
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.713
<v Speaker 1>The show pretty much nailed acts one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>two not only did they establish </v>

49
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:37.494
<v Speaker 1>characters in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did so in a creative way that </v>

50
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:40.614
<v Speaker 1>challenged our expectations after season</v>
<v Speaker 1>one who really thought we'd all grow a </v>

51
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:45.534
<v Speaker 1>soft spot for Jamie lannister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is all these twists and turns </v>

52
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>set us up to expect an ending that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the same unpredictable pattern.</v>

53
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Sounds weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

54
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.063
<v Speaker 1>but that's what made it so great and </v>
<v Speaker 1>season seven that's turning into a bit </v>

55
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>of a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how it happened.</v>

56
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>The show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May Two major promises early on.</v>

57
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a dedication to breaking down the</v>

58
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness of the fantasy world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not all gowns and gallantry.</v>

59
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it showed us the dark underbelly and </v>

60
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>cruelty that infects every inch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westerns.</v>

61
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>The nights aren't paragons of justice.</v>

62
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>They're rapists and murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beautiful prince isn't kind.</v>

63
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.813
<v Speaker 1>He's a spoiled monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honor doesn't help you reach new </v>

64
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts you in jail.</v>

65
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.913
<v Speaker 1>Magic isn't something friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It involves sacrifices and shadow </v>

66
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:33.574
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good guys who fight for justice </v>

67
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>don't always win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

68
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>they usually die because everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>is playing dirty.</v>

69
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.613
<v Speaker 1>The landslide Gwen of your style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forbidden love between a knight and his </v>

70
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Queen in Game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incest.</v>

71
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.463
<v Speaker 1>This is the show that killed robb stark </v>
<v Speaker 1>who would be the hero in any other </v>

72
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>fantasy story at his uncle's Dang </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding,</v>

73
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.483
<v Speaker 1>a double subversions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since rob was living out the narrative </v>

74
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.424
<v Speaker 1>of love overcoming all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only it did the lannisters cutoff Ned's </v>

75
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 1>head because he was too loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shoved a kid out a window for </v>

76
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:05.824
<v Speaker 1>seeing something he shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These moments were more than just cool </v>

77
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.454
<v Speaker 1>Vitsa TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were signals that game of thrones </v>

78
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>was not business as usual.</v>

79
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>That brings us to the second major </v>
<v Speaker 1>promise.</v>

80
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>The show promised us that actions would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have consequences.</v>

81
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.403
<v Speaker 1>We see this in episode one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man shirks is nightwatch duties and </v>

82
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>ned decapitating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no questions asked.</v>

83
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.393
<v Speaker 1>That's the world of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing comes without a cost and even </v>

84
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>the greatest victories can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications.</v>

85
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.304
<v Speaker 1>The characters never expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a storytelling value at play </v>

86
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that everything matters.</v>

87
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.633
<v Speaker 1>That's why this is the show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched a million conspiracy theories </v>

88
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>for several seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consequences where the law of the land,</v>

89
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.013
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is no one mad at Cersi for blowing </v>

90
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>up the CEP and killing Marjorie Tyrrell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone we know was hugely popular.</v>

91
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Do they just not know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because they're mad at CRC or</v>

92
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:58.324
<v Speaker 1>afraid of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these folks seem like they're doing </v>

93
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.694
<v Speaker 1>just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can also see this and how the show </v>

94
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>handles travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These days.</v>

95
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>The logistics push the limits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausibility.</v>

96
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dendri turns into Usain Bolt and sends a</v>

97
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 1>raven at a speed far greater than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unladen swallow,</v>

98
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.493
<v Speaker 1>which crosses Westeros a continent </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as the size of South America </v>

99
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.383
<v Speaker 1>to Generis who flies her dragon's back </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the continent all before the </v>

100
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>magnificent seven can even get frost in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their beards.</v>

101
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.343
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that fast travel strains </v>

102
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>credulity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actively harms the dramatic action of</v>

103
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>the show when travel stops being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

104
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.803
<v Speaker 1>So does the danger of traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One huge element of the travel times in </v>

105
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.094
<v Speaker 1>thrones Burley storytelling is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implication that something could go </v>

106
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>wrong on any trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bandon,</v>

107
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Stoneman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavers,</v>

108
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.143
<v Speaker 1>whatever that risk means that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a huge number of possible </v>

109
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fast travel world,</v>

110
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>that's not really on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that nuance,</v>

111
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:55.174
<v Speaker 1>the repercussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that anything can happen any </v>

112
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>moment is now gone.</v>

113
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It got traded for expedited plotting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:03.524
<v Speaker 1>it's a trade that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were only 13 episodes left when </v>

115
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>the season started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's changed.</v>

116
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:09.644
<v Speaker 1>The nature of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game of thrones was so interesting for </v>

117
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.614
<v Speaker 1>the first five seasons in change because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was decidedly not your daddy's </v>

118
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>fantasy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

119
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>this is something that any parent could </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize.</v>

120
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.493
<v Speaker 1>All the tired and familiar tropes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones was deconstructing are </v>

121
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:30.071
<v Speaker 1>back in full force on ambiguous evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec on killable chosen ones.</v>

122
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Check Dsx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mokena rescues and check,</v>

123
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

124
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a show heading in new </v>
<v Speaker 1>different directions.</v>

125
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a show that is checking third </v>
<v Speaker 1>act boxes.</v>

126
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.853
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's checking them in a way that </v>

127
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:46.364
<v Speaker 1>defies the narrative framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spent five years internalizing even </v>

128
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the finale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty dang good,</v>

129
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>showed off all these problems.</v>

130
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>As the season came to a close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got clear sides,</v>

131
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>something game of thrones has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>reluctant to offer us.</v>

132
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Now all the characters we like are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>one side.</v>

133
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for ethical ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is this happening?</v>

134
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to that three act </v>

135
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.314
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of years of storytelling </v>

136
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>indicate that to create a satisfying </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

137
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>the show needs to have all the work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danny,</v>

138
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>John and others have put into change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world actually pay off.</v>

139
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.623
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how all fantasy stories and the </v>

140
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>good guys always win against incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>odds.</v>

141
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>The subversion doesn't work anymore when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to the end game.</v>

142
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.343
<v Speaker 1>Even the craziest brand is the night </v>
<v Speaker 1>king type ending doesn't really subvert </v>

143
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:34.964
<v Speaker 1>anything and ending where this was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable because of magic or time </v>

144
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:38.944
<v Speaker 1>travel undermines the theme of agency in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show and it's just another fantasy </v>

145
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>trope for the show to fall back on.</v>

146
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.163
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems the show can't get to the </v>

147
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:47.774
<v Speaker 1>ending it wants while still disrupting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fantasy narrative space from the </v>

148
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:52.574
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game of thrones has told us that we're </v>

149
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>getting a different kind of fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

150
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.283
<v Speaker 1>but this past season it felt more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings than the Sopranos and </v>

151
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>honestly it's a bit disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the end of the day,</v>

152
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:05.054
<v Speaker 1>it's still a good show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an action fantasy story and </v>

153
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that's not what they promised us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching guys piece.</v>
