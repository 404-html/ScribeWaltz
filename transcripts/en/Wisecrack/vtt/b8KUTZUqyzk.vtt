1
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared again.</v>

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>little town in Colorado.</v>

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park for the past three seasons.</v>

4
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:11.294
<v Speaker 1>The show's ditched at signature </v>
<v Speaker 1>standalone episodes and embrace season </v>

5
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>long serialization and it's largely been</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.373
<v Speaker 1>Season 19 brilliantly blended themes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pc culture advertising and </v>

7
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:22.874
<v Speaker 1>gentrification over a multi episode arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most recently season 20 kicked off </v>

8
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>with an even more ambitious storyline </v>
<v Speaker 1>that juggled the presidential election,</v>

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>member berries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a militant feminist Hartman,</v>

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>a girl hating Dick flashing butters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a whole lot of internet trolling.</v>

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>It all seem to be leading up to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>epic conclusion.</v>

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>And then everything just fizzles out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into confusion convolution and only they</v>

13
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.234
<v Speaker 1>just blew up the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why did season 20 leave us feeling </v>

14
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:50.894
<v Speaker 1>all itchy and uncertain like a fourth </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade school wide outbreak of Lice had </v>

15
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>just surface?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:56.174
<v Speaker 1>we have an idea and it all has to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Matt and trey secret sauce that </v>

17
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>makes South Park's writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack condition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park.</v>

19
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Season 20 what went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

20
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.573
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching south park feels like peering </v>

21
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>inside the mind of the world's funniest </v>
<v Speaker 1>stoner.</v>

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>It's unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative,</v>

23
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>and completely unhinged in the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

24
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But make no mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strict order to the madness.</v>

25
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>The show is constructed with one rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>plotline rule.</v>

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.033
<v Speaker 2>We found out this really simple rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe you guys have all heard </v>

27
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can take these beats,</v>

28
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:35.181
<v Speaker 2>which are basically the beats of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>outline and if the words and then belong</v>

29
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 2>between those beats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

30
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.543
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a three plot storyline about </v>

31
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:40.854
<v Speaker 1>stick figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John John Adopts a stray dog and then </v>

32
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>John wins the lottery and then John </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a scientologists.</v>

33
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>John's story has a sucky narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no cause and effect.</v>

34
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.623
<v Speaker 1>You could rearrange each action into any</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and it would remain a random </v>

35
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>series of events in the life of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery winning dog,</v>

36
00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:58.734
<v Speaker 1>rescuing intro level scientologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what makes good southpark approved </v>

37
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>writing and whenever you can replace </v>
<v Speaker 1>your andwith,</v>

38
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>buts or therefores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes for better,</v>

39
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.453
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take South Park's famous Mormon episode </v>

40
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>to town.</v>

41
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Therefore heat pisses everyone off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore stand decides to kick his ass,</v>

42
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>but the kid is so nice that he tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>

43
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

44
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.604
<v Speaker 1>Stan doesn't beat him up and said he </v>
<v Speaker 1>agrees to go to the kid's house for </v>

45
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:27.174
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice how each action that begins with </v>

46
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>therefore or but indicates a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reaction to the previous action.</v>

47
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.613
<v Speaker 1>Every pot point matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why the show never loses </v>

48
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

49
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:38.934
<v Speaker 1>so that's south park's golden rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we dive into what went wrong </v>

50
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>with season 20 it's time to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the orange tinted elephant in the room.</v>

51
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president of the United States stone</v>

52
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>in Parker had been upfront about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that like 99% of the pollsters,</v>

53
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>they expected Turd Sandwich to win the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election and plan the series around that</v>

54
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.923
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to do desperate minute read </v>

55
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>rights in order to Aaron episode the day</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the election,</v>

56
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>so not ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as giant Douche,</v>

57
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrison wins the election,</v>

58
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.733
<v Speaker 1>the show starts breaking the creator's </v>
<v Speaker 1>core rules and getting them all put Dab </v>

59
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>as seen in the two main plotlines member</v>
<v Speaker 1>berries and trolling.</v>

60
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.363
<v Speaker 1>Let's map out the member berries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plotline randy tries member barry's </v>

61
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>false into eight and install jic </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend things.</v>

62
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Get a little dark room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran excel model not full times.</v>

63
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.203
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy realizes member berries are </v>

64
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brainwashing germs with the what's going</v>

65
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>on with these member berries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

66
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrison along with his vp,</v>

67
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:38.374
<v Speaker 1>Caitlyn Jenner is leading in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he realizes he doesn't have a plan </v>

68
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>to carry out his campaign promises and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll look like a jackass if he wins.</v>

69
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>What the hell do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I win,</v>

70
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to do what I promised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

71
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.693
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrison spends the first half of the </v>

72
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>series trying to sabotage his campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>so hillary will win.</v>

73
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to come clean.</v>

74
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea I would get this far,</v>

75
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the matter is I should </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be president,</v>

76
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but his voters catch on and demand an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

77
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy tells garrison the truth about his</v>

78
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.390
<v Speaker 1>popularity.</v>

79
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>When the world is changing so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes us yearn for the old ways.</v>

80
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.713
<v Speaker 1>When life seemed simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean those old ideas are </v>

81
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>good for us now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

82
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the two of them set out to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>member berries,</v>

83
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but quickly realized that these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys just won't die.</v>

84
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.863
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy convinces Mr Carish to give a </v>

85
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.504
<v Speaker 1>heartfelt speech denouncing nostalgia on</v>
<v Speaker 1>November 8th you must vote against me </v>

86
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>and show the world that you didn't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new star wars was all that good.</v>

87
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect half season set up.</v>

88
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Ray Hilary victory that follows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden rule of southpark storytelling.</v>

89
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Except newsflash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilary lost.</v>

90
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly they have to justify garrison </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising when and that's when things </v>

91
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>get messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

92
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:02.014
<v Speaker 1>south park has to improvise it's way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the rest of the season and the </v>

93
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>writers start to break their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling rules.</v>

94
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>We go from a strictly but or therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>based plot,</v>

95
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big cluster of and bed starting with.</v>

96
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And then Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrison winds anyway out of nowhere.</v>

97
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And then Kaitlin Barfs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinfecting,</v>

98
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrison and randy with member berries.</v>

99
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So Randy and garrison trip out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stall.</v>

100
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.174
<v Speaker 1>Jah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget their quest to destroy member </v>

101
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>berries and generally get stoked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>garrison's victory.</v>

102
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>This presses the rewind button on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plot,</v>

103
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>watching them unlearn the perils of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>storage.</v>

104
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It is literally narrative back pedaling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

105
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:38.194
<v Speaker 1>you have this nagging feeling that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should take more than a bit of Berry </v>

106
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.004
<v Speaker 1>flavored nostalgia to explain garrison </v>
<v Speaker 1>split second transformation from </v>

107
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:46.084
<v Speaker 1>terrified self sabotaging presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate to the cocky leader of the </v>

108
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>free world there today on there whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair?</v>

109
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From here,</v>

110
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the member barry storyline just </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally gets muddled.</v>

111
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.453
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of the season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a clear purpose to set up a </v>

112
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.424
<v Speaker 1>physical embodiment of the toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia that will eventually be </v>

113
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>overcome like the human adds in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier season.</v>

114
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.113
<v Speaker 1>They start out as lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicating berries and then they </v>

115
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:14.984
<v Speaker 1>magically turned into a weird vomit </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing virus and then they stop by at </v>

116
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>1920s nightclub in a brief side story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems quickly forgotten and then we</v>

117
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 1>find out they're Nazis.</v>

118
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Mama Stan Jubril's not nurse to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>

119
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Real old lines people line a maybe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>got our men being</v>

120
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.133
<v Speaker 1>also pals with Vladimir Putin and by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end they're ultimately looking like a </v>

121
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 1>tiny fruit militia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

122
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:43.900
<v Speaker 1>the show doesn't offer any justification</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the member berries transformation.</v>

123
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.853
<v Speaker 1>Instead we get a random progression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>events that build without any apparent </v>

124
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>logic and that's just not the south park</v>
<v Speaker 1>emo.</v>

125
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.913
<v Speaker 1>Now onto another sub plot that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangled up by a trump win trolling for </v>

126
00:06:57.671 --> 00:06:58.504
<v Speaker 1>most of the season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We watched Kyle's Dad Gerald living his </v>

127
00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:01.414
<v Speaker 1>best life as the wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh trolls skank hunt 42 this initially </v>

128
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:07.720
<v Speaker 1>conforms with the South Park philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of story structure.</v>

129
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.673
<v Speaker 1>Gerald's trolling angers the Danes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore the Danes threatened to </v>

130
00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:12.034
<v Speaker 1>release everyone's Internet history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending Gerald Cartman South Park and </v>

131
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:15.844
<v Speaker 1>the world into a panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter Hillary Clinton who's confidence </v>

132
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.433
<v Speaker 1>she's about to win the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she finds out trolled trace might </v>

133
00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:22.894
<v Speaker 1>leak her online activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore she needs who is gang hunt 42 </v>

134
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>we believe he's the only one who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>save you then crap.</v>

135
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.323
<v Speaker 1>She loses the election and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrative structure starts to </v>

136
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>crumble without her presidency to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend.</v>

137
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Clinton doesn't have any real reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruit Gerald's slash skank hunt 42 and</v>

138
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>then confusingly Clinton recruits him </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway with a vague mission.</v>

139
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>He needs to infiltrate troll trace to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect US secrets.</v>

140
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>We want to send someone into Denmark </v>
<v Speaker 1>undercover and steal their technology.</v>

141
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.500
<v Speaker 1>This entire scene of Hillary meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerald below the bridge feel super weird</v>

142
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.334
<v Speaker 1>and disjointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like it's from an alternate </v>

143
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:05.824
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because it probably was recycled </v>

144
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:08.644
<v Speaker 1>material from the original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Hillary had one version of the </v>

145
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:11.824
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly what fit the south park </v>

146
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.423
<v Speaker 1>role of storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A newly elected hillary is afraid of </v>

147
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.150
<v Speaker 1>having compromising emails released by </v>
<v Speaker 1>troll trace.</v>

148
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.043
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she recruits Gerald to take down the </v>

149
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:22.384
<v Speaker 1>dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerald wants to stop troll trace from </v>

150
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:26.500
<v Speaker 1>revealing his secret identity anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

151
00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:30.460
<v Speaker 1>he agrees to go and delete the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and save both of them from exposure.</v>

152
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.500
<v Speaker 1>But in this strange new president </v>
<v Speaker 1>garrison run world that can't fly.</v>

153
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So in a desperate attempt to salvage the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plotline,</v>

154
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.213
<v Speaker 1>the show reveals that Clinton's claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>was merely a ruse and she's actually </v>

155
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 1>just helping the Danes kidnap American </v>
<v Speaker 1>trolls in exchange for the protection of</v>

156
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>her email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then oops,</v>

157
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.013
<v Speaker 1>turns out they're just trolling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American trolls they capture and then </v>

158
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>this top Danish guy wasn't trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish the trolls.</v>

159
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.173
<v Speaker 1>He's also just a giant troll trolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world for the loans and also he's </v>

160
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>not even in Danish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did your brain just melt?</v>

161
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.053
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably because South Park </v>

162
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>abandoned its most basic narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise.</v>

163
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.793
<v Speaker 1>None of the events in the trolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative actually build off previous </v>

164
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just a seemingly random,</v>

165
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 1>increasingly complicated laundry list of</v>
<v Speaker 1>plot points.</v>

166
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.463
<v Speaker 1>The show writers openly complained about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrative hold they dug for </v>

167
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.600
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

168
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.370
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is South Park.</v>

169
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.750
<v Speaker 4>What's happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You less?</v>

170
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.800
<v Speaker 4>We used to have a challenging deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

171
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.953
<v Speaker 4>They move onto the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we've just been dealing with </v>

172
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:34.324
<v Speaker 4>trolling of Internet stuff over and over</v>
<v Speaker 4>week after week and I don't know about </v>

173
00:09:36.731 --> 00:09:38.080
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I get pretty sick of it.</v>

174
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It almost feels like the Danish guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcement that he's just trolling the</v>

175
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>world is a last ditch effort to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrative.</v>

176
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is like the new post funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>era of satire.</v>

177
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.033
<v Speaker 1>Just like Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrison when he's drunk on member </v>

178
00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:51.164
<v Speaker 1>berries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely nihilistic troll doesn't </v>

179
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:54.710
<v Speaker 1>need plot consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>

180
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:57.650
<v Speaker 1>the writers need to wrap up a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>incompletes storylines,</v>

181
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.513
<v Speaker 1>most notably the risks cartman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerald face from having their internet </v>

182
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>history reveal so they commit plot Hari </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cari,</v>

183
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>by blowing everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

184
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.663
<v Speaker 1>Everybody from Kyle's little brother Ike</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top generals at the Pentagon </v>

185
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.953
<v Speaker 1>collaborate to take down the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a massive blitz of trolling and a </v>

186
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:18.200
<v Speaker 1>little help from Elon Musk space x </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

187
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>By blowing up the internet and deleting </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's ugly a secrets,</v>

188
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.963
<v Speaker 1>they also destroy the cause and effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that isn't building up all </v>

189
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:30.740
<v Speaker 1>season instead of a satisfying </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion where things get resolved,</v>

190
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.780
<v Speaker 1>audiences just get a big old psych.</v>

191
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.940
<v Speaker 1>We're blowing everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

192
00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:35.774
<v Speaker 1>the season had done such a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing the way the Internet has </v>

193
00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>fragmented our public and private </v>
<v Speaker 1>selves.</v>

194
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.403
<v Speaker 1>How this sense of privacy has given us </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ability to behave like assholes </v>

195
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>without the people we love ever having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out.</v>

196
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Speaker 1>This was all building up to a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>promising conclusion,</v>

197
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.933
<v Speaker 1>but we never got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show also brilliantly skewers the </v>

198
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.623
<v Speaker 1>outrage cycles that dominate Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture as trolls expertly push our </v>

199
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:00.794
<v Speaker 1>buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of simmering outrage actually </v>

200
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:05.750
<v Speaker 1>seems like a more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for Mr Garrison's victory.</v>

201
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:06.584
<v Speaker 1>Then member berries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show never develops this idea aside </v>

202
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.830
<v Speaker 1>from giving it one quick shout out </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the finale tribers axiom,</v>

203
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.980
<v Speaker 1>trevor's axiom is a well known equation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in online trolling.</v>

204
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:16.843
<v Speaker 1>It's a way in which one person can </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a massive reaction on the </v>

205
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Internet all bringing up the worst in </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

206
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.163
<v Speaker 1>That sort of sounds like how I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected because Matt and Trey Thought </v>

207
00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:26.534
<v Speaker 1>Hillary would win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spent the first half of the season </v>

208
00:11:28.161 --> 00:11:31.130
<v Speaker 1>teasing the perils of having your </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet history exposed,</v>

209
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.023
<v Speaker 1>but since trump won hillary's emails </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposing her are no longer as relevant </v>

210
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:38.210
<v Speaker 1>as say the outrage cycles on social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

211
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.253
<v Speaker 1>So what might season 20 of south park </v>
<v Speaker 1>have looked like in a parallel universe </v>

212
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.560
<v Speaker 1>where the Turd sandwich triumphs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't you seen the polls?</v>

213
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.663
<v Speaker 1>It's president elect senators or </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to a deadline interview with </v>

214
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:50.234
<v Speaker 1>stone and Parker viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a sneak peek in the postelection </v>

215
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.613
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton and bill cosby joined </v>

216
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>forces to announce their new South Park </v>
<v Speaker 1>is gentleman's club and obvious hangover</v>

217
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:00.514
<v Speaker 1>from me if Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one version of the episode later Bill </v>

218
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Confides in butters that the club was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a place for men to hide because</v>

219
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 5>trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my wife is a crazy bitch.</v>

220
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.173
<v Speaker 5>She and all the other women in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>are about to get payback and we are all </v>

221
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 5>completely,</v>

222
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.673
<v Speaker 1>Parker says that in the alternate </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality season 20 they would have </v>

223
00:12:24.051 --> 00:12:24.884
<v Speaker 1>focused on bill settling into his new </v>
<v Speaker 1>role as the apparently terrified first </v>

224
00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:29.174
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen of the u s it would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fitting way to escalate the battle of </v>

225
00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:34.700
<v Speaker 1>the sexes already underway at South Park</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elementary.</v>

226
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.540
<v Speaker 1>It also would have given a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing seat to Carmen's newly inspired</v>

227
00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:42.200
<v Speaker 1>fear of his girlfriend Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who he suspects is trying to destroy him</v>

228
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.213
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>
