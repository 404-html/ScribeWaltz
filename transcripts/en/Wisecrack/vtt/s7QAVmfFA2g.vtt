1
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack,</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw coco last week,</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>every one cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once we got past that God awful</v>

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>frozen short film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all good tears.</v>

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Coco is a film filled with color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both literally and in it's authentically</v>

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.584
<v Speaker 1>rich portrayal of Mexican culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but aside from the heartstring tugging </v>

7
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.454
<v Speaker 1>moments and gorgeous animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also presents a really interesting </v>

8
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>perspective on death that we don't often</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in cinema.</v>

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Will come this quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take on cocoa and prepare for major </v>

10
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>spoilers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

11
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.584
<v Speaker 1>warning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put your all the Mexican </v>

12
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Gringo Sumi first or recap seven.</v>

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.773
<v Speaker 1>Mexico young Miguel Rivera loves music </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wants to play guitar like his hero </v>

14
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>or nested dela Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but music is banned in the Rivera family</v>

15
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.154
<v Speaker 1>since his great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grandpa left his family to pursue </v>

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>a career in music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After Miguel steals dela Cruz,</v>

17
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:50.004
<v Speaker 1>his guitar on Dia de Los Muertos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's transported to the realm of the </v>

18
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

19
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.933
<v Speaker 1>Believing dela Cruz is his great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grandfather Miguel ventures to </v>

20
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>find him in hopes of receiving his </v>
<v Speaker 1>blessing to return to the living world.</v>

21
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Getting to this mega celeb is a hell of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a challenge,</v>

22
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:03.804
<v Speaker 1>but luckily his new pal hector agrees to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help him in exchange for putting up </v>

23
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.464
<v Speaker 1>Hector's photo on his family's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of a shrine with pictures of </v>

24
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.353
<v Speaker 1>our dancestors so he's not forgotten and</v>
<v Speaker 1>is able to visit the land of the living </v>

25
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.114
<v Speaker 1>to see his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff happens and it turns out that </v>

26
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Miguel's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grandfather is not Ernesto,</v>

27
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.663
<v Speaker 1>but hector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's beloved daughter is Miguel's </v>

28
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grandmother,</v>

29
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Coco dela Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered hector stole his songs,</v>

30
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:27.414
<v Speaker 1>his guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately his chance to be </v>

31
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>remembered by his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miguel returns to the land of the living</v>

32
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.143
<v Speaker 1>sparks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coco's memory of her father by singing </v>

33
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.543
<v Speaker 1>protectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture on the agenda and they all live </v>

34
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.363
<v Speaker 1>or die happily ever after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as evidenced by the number of hipster </v>

35
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>sugar skull tattoos I see in Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

36
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.293
<v Speaker 1>Many Americans are fascinated by dia de </v>
<v Speaker 1>los muertos and Coco isn't the first </v>

37
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>animated film that makes use of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting.</v>

38
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.163
<v Speaker 1>In 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twentieth Century Fox put out a movie </v>

39
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>called the book of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also features a boy who was shoes.</v>

40
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:57.714
<v Speaker 1>Family tradition to pursue music is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transported to the land of the dead on </v>

41
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:00.954
<v Speaker 1>Dia de los Muertos and requires the help</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his ancestors to return to the world </v>

42
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.824
<v Speaker 1>of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though these films feature similar </v>

43
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:07.224
<v Speaker 1>plots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't be more different and </v>

44
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.294
<v Speaker 1>their portrayal of debt in the book of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Life Minolos dead ancestors basically </v>

45
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:13.524
<v Speaker 1>exist only to assist in his journey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give the producers and excuse to cast </v>

46
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>ice cube in your story that is presented</v>
<v Speaker 1>as something static once your dad.</v>

47
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're remembered by your family,</v>

48
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you get to party and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten,</v>

49
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you're a sad sack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way you're dead.</v>

50
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.003
<v Speaker 1>Coco elevates this concept by </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing a second kind of death </v>

51
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.424
<v Speaker 1>beyond the biological be symbolic death </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being forgotten once there's no one </v>

52
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.764
<v Speaker 1>alive who remembers you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you disappeared from the land of the </v>

53
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passing away a second time.</v>

54
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.893
<v Speaker 1>That second death is brought on solely </v>
<v Speaker 1>through relationships to others in </v>

55
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:52.794
<v Speaker 1>cocoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's People's memories that mark the </v>

56
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.864
<v Speaker 1>difference between life and debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and interesting way to think about this </v>

57
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>is through the lens of philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Beaudry,</v>

58
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>who talks about death as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social relation,</v>

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.633
<v Speaker 1>the Western cultural understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death has been filtered through science </v>

60
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>to the point where we now think of death</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a primarily biological phenomenon.</v>

61
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Once your heart stops and your fingers </v>
<v Speaker 1>start rotting,</v>

62
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.833
<v Speaker 1>your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boatyard compares this to certain non </v>

63
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.654
<v Speaker 1>Western cultures in which death has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic relation of exchange with the </v>

64
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>living in these cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only his death,</v>

65
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>something both given and received by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

66
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>but the dead can give and receive as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

67
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.743
<v Speaker 1>Cocoa Explores this system of mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange between the living and the </v>

68
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.194
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miguel needs the help of his relatives </v>

69
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>to return to the land of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they need his help as well.</v>

70
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.563
<v Speaker 1>Hector makes a deal with Miguel to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>his photo to the a friend that in </v>

71
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>exchange for his assistance in getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and on Dia de los Muertos,</v>

72
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>the other living characters interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their ancestors.</v>

73
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.593
<v Speaker 1>Despite not being able to see them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat the grave sites bring offerings and </v>

74
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>authentically honor those who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>

75
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.073
<v Speaker 1>It's only the exchange that occurs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dia de los Muertos that prevents the </v>

76
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.404
<v Speaker 1>dead from experiencing the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly way more terrifying death that </v>

77
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>happens when you're no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered.</v>

78
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.793
<v Speaker 1>Boatyard says that in most western </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies that kind of two way exchange </v>

79
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>between the living and the dead doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

80
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.813
<v Speaker 1>The dead aren't a group that the living </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with and the more society is </v>

81
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:13.804
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less of a role dead people play </v>

82
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.643
<v Speaker 1>among the dead people we do remember we </v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on money and on posters and </v>

83
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.184
<v Speaker 1>learned about them in history class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't think of it in terms of a </v>

84
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

85
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't expect anything from the dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't offer them anything either.</v>

86
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Even the idea of this sounds pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>

87
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>but this removal of the dead from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interactions changes the shape of</v>

88
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Boatyard says,</v>

89
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>when the dead don't interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

90
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.323
<v Speaker 1>they become obliterated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this obliteration in Coco when </v>

91
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.674
<v Speaker 1>individuals stop existing once they no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer have living relatives to </v>

92
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:47.974
<v Speaker 1>participate in that exchange of </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembrance and celebration and Care </v>

93
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.941
<v Speaker 1>Church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own,</v>

94
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:52.774
<v Speaker 1>the only person we witness experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that second death doesn't leave a body </v>

95
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>behind the way he certainly did in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological dad.</v>

96
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.183
<v Speaker 1>His skeleton fades and all that slept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Defendant is a guitar and a bunch of </v>

97
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>junk in a Hammock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while memory might be enough to save</v>

98
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:06.964
<v Speaker 1>the dead from permanent extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suffer when they aren't able to </v>

99
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>return to the living and interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their family.</v>

100
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Just had a really hard the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could we be using them equal right now?</v>

101
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.043
<v Speaker 1>Memory matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the living have to be willing to </v>

102
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>give something more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Baudrillard.</v>

103
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:21.994
<v Speaker 1>This give and take between life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death would mean that dying and being </v>

104
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.684
<v Speaker 1>born are not necessarily opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're part of this big system of </v>

105
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:29.974
<v Speaker 1>exchange as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and death can be traded for live via </v>

106
00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:33.464
<v Speaker 1>social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and although he's not talking about </v>

107
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Coco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we wish he was,</v>

108
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.193
<v Speaker 1>hector's shift from being forgotten to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being celebrated among his descendants </v>

109
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.973
<v Speaker 1>is in a sense a kind of rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he hadn't quite crumbled into </v>

110
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>dust yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's at risk of being obliterated.</v>

111
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:48.694
<v Speaker 1>The moment coco forgets him and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spark of her memory brings him back to </v>

112
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though biologically he's still dead</v>

113
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>as a doornail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Coco herself eventually dies,</v>

114
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>she's reunited with her parents in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>land of the dead.</v>

115
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.053
<v Speaker 1>She's their child again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though she looks about twice their </v>

116
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.564
<v Speaker 1>age combined with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she makes her journey back to the land </v>

117
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:08.654
<v Speaker 1>and living for their yearly visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fruitful exchange of Dia de los </v>

118
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.373
<v Speaker 1>Muertos still involves cocoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now from the other side of your </v>

119
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.613
<v Speaker 1>friend up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a reason that people cry when </v>

120
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Miguel sings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember me at the end of the film.</v>

121
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a moment of connection between Coco</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her long gone father,</v>

122
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a command to all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to forget the dead.</v>

123
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>The performance of the song brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic life back to hector,</v>

124
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.453
<v Speaker 1>but the words of the song itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the importance of life beyond </v>

125
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.684
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a kids movie that's pretty damn </v>

126
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although coming from Pixar,</v>

127
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.334
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't expect anything less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coco gives us all the good stuff's </v>

128
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>sweeping musical scores and shots so </v>
<v Speaker 1>colorful.</v>

129
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like shooting up a box of Crayola </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

130
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.123
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes us think is true death</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your heart stops beating or when </v>

131
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:53.534
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you in people's memories is the mark </v>

132
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you leave on the world.</v>
