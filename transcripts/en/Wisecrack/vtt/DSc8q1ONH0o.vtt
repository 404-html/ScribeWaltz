00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.413
<v Speaker 1>Full disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video was made possible by the </v>

4
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>people over at for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been fans of the Mondo show,</v>

5
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:13.964
<v Speaker 1>happy tree friends for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when verve reached out to us and </v>

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>asked us to check out the new Mondo </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

7
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Gary and his demons streaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusively on verb.</v>

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>We were pretty excited and five episodes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

9
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:24.764
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't help but notice a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities to to otherwise crack </v>

10
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.334
<v Speaker 1>favorites archer and this show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've mentioned maybe once or twice </v>

11
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:32.624
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't hate one particular moment stood </v>

12
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>out to us as particularly zeitgeisty.</v>

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to murdering people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say.</v>

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say here.</v>

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I was going to say.</v>

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

17
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not your whole personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His hooks,</v>

18
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's other things you can say.</v>

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

20
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Which reminded us of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

21
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>would you give it a rest?</v>

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had something to this and this.</v>

23
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I guess I did the Butler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.043
<v Speaker 2>Does that scan?</v>

25
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>This subversion of hero one liners got </v>
<v Speaker 1>us thinking,</v>

26
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>why is this kind of humor so prevalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days?</v>

27
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.773
<v Speaker 1>Is there something more going on here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that says something about our modern </v>

28
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>social condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as we watched more,</v>

29
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>we realized that was just the tip of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>iceberg,</v>

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>so if you haven't seen Gary and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>demons yet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>One thing we've noticed lately is a </v>

34
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.474
<v Speaker 1>particular trend in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjecting the fantastic to the mundane </v>

<v Speaker 2>HR,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Suck Guy Suck.</v>

57
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Why does this comedy works so well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why now?</v>

58
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Or at least for adult cartoon viewers </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of 18 and 34.</v>

59
00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.453
<v Speaker 1>Well to overly dramatic one could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because our dreams are dead still </v>

60
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

61
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.173
<v Speaker 1>Because to understand why we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to dive into the philosophy of </v>

62
00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:11.684
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a few major theories of humor </v>

63
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:14.414
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one that popped up only a few </v>

64
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.563
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago is incongruent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the idea that humor arises </v>

65
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:23.900
<v Speaker 1>from the discrepancy between our </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations and reality.</v>

66
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a punchline,</v>

67
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>if not the subversion of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation?</v>

68
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Remember we used to smoke pot and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about how one day maybe we could be</v>

69
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>on Conan together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

70
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 3>that was yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

71
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.020
<v Speaker 1>there's one philosopher who takes this </v>
<v Speaker 1>further,</v>

72
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.033
<v Speaker 1>arguing that humor arises from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] between our notion of </v>

73
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:41.574
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as humans and the subversion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that notion by the mechanical nature </v>

74
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 1>of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While this theory is a bit antiquated,</v>

75
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>we can use it to help us understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>

76
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.263
<v Speaker 1>Today in 1900 philosopher Henri Bergson </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorized that the source of humor was </v>

77
00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:56.394
<v Speaker 1>the mechanical encrusted upon the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing during the industrial </v>

78
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bergson said,</v>

79
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:01.764
<v Speaker 1>when we laugh because someone falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily their misfortune </v>

80
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:05.454
<v Speaker 1>that we find funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the spectacle of a machine </v>

81
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>malfunctioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

82
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.950
<v Speaker 1>our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

83
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.873
<v Speaker 1>take the classic prank of pulling a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair out from under a friend about to </v>

84
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fall on their ass.</v>

85
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Hilarity ensues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Bergson,</v>

86
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:20.304
<v Speaker 1>we laughed because an action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as routine as sitting down is basically </v>

87
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:24.384
<v Speaker 1>the body on autopilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that habitual emotion fail is </v>

88
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.823
<v Speaker 1>what generates the lows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while this kind of falling on your </v>

89
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>ass humor certainly predates machines.</v>

90
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.763
<v Speaker 1>We can still think of it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical rigidity against human </v>

91
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:38.784
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably no coincidence that </v>

92
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Bergson was writing when factories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines reshaped modern life.</v>

93
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.713
<v Speaker 1>More than 30 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Chaplin would in some ways </v>

94
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.313
<v Speaker 1>embody elements of Bergson's theory in </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern times where the intrusion of </v>

95
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>mechanization onto the human is put </v>
<v Speaker 1>front and center.</v>

96
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.053
<v Speaker 1>If modern times was so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it because he struck a nerve with </v>

97
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 1>people's relationship to machines for </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaplain?</v>

98
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that humans are acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like machines,</v>

99
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.383
<v Speaker 1>but have also become entangled in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society of machines which brings us to </v>

100
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:10.854
<v Speaker 1>modern day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We no longer feel our sense of self </v>

101
00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:13.524
<v Speaker 1>threatened by physical machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another kind of machine you see </v>

102
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Bergson's formulation has evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humor isn't just the machine and crusted</v>

103
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>upon the human society and crusted upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human,</v>

104
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>the component parts of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and corporate bureaucracy,</v>

105
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 1>cultural expectations all act like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of machine.</v>

106
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 1>One that happens to simultaneously feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>us dreams and tear them away from us.</v>

107
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 1>The discrepancy between our fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helped us cope with reality and the</v>

108
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>reality that forsakes those dreams is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new engine of humor.</v>

109
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.044
<v Speaker 1>In 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary and his demons imagines a chosen </v>

110
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:53.940
<v Speaker 1>demon hunter as a sad sack working stiff</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can't even retire.</v>

111
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I realized why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the time it's of my job sucks</v>

112
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>and my life</v>

113
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.100
<v Speaker 2>sucks more than anyone else's and that's</v>

114
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.310
<v Speaker 1>navel gazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the truth.</v>

115
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Demons have to face being in or out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion trends</v>

116
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.483
<v Speaker 2>that hot new mirror monster running his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth about how the old guard is out of </v>

117
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.063
<v Speaker 2>touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bloody Mary dates back to the 15 </v>

118
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.893
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>

119
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>mira monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in archer.</v>

120
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.083
<v Speaker 1>Even the exciting world of espionage </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't take your mind off your flex </v>

121
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

122
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I got to spend the balance of my God </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn flex account</v>

123
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>and while Rick may be the only one above</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all,</v>

124
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not bogged down by expense </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports and bureaucracy net bureaucrats.</v>

125
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.443
<v Speaker 1>I don't respect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep shooting morning his arch </v>

126
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:38.234
<v Speaker 1>nemesis or a bunch of himself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce other versions of himself to </v>

127
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.774
<v Speaker 1>factory workers and students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole joke of simple rick is </v>

128
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:45.884
<v Speaker 1>revealing the real nature of escapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy as just another cog in the </v>

129
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>soulless machine come home to the unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor of shattering the grand illusion.</v>

130
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Come home to simple rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just these three shows.</v>

131
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.683
<v Speaker 1>This kind of humor is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good place imagines an afterlife </v>

132
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>full of legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitration and Algorithms.</v>

133
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.613
<v Speaker 1>When your time on earth has ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we calculate the total value of your </v>

134
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:11.204
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying are perfectly accurate </v>

135
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>measuring system only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people with the very highest scores,</v>

136
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 1>the true cream of the crop got to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>here to the good price.</v>

137
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.523
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man imagined super heroing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dumb bureaucratic game mired in red </v>

138
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>tape and the sleeper hit soon to be TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show what we do in the shadows envisions</v>

139
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>frightening vampires fighting over banal</v>
<v Speaker 1>roommate issues.</v>

140
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Vampires don't do dishes to return to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berkson.</v>

141
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
<v Speaker 1>If we find all this funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because we're confronted with a </v>

142
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:40.544
<v Speaker 1>mirror of our own lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than just laughing at bodies as </v>

143
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:43.994
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we laugh when we imagine people as mere </v>

144
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.813
<v Speaker 1>instruments have a greater machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bergson gives the example of a person </v>

145
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>who performs their duty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a human,</v>

146
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.473
<v Speaker 1>but like a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cites a story he found in a </v>

147
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:56.054
<v Speaker 1>newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A large steamer was wrecked off the </v>

148
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>coast of France after courageously </v>
<v Speaker 1>rushing to save the passengers.</v>

149
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 1>The customs officers didn't ask if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivors were okay,</v>

150
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>but rather immediately asked if they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to declare.</v>

151
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 1>The customs officers were not acting as </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

152
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but mere instruments have a larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy,</v>

153
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>and this is exactly what shows like </v>
<v Speaker 1>archer Gary and his demons and sometimes</v>

154
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty rely on how we've become </v>
<v Speaker 1>near instruments have a larger game.</v>

155
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 2>We know how you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working.</v>

156
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Our assembly line is justice.</v>

157
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.843
<v Speaker 1>It puts on display the inclusivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the way we imagine the world </v>

158
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>ought to be and the way it really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this discrepancy.</v>

159
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:36.764
<v Speaker 1>We no longer live in a world where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can stomach the cheery idealism of </v>

160
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:40.604
<v Speaker 1>heroes past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have to deconstruct the fantasy at </v>

161
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>every turn because our fantasies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been deconstructed.</v>

162
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.173
<v Speaker 1>We can't imagine much of anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>without wanting to think of what is </v>

163
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>pulling its strings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take these superhero one liner,</v>

164
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 1>one say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>source of Catharsis.</v>

165
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.323
<v Speaker 1>If it got motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it now needs to be exposed as a tired </v>

166
00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:00.050
<v Speaker 1>cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we get this</v>

167
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.720
<v Speaker 4>table for one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Want to try?</v>

168
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Want to try one more time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

169
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.830
<v Speaker 4>this guy's cut off</v>

170
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.353
<v Speaker 1>beause you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should know that as an original and </v>

171
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:12.354
<v Speaker 1>this Gillette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be ready with the transdermal </v>

172
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>solution of the most powerful laxative </v>
<v Speaker 1>known to man.</v>

173
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had something for this.</v>

174
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.853
<v Speaker 1>Marvel movies can't sell superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>without constantly undercutting the </v>

175
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>seriousness of what they're doing.</v>

176
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.020
<v Speaker 4>We know other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a friend from work</v>

177
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.383
<v Speaker 1>pools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most popular superheroes by </v>

178
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:32.664
<v Speaker 1>virtue of not being a hero at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things like cinema since draw humor </v>

179
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>from subjecting films to a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

180
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>hard logic that they weren't even built </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

181
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 1>This leads us to the second marker of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern humor,</v>

182
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>a broken protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this certainly isn't new.</v>

183
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.203
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Seinfeld did it over 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of looking up to burt </v>

184
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:51.954
<v Speaker 1>reynolds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now admire a broken version of burt </v>

185
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 1>reynolds or a broken van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helsing or a broken doc brown.</v>

186
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>And then there's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always sunny in Philadelphia,</v>

187
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.313
<v Speaker 1>a show that according to create or Glenn</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howerton shows what the American dream </v>

188
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 1>looks like when you fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the notion of doing good deeds,</v>

189
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.023
<v Speaker 1>his shadow on relishing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collateral damage that often comes with </v>

190
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:12.984
<v Speaker 1>being a quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good guy are demon hunter amputates an </v>

191
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.344
<v Speaker 1>orphan by accident and tries to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer person before realizing it's </v>

192
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:20.604
<v Speaker 1>pointless.</v>

193
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 2>You came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I knew you cared about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are a good guy.</v>

195
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.963
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morty tries to save an interdimensional </v>

196
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.394
<v Speaker 1>being from assassination only to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover it wants to exterminate all </v>

197
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.204
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carbon based life is a threat tool I </v>

198
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.913
<v Speaker 1>allies to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are what you would call a disease </v>

199
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.933
<v Speaker 1>and has to kill it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick highlights the futility of do </v>

200
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.114
<v Speaker 1>gooding when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the reality where Hitler </v>

201
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 1>cured cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morty,</v>

202
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.833
<v Speaker 1>the answer is don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the entire premise of archer is to </v>

203
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:49.194
<v Speaker 1>explore these self obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>eccentricities of the people who are </v>

204
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:56.721
<v Speaker 1>supposed to keep us safe at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To summarize,</v>

205
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.200
<v Speaker 1>we were promised jet packs and hover </v>
<v Speaker 1>boards.</v>

206
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>And because we never got them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no fantasies,</v>

207
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.313
<v Speaker 1>no heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some serious skepticism about doing </v>

208
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:07.704
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the best sense of pleasure we </v>

209
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>can get is collectively reflecting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense of disappointment.</v>

210
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.763
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not to say we're completely </v>

211
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:15.294
<v Speaker 1>without dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of dreaming of Nicer cars and </v>

212
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>the perfect relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shirt definitely still happens.</v>

213
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.030
<v Speaker 1>We also get gratification by relishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the utterly mundane.</v>

214
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather get embroiled in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly nasty Ponzi scheme or go on</v>

215
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:33.320
<v Speaker 2>a date with trevor from school?</v>

216
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Things like the Roy game or this are </v>
<v Speaker 1>barely even science fiction.</v>

217
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.460
<v Speaker 1>She's obsessed with her new virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>bouncer game.</v>

218
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Real fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You on the list?</v>

219
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Nice tripe house to the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

220
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.383
<v Speaker 1>Is it any different than the wildly </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular job simulator game where one </v>

221
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>pretends to be a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly reenacting mundane office work or</v>

222
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>clicker games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is everything hopeless?</v>

223
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.613
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes we wise crackers can sometimes seem </v>

224
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>like curmudgeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

225
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

226
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I promise there's still hope like my</v>

227
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:07.170
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you look at?</v>

228
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Dead baby phase muffin man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

229
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.743
<v Speaker 1>or for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to this place that took my two </v>

230
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 1>favorite sauces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hummus and garlic sauce,</v>

231
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>and turned it into one sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pretty much shattered my worldview.</v>

232
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.863
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you fixate on the hopelessness </v>

233
