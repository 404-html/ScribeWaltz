1
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.043
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the launch of the first </v>

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack pilot for 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a couple of them in the works.</v>

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.193
<v Speaker 1>We will work really hard on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly we want to know </v>

4
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:15.254
<v Speaker 1>what you guys think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let us know what you think in the </v>

5
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>comments and enjoy the show.</v>

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's the details of a film </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter most likely a single shot,</v>

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.323
<v Speaker 2>a needle drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a little line of dialogue is </v>

8
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:32.894
<v Speaker 2>looking at your kid a sudden cut what </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like insignificant choices often </v>

9
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 2>say more in under 20 seconds than other </v>
<v Speaker 2>films say into ours.</v>

10
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.423
<v Speaker 2>In this new format,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be studying these seemingly </v>

11
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:45.914
<v Speaker 2>trivial pieces revealing how even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smallest elements can bring layers of </v>

12
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 2>meaning to a piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to wise cracks the film,</v>

13
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the wolf of Wall Street</v>

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 3>and sell me this pen,</v>

15
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 2>the closing shot of the wolf of Wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>Street.</v>

16
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 2>This pen works and I just used simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>push in and crane up.</v>

17
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I told you this shot changes the</v>

18
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:19.501
<v Speaker 2>meaning of the entire film?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This pen works and I personally,</v>

19
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.583
<v Speaker 2>as a client describes the pin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is voice drowns out and solemn music </v>

20
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 2>kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up to this point,</v>

21
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 2>the film is utilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poppy,</v>

22
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 2>upbeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits to underscore the debauchery,</v>

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 4>the amnesia phase,</v>

24
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 2>so why the sudden shift to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>more serious and meditative.</v>

25
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 2>For most of its three hour run time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolf of Wall Street revels in Jordan</v>

26
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Belfort's access his yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his women,</v>

27
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 2>his drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his parties,</v>

28
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 2>the lifestyle paid for by defrauding </v>
<v Speaker 2>investors.</v>

29
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.273
<v Speaker 2>That is until the FBI circles in seizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belfort's cash and sending them away to </v>

30
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:04.584
<v Speaker 2>prison for four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unlike similar films where the </v>

31
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 2>corrupt Wall Street broker gets locked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and justice is served,</v>

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.023
<v Speaker 2>the wolf of Wall Street is absent any </v>
<v Speaker 2>overt moralizing Belford prison time is </v>

33
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 2>a cakewalk and he doesn't even serve his</v>
<v Speaker 2>full sentence.</v>

34
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing has changed.</v>

35
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Belfort to still selling and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

36
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>they're still buying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is just the tip of the iceberg.</v>

37
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 2>The final shot can be interpreted in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of ways,</v>

38
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 2>but here are our three favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

39
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 2>the final shot holds up a mirror to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie goers.</v>

40
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:38.184
<v Speaker 2>Viewing the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice there's eight backlight behind </v>

41
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>the seminar that evokes a projector </v>
<v Speaker 2>shining on the back of an audience.</v>

42
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 2>So what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

43
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 2>it may be easy to lay the blame solely </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Jordan for all the moral depravity,</v>

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.003
<v Speaker 4>wolf of Wall Street,</v>

45
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the final shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blame not only on Belford,</v>

46
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>but on us and the culture that allows </v>
<v Speaker 2>and encourages his behavior.</v>

47
00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>He divorced me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

48
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.330
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Early on,</v>

49
00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Belford says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we person you're on the phone with,</v>

50
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.010
<v Speaker 2>they want to get rich and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get rich quickly.</v>

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.043
<v Speaker 2>They don't want something familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We may feel dignified because we're not </v>

52
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.903
<v Speaker 2>crawling on the ground on quileutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but truth is Jordan scam wouldn't work </v>

53
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't share his dream of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich quickly,</v>

54
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.630
<v Speaker 2>wanting something or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y'all want to be just like him.</v>

55
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.793
<v Speaker 2>Scorsese is essentially calling us out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've just spent three hours partying </v>

56
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.250
<v Speaker 2>with laughing and reveling in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts.</v>

57
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.743
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder Jordan doesn't suffer any</v>
<v Speaker 2>punishments in the end because after </v>

58
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:48.170
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we revel in everything he does.</v>

59
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Living vicariously through him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wishing that we could live his life too.</v>

60
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.323
<v Speaker 2>To all these people staring intently at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one person hanging on his every word </v>

61
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 2>remind you of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go there.</v>

62
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Scorsese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a devout Catholic,</v>

63
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.340
<v Speaker 2>has spent much of his career exploring </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith in his films,</v>

64
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.593
<v Speaker 2>yet in the wolf of Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters worship at the altar of </v>

65
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.240
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money</v>

66
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 2>the camera holds on these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each one and focus so we can see they're</v>

67
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 2>painfully average faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desperate plain looking.</v>

68
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:29.484
<v Speaker 2>People looking for meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desiring that which can elevate them </v>

69
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 2>above their mundane existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iscore,</v>

70
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Scorsese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cynically likening,</v>

71
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 2>be transformative power of faith to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative power of money,</v>

72
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.480
<v Speaker 2>except the Almighty never promised a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million bucks in eight easy steps.</v>

73
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.613
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one if by solidly portraying a crowd </v>

74
00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:52.200
<v Speaker 2>that warships Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite his detestable actions,</v>

75
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.303
<v Speaker 2>scorsese suggests something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>sinister that we actually like being </v>

76
00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 2>taken advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>French philosophers,</v>

77
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:01.834
<v Speaker 2>John Francois Leotard famously said as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much the English unemployed did not </v>

78
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:10.431
<v Speaker 2>become workers to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They enjoyed the hysterical masochistic,</v>

79
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever exhaustion it was hanging on in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minds,</v>

80
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 2>in the foundries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the factories in hell.</v>

81
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.393
<v Speaker 2>They enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed the mad destruction of their </v>

82
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:22.524
<v Speaker 2>organic bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decomposition of their personal </v>

83
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:28.070
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are lower than pond scum,</v>

84
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.810
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed the disillusion of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>families and villages,</v>

85
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.883
<v Speaker 2>and enjoyed the new monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anonymity of the suburbs in the pubs in </v>

86
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:39.000
<v Speaker 2>the morning and evening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So could this closing image indicate the</v>

87
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:39.834
<v Speaker 2>voluntary submission of the masses who </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only don't mind white collar </v>

88
00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:44.504
<v Speaker 2>criminals stealing their money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but find a perverse enjoyment in their </v>

89
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 2>banal existence under the heel of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Belfort's of the world.</v>

90
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 2>This one single shot is emblematic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just how complex the wolf of Wall Street</v>

91
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 2>is as a true totem of our culture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>access.</v>

92
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>The film defies easy answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This format is a bit of a test for us,</v>

93
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 2>so let us know what you think in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments and as always,</v>

94
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching peace.</v>

95
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 1>So hope you guys enjoyed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a whole bunch of pilots on the</v>

96
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>slate this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just one of them.</v>

97
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>We've got another one coming out in </v>

<v Speaker 1>so be sure to be on the lookout for </v>

100
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.750

103
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.574
<v Speaker 1>our love for movies to the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we wanted to leave you guys a little </v>

104
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes on how it was that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>put this thing together and the big crew</v>

105
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>that it took to make this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

106
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>So enjoy the behind the scenes and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what the next one and about a month.</v>

107
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Thanks guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

108
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>what's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on the set of project.</v>

109
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing something I would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear,</v>

110
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's for the shoot is behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes,</v>

111
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>so hope you guys enjoy.</v>

112
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.890
<v Speaker 1>We're doing this very interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

113
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 1>We're working on the shining through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared and I were brainstorming on how we</v>

114
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>can come up with something that had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more production value,</v>

115
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To take the idea of a video essay,</v>

116
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.583
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about a theme </v>
