<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlings </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is guardians of the</v>

3
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Galaxy Vol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two starring sexy Labrador retriever,</v>

4
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Chris Pratt and directed by a certified </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthlings cinema Super Fan,</v>

5
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.494
<v Speaker 1>James Gunn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We open on an unsolicited music video </v>

6
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>for electric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light Orchestra is Mr Blue Sky,</v>

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but shortly thereafter the movie begins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The space of Andrew's are added again.</v>

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.293
<v Speaker 1>Only this time they're on autopilot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're rolling in that squeak </v>

9
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>well money rocket steals a bunch of car </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries from a nearby mitis store,</v>

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>so the midas employees launch a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale attack with their drone army.</v>

11
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at giant hard boiled egg comes along and</v>

12
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>saves our heroes without even cracking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shell.</v>

13
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>The captain of the egg introduces </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as Eggo.</v>

14
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Peter quills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long lost father and a healthy part of a</v>

15
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>balanced breakfast invites everyone back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his home planet for some extra syrup,</v>

16
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.283
<v Speaker 1>but just the humanoid characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freaks have to stay behind in case </v>

17
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>someone shows up to kidnap them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which thankfully someone does.</v>

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.843
<v Speaker 1>It's Yon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a minor bad guy from the first one </v>

19
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:14.814
<v Speaker 1>here to confuse everybody by snagging </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary emotional arc of the second </v>

20
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he captures rocket,</v>

21
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.243
<v Speaker 1>but almost immediately his crew mutinies</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fear of getting their trash cans </v>

22
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>knocked over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the crew doesn't account for his baby</v>

23
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>groot coming to the rescue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaudevillian slapstick.</v>

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggo reveals that he and his home planet</v>

25
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:33.444
<v Speaker 1>are actually one and the same and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's some kind of godlike celestial </v>

26
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>being a super ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.913
<v Speaker 1>He explained that he took his Kurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell form in order to travel the </v>

28
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>universe and find meaning in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I either get laid,</v>

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.813
<v Speaker 1>he does not explain why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A being who has been around for </v>

30
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:50.394
<v Speaker 1>Millennia and projects is on appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would bother to age himself up after </v>

31
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>only 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

32
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>echo shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter,</v>

33
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:58.974
<v Speaker 1>that he has celestial powers to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the power to have a catch and </v>

34
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:04.794
<v Speaker 1>the power to overanalyze earth media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of earth's greatest musical </v>

35
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>compositions.</v>

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's very greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

37
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>As if anyone had any interest in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately Eggo,</v>

38
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.943
<v Speaker 1>then let slip that he planted seeds on </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of planets in order to take </v>

39
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.084
<v Speaker 1>them over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one celestial isn't enough to </v>

40
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>activate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needs to celestial's.</v>

41
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Why not just do it himself and only </v>
<v Speaker 1>activate half the planets?</v>

42
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>You asked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

43
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.403
<v Speaker 1>Peter starts going through his </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellious phase and stands up to his </v>

44
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>mean old dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon.</v>

45
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 1>All the other space avengers join in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fund and rock.</v>

46
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>It makes a bomb using those batteries </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning.</v>

47
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.343
<v Speaker 1>Full circle baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They burn to a crisp and yon do </v>

48
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices himself to prove some point </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

49
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.183
<v Speaker 1>Then there's just enough time for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie to set the Guinness Beer record </v>

50
00:02:55.771 --> 00:03:00.771
<v Speaker 1>for most post credit scene guardians of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy volume two as an Ode to daddy</v>

51
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.644
<v Speaker 1>issues and all their various forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the form that leads to lower </v>

52
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>back tattoos.</v>

53
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

54
00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:12.671
<v Speaker 1>I have issues per Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sigman Floyd,</v>

55
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweight champion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis.</v>

56
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.203
<v Speaker 1>The childhood need for a father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>protection plays a crucial role in </v>

57
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>shaping the human psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the shape of that psyche ends up</v>

58
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>being a primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a morphous Blob,</v>

59
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.833
<v Speaker 1>Peter has spent his whole life yearning </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the father who abandoned him with </v>

60
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than an ab roller at a tub </v>
<v Speaker 1>of protein powder,</v>

61
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah and nebulous father thanos </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced them to fight each other,</v>

62
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>destroying the family bond as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>nebulous skin to metal ratio.</v>

63
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.443
<v Speaker 1>Every time my sister prevailed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father would replace a piece of </v>

64
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.613
<v Speaker 1>machinery rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never even had any parents to begin </v>

65
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.404
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be why he never learned to </v>

66
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>shave.</v>

67
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I know them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists.</v>

68
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>What made you never gave a rat's ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>about serious?</v>

69
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.660
<v Speaker 2>My own damn parents who saw me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faith in the slavery,</v>

70
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.560
<v Speaker 2>a character</v>

71
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.393
<v Speaker 1>attempt to overcome their respective </v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy issues by turning into helio </v>

72
00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.350
<v Speaker 1>copter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents of their collective child,</v>

73
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.243
<v Speaker 1>baby groot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need to have a real </v>

74
00:04:10.281 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 1>discussion about your language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we meet ego,</v>

75
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.783
<v Speaker 1>he's draped in long lost father tropes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the cliche game of catch to having </v>

76
00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:18.494
<v Speaker 1>a beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we soon learned that Eggos </v>

77
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.533
<v Speaker 1>motivations are less about fatherhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more about taking over the known </v>

78
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:24.464
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not how most father showed </v>

79
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.060
<v Speaker 1>their love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karen's Dad,</v>

80
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 1>this is a radical inflation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethicists,</v>

81
00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>henry the Henry Nader Sedgwick's concept</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ethical egoism,</v>

82
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.643
<v Speaker 1>which states that one ought to act only </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of self interest in order to </v>

83
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:40.214
<v Speaker 1>maximize their own pleasure eggos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self absorption is so crest complete </v>

84
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that all other life pales in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you how all those years ago I had</v>

85
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:54.191
<v Speaker 1>an unceasing impulse to find life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I did not tell you,</v>

86
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 1>this is how when I finally did find it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was also disappointing.</v>

87
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and me both bow.</v>

88
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.233
<v Speaker 1>The antithesis to Eggos philosophy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>altruism didn't realize your motivation </v>

89
00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:06.824
<v Speaker 1>was altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A term invented by French philosopher </v>

90
00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Auguste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Henry Nader comped that suggests man</v>

91
00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>has a moral obligation to live for </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

92
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.470
<v Speaker 1>One need look no further than the name </v>
<v Speaker 1>guardians of the galaxy vol.</v>

93
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to detect this idea as the word guardian</v>

94
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:22.034
<v Speaker 1>implies a duty to protect others and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall to implies a cynical view of the </v>

95
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:26.534
<v Speaker 1>movie going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public Echo tries to inflate Peter's </v>

96
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've heard tell about the man they call</v>

97
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 1>star Lord and tempt him with weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry.</v>

98
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Death will remain a stranger to both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us as long as the light burns within the</v>

99
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:40.760
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Guardian's vanquish Eggo instead</v>

100
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>proving once and for all that altruism </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphs over selfishness well twice and</v>

101
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.294
<v Speaker 1>for all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since they pretty much did the same </v>

102
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:51.020
<v Speaker 1>thing at the end of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one for earthlink cinema,</v>
