<v Speaker 1>that beast.</v>

54
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>So they grew up and head down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sewers.</v>

55
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Thing is Harry and his posse creeping up</v>
<v Speaker 1>from behind,</v>

56
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.163
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't long before it goes cold to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry's boys and Henry gets lost for </v>

57
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.073
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to record it with an inhaler and </v>

58
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.324
<v Speaker 1>some choice words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The losers roll up on edge layer and </v>

59
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>bill gets his ass lost in some kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>void.</v>

60
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you think this Jan was trippy </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

61
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.713
<v Speaker 1>peep this it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A giant turtle who created the universe </v>

62
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.790

<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you really want to kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you best are laying down that tube.</v>

64
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>So bill stopped flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite down on the monster's tongue and it</v>

65
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.970

<v Speaker 1>Lillo clown bitch.</v>

66
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.133
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the losers can't find their way out of </v>

67
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>the tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But beverly got an idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nasty oof the losers find their way out </v>

<v Speaker 1>they got to come back and put it in the </v>

73
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>ground no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as for Henry,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that full gets tossed in a loony bin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes the fall for all of its murders.</v>

75
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

117
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.703
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it acted like a mirror of the crooked </v>

118
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:04.374
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in dairy just picked this quote </v>

119
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>of homies jabbering about the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one glimpse I called him,</v>

120
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.213
<v Speaker 1>it looked like he had a winchester board</v>
<v Speaker 1>action and it wasn't until later that I </v>

121
00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:15.414
<v Speaker 1>figured out I must have thought of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I thought he had a </v>

122
00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>remington because that was what he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I asked Jimmy about it,</v>

123
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.110
<v Speaker 1>he said that guy was shooting the nose </v>
<v Speaker 1>spray field just like this.</v>

124
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

125
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.073
<v Speaker 1>Hey brotha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the monster packing the same </v>

126
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>piece?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were packing weapon.</v>

127
00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:39.600
<v Speaker 1>That the clown is a reflection of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the raw violence inside the heart.</v>

128
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Autumn Hood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>

129
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.113
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ain't no mistake that it roll around </v>

130
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 1>decked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of clown cars,</v>

131
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.793
<v Speaker 1>just like a clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people of dairy seemed nice to the </v>

132
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:53.490
<v Speaker 1>kids on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the inside it's all flows back.</v>

133
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Clown wouldn't even exist if it weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>for dairies.</v>

134
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:56.724
<v Speaker 1>Dark deeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it is only able to hit the scene </v>

135
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 1>when a horrible event go down like child</v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse on murder.</v>

136
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.413
<v Speaker 1>It's like a gnarly cycle where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>messed up things the dairy folk do </v>

137
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.813
<v Speaker 1>inspires it to terrorize the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then encourages the people to do </v>

138
00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:17.970
<v Speaker 1>even more wax because this cycle just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps going and going.</v>

139
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>It's been chilling in dairy for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass time.</v>

140
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.403
<v Speaker 1>It's become a part of dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something as much a part of the town is </v>

141
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:29.730
<v Speaker 1>the stand pipe or the Canal Abassi Park </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the library.</v>

142
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a matter of our geography.</v>

143
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it's gotten inside this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>

144
00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Jam Go even deeper because there'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>circular imagery all up in this huge ass</v>

145
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:41.754
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids struggled back to this hood </v>

146
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.064
<v Speaker 1>roots when they returned to dairy as </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults to lay a whip on the monster </v>

147
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.610
<v Speaker 1>beverly replaced or abusive daddy was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive husband.</v>

148
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.220
<v Speaker 1>The only way they're able to beat it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

149
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.113
<v Speaker 1>it's about throwing back to the mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that childhood and flats in their </v>

150
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.134
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even recognize that past events </v>

151
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.940
<v Speaker 1>happening all over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when big boy band pink,</v>

152
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>some bz reading the same story she read </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

153
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 1>am I supposed to believe that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidence because I don't.</v>

154
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.683
<v Speaker 1>There's something really stable in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and present together here or I'm </v>

155
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:16.674
<v Speaker 1>only imagining it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The losers always form a circle at </v>

156
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>important points.</v>

157
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like when they promised a wreck it if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad shows his face and Debbie again,</v>

158
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.823
<v Speaker 1>when adults try to remember what went </v>
<v Speaker 1>down back then and even when everybody </v>

159
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>gathers around a tab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beverly,</v>

160
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevermind man,</v>

161
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that she's the only like 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all this cycle job.</v>

162
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Just preaching a greater point about </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil just like it.</v>

163
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Evil been around since the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

164
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's only one humans arrived that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to take shape.</v>

165
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It says humans keep doing dark deeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again at been thriving for</v>

166
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's King's message evil only</v>

167
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.324
<v Speaker 1>because for real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when humans are allowed to take control </v>

168
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 1>of bus and got all my nasty qualities </v>
<v Speaker 1>like greed,</v>

169
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 1>jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violence,</v>

170
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 1>it's always been here since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time,</v>

171
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>since before there were men anywhere it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was here.</v>

172
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Then sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe waiting for the ice to melt,</v>

173
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.640
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the people to come out.</v>
