<v Speaker 1>The first thousand people to sign up </v>

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:04.024
<v Speaker 1>with the link in the description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get their first two months for </v>

3
00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>just 99 cents.</v>

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared.</v>

5
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.194
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we were working on our philosophy </v>

6
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>of Savio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across something very unexpected.</v>

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.953
<v Speaker 1>Apparently critics have noted a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural similarity between the soft </v>

8
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>films and French philosopher John Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sartre is famous play no exit,</v>

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.293
<v Speaker 1>so I watched all seven movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read no exit and immediately called </v>

10
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The connection was too tenuous.</v>

11
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Then Jigsaw came out and when I saw this</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.973
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome his wife's crack condition on </v>

13
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of Jigsaw and if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>more jigsaw related content,</v>

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.513
<v Speaker 1>head on over to wise crack plus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion for an exclusive podcast that </v>

15
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Speaker 1>dives deeper into the movie and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

16
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>spoilers and decapitations ahead like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all saw movies,</v>

17
00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:51.544
<v Speaker 1>Jigsaw starts with a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each player has to confess the horrible </v>

18
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>sin that snag them and exclusive invite </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world's worst warehouse party.</v>

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.793
<v Speaker 1>If they don't confess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll turn dead AAF given the chance </v>

20
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:03.664
<v Speaker 1>to save their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of the players take a solid pass </v>

21
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half-Baked Confession,</v>

22
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>not an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes after I felt like to work</v>

23
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>professing their innocence Honi my soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>is clean.</v>

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So one by one they're voted off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.003
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an assortment of Sketchy Detectives and </v>

26
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.704
<v Speaker 1>forensic pathologist try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>why gnarly corpses keep popping up all </v>

27
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>over the city could the very much dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Kramer Bita blame.</v>

28
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.803
<v Speaker 1>Eventually the film's creepy detective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and creepy forensics guy come face to </v>

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:40.464
<v Speaker 1>face in the ultimate creep off and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out that the forensics guy is the </v>

30
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>new jigsaw you're working around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am man.</v>

31
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.653
<v Speaker 1>Oh and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you just watched actually </v>

32
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>happened 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't worry about that.</v>

33
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Instead of focusing on the timeline </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake-out we're zeroing in on what brings</v>

34
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>fans to the soft films in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

35
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I want to play a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wholesome games.</v>

36
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>See in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jigsaw had one main party trick building</v>

37
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>traps to heinously and creatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture people.</v>

38
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.553
<v Speaker 1>But in the latest film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jigsaw has moved into a more </v>

39
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:12.924
<v Speaker 1>psychological realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing his victims to confess their </v>

40
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:16.524
<v Speaker 1>worst sins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both versions of the game consist of </v>

41
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>forcing a person to choose between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>unattractive options.</v>

42
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 3>There was only one open the decline</v>

43
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.913
<v Speaker 1>in the first seven films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cramer asked each victim to choose </v>

44
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.854
<v Speaker 1>between door a inflict excruciating pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>on themselves or others or door b give </v>

45
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>up and die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Jigsaw it,</v>

46
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>the game's been updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now his victims must choose between door</v>

47
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>a confessed to their worst sin in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a group of strangers and make it home</v>

48
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>in time for adult swim or door be die a </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful death.</v>

49
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 4>While I am sure there is a desire to </v>
<v Speaker 4>point fingers at me to the blog,</v>

50
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 4>that has been shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you can turn that thing inward,</v>

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 1>I assure you more blood will be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game is still sprinkled with head </v>

52
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>gnashing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leg ripping devices,</v>

53
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are more of a side show,</v>

54
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>a background threat perhaps to encourage</v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty.</v>

55
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.083
<v Speaker 1>The evolution of Jigsaws gain positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the act of confessing as the painful </v>

56
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>alternative to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central form of suffering that takes</v>

57
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>place in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the other films,</v>

58
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>confession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to be burning,</v>

59
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.754
<v Speaker 1>slashing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or ripping a flesh is treated as the </v>

60
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.334
<v Speaker 1>harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more pain inducing moral alternative to </v>

61
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>instant death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's backtrack for a second.</v>

62
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v Speaker 1>What moves jigsaw to devote his life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>making diy medieval torture devices in </v>

63
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we explained in our philosophy of saw</v>

64
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:41.044
<v Speaker 1>episode Kramer shares the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian view that suffering can be </v>

65
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.794
<v Speaker 1>transformative and even life changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so enduring his traps can strengthen a </v>

66
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>person's moral character and even redeem</v>
<v Speaker 1>them for past naughtiness.</v>

67
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.153
<v Speaker 1>As leader of this crossfit for the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jigsaw establishes himself as a godlike </v>

68
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.494
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing his moral agenda on his </v>

69
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>captive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

70
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>jigsaws new game draws from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of early Christianity,</v>

71
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.593
<v Speaker 1>public confession and public pennants </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild today centers can spill their guts </v>

72
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>in a low key gossip session with father </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior.</v>

73
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Third Century centers were frequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>required to confess their worst deeds in</v>

74
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>front of their entire Church </v>
<v Speaker 1>congregation and act known as Xml,</v>

75
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:22.744
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also a total bummer according to </v>

76
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>early Christian writer Tertullian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

77
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:28.594
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was an act meant to humiliate the </v>

78
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:30.964
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially rendering them so totally </v>

79
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would move God to mercy.</v>

80
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.093
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer demands the confessions of his </v>

81
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>captives in hopes of shaming them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once confession was over,</v>

82
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.213
<v Speaker 1>the person moved on to public pennants </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the humiliation only got Richard </v>

83
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.913
<v Speaker 1>Tertullian claims the center would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructed by their bishop to do things </v>

84
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>like lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sackcloth and ashes.</v>

85
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>The ashes were a sign of mourning for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your peace,</v>

86
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.903
<v Speaker 1>spiritual condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were forbidden to bape and had to </v>

87
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>eat only unseasoned food and drink to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass.</v>

88
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>The time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Centers would prostrate or lie stretched</v>

89
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:05.194
<v Speaker 1>out on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>groaning and crying while begging their </v>

90
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>church leader and fellow churchgoers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pray for them.</v>

91
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.103
<v Speaker 1>In Jigsaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna seems to be taking a similarly </v>

92
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>penitent pose as she begs Kramer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mercy.</v>

93
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.953
<v Speaker 1>So like a third century church leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer demands that his captives </v>

94
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:25.111
<v Speaker 1>publicly confessed their worst deeds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy do they clam up the second cigs.</v>

95
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:30.181
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask them to talk about their past </v>
<v Speaker 1>in previous installments.</v>

96
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.474
<v Speaker 1>The basic human desire to keep both </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs has made for a compelling </v>

97
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:39.721
<v Speaker 1>reason not to follow jigsaws commands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time it's just the characters shame</v>

98
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>that makes them reluctant to air their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty laundry.</v>

99
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>This creates some decidedly baffling </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

100
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.143
<v Speaker 1>Best exemplified early on when carly </v>
<v Speaker 1>finds out that Jigsaw has injected her </v>

101
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.284
<v Speaker 1>with a poison that can only be cured by </v>
<v Speaker 1>an antidote found in one of these three </v>

102
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>needles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the antidote,</v>

103
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.300
<v Speaker 1>one is harmless and one holds a potent </v>
<v Speaker 1>acid that will melt her face off and not</v>

104
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:01.814
<v Speaker 1>in the fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electric Daisy carnival way partly </v>

105
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>figures out which needle would save her </v>
<v Speaker 1>life because one is numbered.</v>

106
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>3.5300000000000002</v>

107
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.080
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who worse to me,</v>

108
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>which is the exact amount of money she </v>
<v Speaker 1>got after robbing and killing someone to</v>

109
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:18.164
<v Speaker 1>admit that though would serve as a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of confession so she doesn't say </v>

110
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that happens.</v>

111
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.793
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't carly confess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems odd unless you consider the </v>

112
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:29.924
<v Speaker 1>clue helpfully graffiti tag on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sign isn't just there for fire </v>

113
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.124
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reference to John Paul Sartre is </v>

114
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>famous play no exit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First a quick breakdown of the play.</v>

115
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.573
<v Speaker 1>Three dead souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inez is still and Joseph meetup in hell </v>

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>though this version of hell is less fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brimstone and more waiting room.</v>

117
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.513
<v Speaker 1>Wondering how they ended up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's telling Joseph make like the </v>

118
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>solving items and lie about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>

119
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 5>The studio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

120
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.970
<v Speaker 5>What have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are they send to here?</v>

121
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just it.</v>

122
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 5>I do know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

123
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering if there hasn't been some </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible mistake.</v>

124
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Eventually each confesses their worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeds.</v>

125
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Both Estelle and Joseph feel the weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>of judgment for their crimes.</v>

126
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.330
<v Speaker 1>So what does this play have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your favorite torture porn series?</v>

127
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.403
<v Speaker 1>Both center around a group of strangers </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in a room awaiting an unknown </v>

128
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but presumably horrific punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But perhaps a saw producer was guilty of</v>

129
00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:28.464
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia hang himself because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighth film really doubles down on the </v>

130
00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>no exit shtick in ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both big and small.</v>

131
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.933
<v Speaker 1>Notably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an eerie similarity of the </v>

132
00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:40.770
<v Speaker 1>crimes committed by Sartre's character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estelle and Jigsaws.</v>

133
00:07:40.771 --> 00:07:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Anna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 1>still after becoming pregnant by her </v>
<v Speaker 1>illicit lover,</v>

135
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.950
<v Speaker 1>drowned her newborn baby as he looked on</v>

136
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.520
<v Speaker 6>and he could see what I was up to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He kept on shouting.</v>

137
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.710
<v Speaker 6>It's style for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't he saw it?</v>

138
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was leaning over the balcony.</v>

139
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 6>He sold the ring spreading on the ward.</v>

140
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.710
<v Speaker 1>The words he killed himself in grief.</v>

141
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.710
<v Speaker 6>That is he wished he made.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He blew his brains out.</v>

142
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna suffocated her newborn child,</v>

143
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.320
<v Speaker 1>but convinced her husband it was his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault forcing him to commit suicide,</v>

144
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but now for the principal's similarity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between jigsaw and no exit,</v>

145
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the emphasis on the painful nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confession.</v>

146
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand why confession is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard in both works?</v>

147
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.443
<v Speaker 1>We need to examine sartre idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>look which he illustrates through the </v>

148
00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:37.374
<v Speaker 1>following example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're spying on your </v>

149
00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:41.490
<v Speaker 1>roommates awkward breakup through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>keyhole.</v>

150
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.563
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly you become aware of that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>other cooler roommate is down the </v>

151
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.300
<v Speaker 1>hallway watching you act creepy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>judging you for it.</v>

152
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.530
<v Speaker 1>This state of awareness of being watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>by others is called the look.</v>

153
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.513
<v Speaker 1>When you become aware of the look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are forced at least momentarily to </v>

154
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.104
<v Speaker 1>embody the viewpoint of what [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls the other or an outside entity </v>

155
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>with its own separate consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying the other's viewpoint.</v>

156
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>You feel a major discomfort.</v>

157
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.193
<v Speaker 1>I he shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which costs you to pretend that you </v>

158
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:12.114
<v Speaker 1>weren't spying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just smelling the door knob </v>

159
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>extended over a lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your awareness of the look causes you to</v>

160
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>live in authentically or what Sartre </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls bad faith.</v>

161
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.133
<v Speaker 1>Bad faith is basically a failure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly use your freedom or take </v>

162
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Kramer's prisoners certainly seem to</v>

163
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>be living in the baddest sort of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Carly,</v>

164
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>despite her clear choice to let a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>die by not giving her an inhaler,</v>

165
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 1>she sees it as an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

166
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>searcher would tell carly that even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing not to do anything,</v>

167
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.593
<v Speaker 1>she's still exercised her free will and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a choice to watch this lady </v>

168
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>asphyxiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

169
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.051
<v Speaker 1>Mitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna,</v>

170
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:52.884
<v Speaker 1>and Ryan all lie revising history to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make their crimes seemed like accidents </v>

171
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:57.354
<v Speaker 1>or honest mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer essentially accuses his captives </v>

172
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.110
<v Speaker 1>of first being criminals and second of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in bad faith</v>

173
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.153
<v Speaker 2>in the past who have all put your room </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to see if the world about your </v>

174
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 2>callousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your criminality</v>

175
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.243
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice Kramer's focus not just on each </v>

176
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>individual's crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on their subsequent lies.</v>

177
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Self deception and cover up.</v>

178
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't look in the mirror face who</v>

179
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The choices you have to feed the hyphen.</v>

180
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 2>You cannot escape the truth.</v>

181
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.413
<v Speaker 1>Sartre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarly used the mirror as a metaphor </v>

182
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>for the look of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

183
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Kramer's captives won't look in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual mirror.</v>

184
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:49.973
<v Speaker 1>He means that their crimes will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected back to them by the judgment </v>

185
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:53.304
<v Speaker 1>of their fellow prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That judgment can be torture all by </v>

186
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:56.694
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a reverse bear trap for your soul </v>

187
00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.843
<v Speaker 1>and no exit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the characters confess their </v>

188
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:02.154
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suffer anxiety about the judgment </v>

189
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:08.900
<v Speaker 1>of their peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't.</v>

190
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.610
<v Speaker 1>The funeral fret about their reputations</v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth slumped in the chair.</v>

191
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:14.444
<v Speaker 1>Is that thinking Gaza as a code?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's got to think of something that </v>

192
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Guss on a and beg for reassurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are not bad people.</v>

193
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 7>Just someone just one test would say </v>
<v Speaker 7>positively that I did not run away,</v>

194
00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 7>that I'm not the sort of man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He runs away,</v>

195
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 7>that I'm good and brave and decent and </v>
<v Speaker 7>all the rest of it.</v>

196
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>This leads Joseph to utter the famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

197
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.810
<v Speaker 1>How is other people not just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone always leave their cell phone on</v>

198
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:39.644
<v Speaker 1>in the movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the existence of other </v>

199
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:45.590
<v Speaker 1>people means the existence of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment and the shame that ensues.</v>

200
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That's particularly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If like Joseph,</v>

201
00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:50.840
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging out with people who know </v>
<v Speaker 1>your worst secrets.</v>

202
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 1>If Hell is other people knowing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst deeds,</v>

203
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense that confession is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer's new favorite torture device.</v>

204
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.503
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to force his captives who </v>
<v Speaker 1>face Joseph's anguish by making them </v>

205
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>publicly take responsibility for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

206
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.013
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes Ryan relive his own worst deed </v>

207
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.953
<v Speaker 1>as a drunk teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His joy ride inadvertently caused a </v>

208
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:11.164
<v Speaker 1>deadly car crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He escaped responsibility for it and </v>

209
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>tell all these years later,</v>

210
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I want to live</v>

211
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.843
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Searchers version of hell in no exit is </v>

212
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:25.080
<v Speaker 1>not the only one that the saw series </v>
<v Speaker 1>references.</v>

213
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.973
<v Speaker 1>John Kramer also must have studied up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dante's inferno and it's the 14th </v>

214
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:33.900
<v Speaker 1>century is how he and poet to picks his </v>
<v Speaker 1>own presumably fictional journey through</v>

215
00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:34.734
<v Speaker 1>the nine concentric circles of health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each housing eight different brand of </v>

216
00:12:37.651 --> 00:12:38.484
<v Speaker 1>sinners suffering for eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dante is hell is governed chiefly by a </v>

217
00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:45.420
<v Speaker 1>rule called Contra Paso Latin for to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer the opposite.</v>

218
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:46.403
<v Speaker 1>Under Contra Paso sinners suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishments that are either related to </v>

219
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.920
<v Speaker 1>or the extreme contrast of the crimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>they committed on earth.</v>

220
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.053
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astrologers and false prophets are </v>

221
00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:58.620
<v Speaker 1>forced to walk forever with their heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned backwards.</v>

222
00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.633
<v Speaker 1>A punishment for trying to look into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future or when the powerball chronic </v>

223
00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>suck ups are buried in excrement </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

224
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:06.683
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.853
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule of Contra Pato means that a </v>

226
00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:14.361
<v Speaker 1>person's eternity in hell is predestined</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their own freely chosen sins.</v>

227
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the saw series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cramer's show some flair for Contra Paso</v>

228
00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:19.014
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of the time he forced a heroin </v>

229
00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:23.190
<v Speaker 1>junkie to dig through a pit of needles </v>
<v Speaker 1>in search of a key.</v>

230
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.203
<v Speaker 1>Get it like her addiction is the trap or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cruel money lenders who had to pay </v>

231
00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:28.854
<v Speaker 1>for their lives in pounds of flesh or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the voyeuristic sex offender who had to </v>

232
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:34.710
<v Speaker 1>gouge his eyes out or lose all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbs.</v>

233
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Kramer's traps and Jigsaw also share </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the same,</v>

234
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry as Dornase and Ferno.</v>

235
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.333
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned that Mitch sold a motorcycle </v>

236
00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:46.830
<v Speaker 1>with a faulty brake to Kramer's nephew </v>
<v Speaker 1>who later died in an accident.</v>

237
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.813
<v Speaker 1>So what was Mitch is trap secure this </v>
<v Speaker 1>brake lever or be sliced up by a </v>

238
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:52.284
<v Speaker 1>circular metal blade and a jams of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine and we think Mitch is saved but </v>

239
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.233
<v Speaker 1>fittingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her homemade brake lever is faulty and </v>

240
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:00.714
<v Speaker 1>Mitch plummets into a death spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later Kramer presents the last two </v>

241
00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 1>survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna and Ryan,</v>

242
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 1>what their final game in the form of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single shotgun and a vague riddle.</v>

243
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.400
<v Speaker 1>If you want to achieve</v>

244
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.283
<v Speaker 2>your freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to realize we've been doing it </v>

245
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 2>backwards</v>

246
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 1>and I immediately lunges for the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that to win the game she has to</v>

247
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:27.721
<v Speaker 1>shoot Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then a broken key falls out.</v>

248
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Cramer had stored the key to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom inside the weapon.</v>

249
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna shows that she hasn't changed.</v>

250
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.220
<v Speaker 1>She remains willing to ruin or take </v>
<v Speaker 1>another life to save her own.</v>

251
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.233
<v Speaker 1>According to Kramer's reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna is ultimately trapped and killed </v>

252
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>not by his game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by her fundamental moral failings or</v>

253
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:48.304
<v Speaker 1>jigsaw stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making sense though is when her choice </v>

254
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.333
<v Speaker 1>also Ryan to be trapped in the barn </v>
<v Speaker 1>after he at least somewhat assumes </v>

255
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:56.054
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for his deadly joy ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from there on Jigsaw seems to </v>

256
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:00.074
<v Speaker 1>abandon any semblance of a moral lesson </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving from the doomed barn adventures </v>

257
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 1>to the less interesting laser color trap</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding detective Halloran and Logan,</v>

258
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 1>the forensics guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They each make their own confessions.</v>

259
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>

260
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.390
<v Speaker 1>And then logan fakes his death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes back to life and reveals that he's</v>

261
00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:19.224
<v Speaker 1>the new jigsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he leaves Halloran first debt </v>

262
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.530
<v Speaker 1>savage Logan May be John Kramer's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>man tribute band,</v>

263
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.440
<v Speaker 1>but will he further the moral philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the series?</v>

264
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.493
<v Speaker 1>Looks like we'll find out soon enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's already talk of a ninth saw </v>

265
00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>movie with Logan's final declaration I </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak to.</v>

266
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like we're in for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>forensic pathologists gone wild,</v>

267
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think was jigsaw and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insightful philosophical inquiry or just</v>

268
00:15:44.671 --> 00:15:45.504
<v Speaker 1>an excuse to watch a guy gets shredded </v>
<v Speaker 1>into confetti and is loken a generic </v>

269
00:15:49.021 --> 00:15:53.100
<v Speaker 1>creep with all the charisma of a latex </v>
<v Speaker 1>glove or the fresh new villain.</v>

270
00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:53.934
<v Speaker 1>The sauce series needed.</v>
