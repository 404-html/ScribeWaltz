00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>What's up everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared again?</v>

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful pipsqueak.</v>

3
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward.</v>

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.093
<v Speaker 1>Now full metal alchemist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood has all the trappings of an </v>

5
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>instant classic high concept science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction Shit.</v>

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight scenes,</v>

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>definitely strong philosophical core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>that's why we're here.</v>

9
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.053
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Throughout Edward and Alphonse's journey</v>
<v Speaker 1>to restore their bodies.</v>

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.773
<v Speaker 1>The two are confronted with various </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourses on the efficacy and </v>

12
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>application of science or in their case </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy.</v>

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.823
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's through alchemy that they hope to </v>

14
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:41.684
<v Speaker 1>recover their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also see it used for some </v>

15
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>pretty awful things.</v>

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>So what is brotherhood saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and the way it's applied to this</v>

17
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>world and how does faith fit into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion?</v>

18
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out.</v>

19
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack addition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of full metal alchemist,</v>

20
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course spoilers ahead,</v>

21
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>but first a quick primer full metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemist.</v>

22
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:08.804
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood is set in a mistress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country reminiscent of pre world war </v>

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.593
<v Speaker 1>two Europe who's defining feature is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>success of Alchemy or the manipulation </v>

24
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>and altering of matter using natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.203
<v Speaker 1>Alchemy is essentially treated as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>science one that combines chemistry and </v>

26
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>biology with its own unique laws and </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>alchemies most important law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law of equivalent exchange,</v>

28
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 3>non Nico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

29
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 3>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no</v>

30
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.313
<v Speaker 1>or you know the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means if you get the right </v>

31
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>materials and draw a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>

32
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>The show establishes a push and pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic between science and faith almost</v>

33
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:49.991
<v Speaker 1>immediately in episode three hour travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the desert town of or to investigate.</v>

34
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.053
<v Speaker 1>Father coordinate below a holy figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has gained control of the people by </v>

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>offering them with miracles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinating them in the faith of Lido</v>

36
00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second they arrived,</v>

37
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>though the brothers make their views </v>
<v Speaker 1>abundantly clear to the faithful</v>

38
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you motivated</v>

39
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>and their skepticism toward the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>is justified.</v>

40
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.633
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cornell's miracles are just cleverly </v>

41
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.574
<v Speaker 1>bailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Applications of alchemy that he uses to </v>

42
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:24.944
<v Speaker 1>attract followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to die for him at an Alec </v>

43
00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:28.940
<v Speaker 1>exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cornell is a fraud,</v>

44
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and liberate the people at your firm is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological tyranny.</v>

45
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>So science rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith drools,</v>

46
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>not so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the following episode,</v>

48
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>the brothers are sent to study under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sewing life alchemists show,</v>

49
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:42.654
<v Speaker 1>Tucker Tucker was the first outcome is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to successfully create a talking cmera </v>

50
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.123
<v Speaker 1>and tries to repeat his success in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to retain his state alchemist </v>

51
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:50.824
<v Speaker 1>certification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rx fascination quickly turns to </v>

52
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>horror and in one of the biggest gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches and anime history,</v>

53
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>we see this.</v>

54
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.683
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

55
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

56
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.583
<v Speaker 1>Tucker actually used his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog and his own daughter as components </v>

57
00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:13.910
<v Speaker 1>to create his Camaro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but far from feeling remorse.</v>

58
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Tucker claims he was only doing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>science demands</v>

59
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>nondual Zinger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.610
<v Speaker 2>simple moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little Jentezen Kendall,</v>

61
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Tau Mama Jemima.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send that out</v>

62
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.450
<v Speaker 1>in the face of such an atrocity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science no longer seemed so innocent,</v>

63
00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:33.284
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where does this conflict between </v>

64
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:36.770
<v Speaker 1>science and faith lead us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tucker,</v>

65
00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>the amoral alchemist in search of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific knowledge at any cost largely</v>

66
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:45.110
<v Speaker 1>sets the tone for the rest of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over at 64 episodes,</v>

67
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.003
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood forces us to question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>value of single mindedly clinging to </v>

68
00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:49.964
<v Speaker 1>science and the consequences of reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>all knowledge to scientific terms of </v>

69
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880
<v Speaker 1>motive thought loosely known in the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

70
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.700
<v Speaker 1>As scientism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I know what you're thinking,</v>

71
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.623
<v Speaker 1>jared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubting science is what people in a </v>

72
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.014
<v Speaker 1>coat do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just humoring when philosophers </v>

73
00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:05.264
<v Speaker 1>critique scientism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not saying that science is a </v>

74
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:08.294
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're criticizing is how we put </v>

75
00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:14.180
<v Speaker 1>scientific knowledge above all other </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and how we try to reduce other</v>

76
00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>forms of knowledge into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to philosopher Paul Fire,</v>

77
00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:18.524
<v Speaker 1>Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is just one of many competing </v>

78
00:04:20.481 --> 00:04:21.314
<v Speaker 1>explanatory frameworks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one which is neither as rational nor </v>

79
00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:26.360
<v Speaker 1>consistent as it pretends to be fire.</v>

80
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Robin's favorite example is copernicus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's heliocentric model of the universe</v>

81
00:04:30.651 --> 00:04:34.370
<v Speaker 1>was actually rejected by scientists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his day to them,</v>

82
00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:35.204
<v Speaker 1>aristotle's idea of celestial spheres </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered a fuller explanation of why the </v>

83
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 1>planets moved into the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Copernicus's model could correctly</v>

84
00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:45.980
<v Speaker 1>calculate the movement of the planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't explain why they moved,</v>

85
00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:46.814
<v Speaker 1>as they did until Newton's theory on </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity was published over a century </v>

86
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.623
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science in this case wasn't interested </v>

87
00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:57.110
<v Speaker 1>in the truth so much as self </v>
<v Speaker 1>preservation like any ideology fire.</v>

88
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Robin worries that an unquestioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance of it,</v>

89
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.883
<v Speaker 1>like with Leonora and Lito Ism can lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some potentially disastrous results </v>

90
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 1>in his book against method in science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a free society fire robin desks.</v>

91
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.123
<v Speaker 1>Is it not possible that science as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it today or a search for the truth </v>

92
00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:14.114
<v Speaker 1>and the style of traditional philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will create a monster and monsters are </v>

93
00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:21.020
<v Speaker 1>exactly what science creates in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of brotherhood,</v>

94
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 1>such as manmade Camaro's that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as ungodly experiment</v>

95
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 2>can put it into then when there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>

96
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.563
<v Speaker 1>This impersonal dehumanizing aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy is enshrined in the law of </v>

97
00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>equivalent exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which inherently reduces objects,</v>

98
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.813
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even people to their physical </v>

99
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:45.590
<v Speaker 1>components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oreck brothers entire journey starts</v>

100
00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:46.424
<v Speaker 1>because the to believe they can bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mother back to life by simply </v>

101
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.770
<v Speaker 1>transmuting the basic ingredients of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

102
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 1>This dehumanizing nature is furthered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of alchemies,</v>

103
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>most sought after the philosopher's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

104
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.043
<v Speaker 1>When Ed and ell decode Dr Marquez notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize the key ingredient to the </v>

105
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>stone is human life</v>

106
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.863
<v Speaker 2>kingdom.</v>

107
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.170
<v Speaker 1>The stone is the ultimate product of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy allowing its users to ignore the</v>

108
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:23.950
<v Speaker 1>law of equivalent exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even though the stone can restore at</v>

109
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:26.350
<v Speaker 1>now's bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two are reluctant,</v>

110
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 1>if not just plain unwilling to use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

111
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.850
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the homonculus artificial humans powered</v>

112
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>by philosopher stones regurgitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific philosophy,</v>

113
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>reducing the souls trapped within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stones,</v>

114
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.013
<v Speaker 1>Tamir alchemic principles while Ed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Al both use the power of the stones on </v>

115
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>one occasion each they do so while </v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting the autonomy of those souls,</v>

116
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay me,</v>

117
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.160
<v Speaker 2>to cuddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want me to come.</v>

118
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.783
<v Speaker 2>Committee,</v>

119
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.120
<v Speaker 1>this distinguishes the brothers as moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to philosopher Emmanuel Kant,</v>

120
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.073
<v Speaker 1>who famously stated that you must treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity whether in your own person or </v>

121
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>in the person of any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always at the same time as an end,</v>

122
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.113
<v Speaker 1>never merely as a means for people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>never meant to be used or reduced to </v>

123
00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:42.754
<v Speaker 1>calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather are always a goal in </v>

124
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:45.484
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But an analysis problem with alchemy is </v>

125
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:48.664
<v Speaker 1>larger than it's impersonal nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it's subservience to the </v>

126
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:53.074
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alchemy is so under the control of the </v>

127
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:56.164
<v Speaker 1>industry and government that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually three state appointed tenants </v>

128
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:01.930
<v Speaker 1>of Alchemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of which is the literally obey</v>

129
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the military who go drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

130
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.920
<v Speaker 1>somebody seeing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't call me Jessica goodness.</v>

131
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.783
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state alchemists are generally referred </v>

132
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>to as dogs at the military and even as </v>
<v Speaker 1>human weapons.</v>

133
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

134
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.950
<v Speaker 1>In his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science wars sociologists,</v>

135
00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:23.784
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Aronowitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>argues that scientists often view </v>

136
00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:26.634
<v Speaker 1>themselves as vehicles facilitating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancement of learning and by </v>

137
00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:30.954
<v Speaker 1>application the progress of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet scientists funding must come from </v>

138
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and often it's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations or the state.</v>

139
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.463
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists don't really own their </v>

140
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:42.744
<v Speaker 1>discoveries and have little say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their application throughout the </v>

141
00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:46.644
<v Speaker 1>animate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ed Constantly clashes with this </v>

142
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 1>militarization of science by the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his own complicity with it.</v>

143
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.730
<v Speaker 1>As Alex Armstrong succinctly puts it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple</v>

144
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.833
<v Speaker 5>thinking just a shoe tie shoe and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll have a new Audi Shindand </v>

145
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.400
<v Speaker 5>accuser,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the hospital loading it.</v>

146
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.893
<v Speaker 5>Recall it.</v>

147
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.510
<v Speaker 1>We even see this military influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>distort the basic principles of science.</v>

148
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.170
<v Speaker 1>When ed and ell reminisce about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained on a desert island as children,</v>

149
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.093
<v Speaker 1>they come to the epiphany that alchemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is all about understanding the natural </v>

150
00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.324
<v Speaker 1>flow of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both deconstructing and reconstructing </v>

151
00:09:22.121 --> 00:09:22.954
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

152
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 3>so now that Lcd Bouzouki stair cycle,</v>

153
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>what this principle is leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted in the mouths of the military in</v>

154
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 1>justifying destroying the whole country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and slaughtering its population.</v>

155
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>One general even goes so far as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rephrase it as alchemic rebirth.</v>

156
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.753
<v Speaker 6>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see them almost that you didn't get a </v>

157
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.120
<v Speaker 6>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you punk in night.</v>

158
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.240
<v Speaker 6>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>

159
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 6>Social Security goes through to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

160
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.593
<v Speaker 6>Lacey,</v>

161
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.363
<v Speaker 1>as tools of the government alchemists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have become the very instruments of the </v>

162
00:10:09.491 --> 00:10:13.810
<v Speaker 1>series chief antagonist father who </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls the MSG in state,</v>

163
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.740
<v Speaker 1>father desires nothing more than to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume the mantle of God,</v>

164
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.840
<v Speaker 1>a goal which he's used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy,</v>

165
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.793
<v Speaker 1>countless military conflicts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of innocent lives to prepare </v>

166
00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:25.090
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

167
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.090
<v Speaker 1>a masters is most brutal and heartless </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

168
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.313
<v Speaker 1>The war of extermination was fought just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a further father's plan and it's this </v>

169
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:37.390
<v Speaker 1>war where the state alchemists made </v>
<v Speaker 1>their largest military impact.</v>

170
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Good job or we've got an issue bothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

171
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:41.994
<v Speaker 1>It's all clinical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's shocking about each ball isn't </v>

172
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 1>just the devastating force that alchemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrecked on it.</v>

173
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 1>The scientific language used to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

174
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Even the good guys here can't help but </v>
<v Speaker 1>couch.</v>

175
00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:57.634
<v Speaker 1>What's essentially genocide in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sterile scientific terms almost on the </v>

176
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.220
<v Speaker 1>cable issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bird.</v>

177
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

178
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.630
<v Speaker 1>this sanitizing nature of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is what escalated,</v>

179
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 1>fallen wharton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new heights as fear.</v>

180
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.963
<v Speaker 1>King Bradley told the high priest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow when he offered himself up in </v>

181
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:17.384
<v Speaker 1>exchange for a ceasefire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The law of equivalent exchange won't </v>

182
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:20.500
<v Speaker 1>allow it</v>

183
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 5>so much coaching or one on one or so </v>
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>

184
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.620
<v Speaker 1>the fewer even considered his wife to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than an expendable pond for</v>

185
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:38.110
<v Speaker 1>his greater scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

186
00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 1>if the title of purer is raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows among you,</v>

187
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.923
<v Speaker 1>there's a good reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country have a masters is </v>

188
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:45.860
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of pre World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

189
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:46.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton nation expanding beyond its </v>

190
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:51.950
<v Speaker 1>borders and a blonde haired blue eyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>army whose uniforms look a lot like that</v>

191
00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:52.784
<v Speaker 1>of the SSS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the might is right motivation </v>

192
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>behind Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbles to the surface and a mistress as</v>

193
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>general raven invoke social darwinism to</v>
<v Speaker 1>justify mass extermination.</v>

194
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.340
<v Speaker 7>So John,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you could go so good though,</v>

195
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 7>you know what you should see how you use</v>
<v Speaker 7>of.</v>

196
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.483
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough to convince you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you only have to compare a </v>

197
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.563
<v Speaker 1>mistresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human experiments did that of Auschwitz </v>

198
00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:17.334
<v Speaker 1>as lead Dr Josef Mengele,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's raising babies and </v>

199
00:12:20.461 --> 00:12:21.294
<v Speaker 1>underground laboratories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stitching together people in animals or </v>

200
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.403
<v Speaker 1>ripping soltes from bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say that a mistress lacks </v>

201
00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 1>the same wanton cruelty and morbid </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific curiosity that defined mangle</v>

202
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:33.874
<v Speaker 1>his operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mengele established a kindergarten at </v>

203
00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:37.134
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz for his younger experiments </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly stitching to gypsy girls </v>

204
00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if he could have gotten his hands on</v>

205
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>a literal soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably would have mutilated.</v>

206
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.093
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we mention that fire robin to </v>

207
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.880
<v Speaker 1>actually fought as a lieutenant in World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II,</v>

208
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.300
<v Speaker 1>even earning an iron cross in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

209
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.900
<v Speaker 1>witnessing firsthand the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments made by a dictatorship for war</v>

210
00:12:57.901 --> 00:12:58.734
<v Speaker 1>and genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise that fire robin would </v>

211
00:13:01.051 --> 00:13:01.884
<v Speaker 1>one day proposed a separation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and states with ultimate power </v>

212
00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:10.200
<v Speaker 1>resting in democracy in his lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to defend society from science.</v>

213
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.093
<v Speaker 1>He argued there must be a formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>separation between state and science </v>

214
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.120
<v Speaker 1>just as there is now a formal separation</v>
<v Speaker 1>between state and church.</v>

215
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Scientists may be consulted on important</v>
<v Speaker 1>projects,</v>

216
00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:21.804
<v Speaker 1>but the final judgment must be left to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the democratically elected consulting </v>

217
00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:25.914
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's safe to say that full metal </v>

218
00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:32.190
<v Speaker 1>alchemist presents a cautionary tale </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the blind adherence to science,</v>

219
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.590
<v Speaker 1>but what does it say about faith?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

220
00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:35.424
<v Speaker 1>throughout its 64 episode run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith is often portrayed as another </v>

221
00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:41.580
<v Speaker 1>explanatory model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another source of truth and power.</v>

222
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.653
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a show populated almost entirely by </v>

223
00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:45.504
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters make a number of appeals </v>

224
00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>to faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the episode,</v>

225
00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.580
<v Speaker 1>the miracle of Brush Valley and an owl </v>
<v Speaker 1>witness,</v>

226
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.414
<v Speaker 1>the delivery of a baby become awestruck </v>
<v Speaker 1>and point out the limitations of </v>

227
00:13:55.741 --> 00:14:00.741
<v Speaker 1>alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Marco,</v>

228
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:06.464
<v Speaker 1>the alchemist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>largely responsible for the creation of </v>

229
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher's stone during the civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

230
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.533
<v Speaker 1>calls it fate that he met the ish fallen</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar before the to set out together to </v>

231
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.090
<v Speaker 1>challenge the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

232
00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:17.924
<v Speaker 1>Knox who worked as a doctor during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war and was subsequently estranged from </v>

233
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:24.290
<v Speaker 1>his family invokes God when they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>returned to him.</v>

234
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 8>Some of similar you can let me know.</v>

235
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.380
<v Speaker 7>Even Bradley,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a Homunculus wonders if his own death at</v>

236
00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:37.290
<v Speaker 7>the hand of scar was providence coming </v>
<v Speaker 7>with Shinji.</v>

237
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.173
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>

238
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.040
<v Speaker 7>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You Know Kim?</v>

239
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.660
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what in you are it</v>

240
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.333
<v Speaker 1>Bradley?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who mercilessly killed these people </v>

241
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.094
<v Speaker 1>during the war was told that God would </v>
<v Speaker 1>strike him down one day and it was the </v>

242
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:51.974
<v Speaker 1>son looking like a crescent moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which together symbolize God in Alchemy </v>

243
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that blinded him and allowed scar too.</v>

244
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.380
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The finishing blow</v>

245
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.460
<v Speaker 1>is that the thematic takeaway of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>

246
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Science is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith is good.</v>

247
00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:07.420
<v Speaker 1>So keep on praying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:08.254
<v Speaker 1>not quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the problem with scientism isn't </v>

249
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:12.700
<v Speaker 1>that science is bad and that non science</v>
<v Speaker 1>is good.</v>

250
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin isn't giving the middle finger to </v>

251
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:17.470
<v Speaker 1>vaccines and posting about chem trails </v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter.</v>

252
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

253
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.443
<v Speaker 1>his main contention is that science is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just one of many ideas that propel </v>

254
00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:23.994
<v Speaker 1>society and should be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus what fire alb into poses is any </v>

255
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.413
<v Speaker 1>unreflective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veneration of any ideology because it </v>

256
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:31.804
<v Speaker 1>inhibits free thought as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind following of science as the </v>

257
00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:36.094
<v Speaker 1>arbiter of truth is just as harmful as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind following of faith as the </v>

258
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:40.774
<v Speaker 1>arbiter of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's father cornell and the </v>

259
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.533
<v Speaker 1>homonculus using the Lido is to incite </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence against their enemies or scar </v>

260
00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:51.070
<v Speaker 1>using his god is Vala to justify his </v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance against the alchemist</v>

261
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.310
<v Speaker 7>meaningfully Camino Sindhis.</v>

262
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.983
<v Speaker 1>Faith alone can be every bit justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary as science characters grow and </v>

263
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:02.564
<v Speaker 1>brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they realized the limitations of </v>

264
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:07.370
<v Speaker 1>adhering to any one ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward and Alphonse,</v>

265
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:08.204
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to question the foundations of </v>

266
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.544
<v Speaker 1>western Alchemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which supposedly takes us energy from </v>

267
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>the tectonic movements of the earth's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mantle.</v>

268
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.770
<v Speaker 1>When father manages to cancel it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their quest for an explanation that</v>

269
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>leads them to science as eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent alcohol history,</v>

270
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 1>which uses life energy from the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ultimately bridging the gap between</v>

271
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 1>these two ideologies that allows our </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes to eventually trial.</v>

272
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>The two different scientists come </v>
<v Speaker 1>together to make a reverse transmutation</v>

273
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>circle that saves the lives of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>semesters.</v>

274
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps no character embodies this </v>
<v Speaker 1>development more than scar,</v>

275
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>a survivor of the Ashmolean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war of extinction,</v>

276
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.183
<v Speaker 1>scar target state alchemists out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge to him not only are alchemists </v>

277
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:48.194
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they transgress against God who </v>

278
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:51.194
<v Speaker 1>alone possesses the right to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as scar learns more about a </v>

279
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.184
<v Speaker 1>mistress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he realizes how wrong he was to seek </v>

280
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>vengeance.</v>

281
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.830
<v Speaker 7>No new tool you will can you committed </v>
<v Speaker 7>to you in show who who Costanoa Tj</v>

282
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.083
<v Speaker 1>scar who wants cloaked his actions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words of God finally understands </v>

283
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:09.314
<v Speaker 1>that no ideology can justify murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scar even breaks from the strict laws </v>

284
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:14.174
<v Speaker 1>that govern his fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making use of the very alchemy that his </v>

285
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:20.110
<v Speaker 1>god a board in order to save the country</v>

287
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.933
<v Speaker 1>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transformation stands in stark contrast </v>

288
00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:33.310
<v Speaker 1>to the show's main antagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father,</v>

289
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.580
<v Speaker 1>who clings to his single minded belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>in science.</v>

290
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.533
<v Speaker 1>Father becomes obsessed with the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>of alchemy and takes this obsession to </v>

291
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:41.524
<v Speaker 1>the logical extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viewing mankind is little more than </v>

292
00:17:44.171 --> 00:17:49.171
<v Speaker 1>materials for him to use in becoming God</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on blinded by scientism.</v>

293
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.073
<v Speaker 1>Father can't understand the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human emotions and discards them in his </v>

294
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:56.244
<v Speaker 1>attempt to become perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally ripped the seven deadly </v>

295
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>sins from himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lust,</v>

296
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaw,</v>

297
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 1>gluttony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>envy,</v>

298
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>wrath and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who in turn become the other homonculus.</v>

299
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.813
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this conviction and the absolute </v>

300
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:11.424
<v Speaker 1>supremacy of science and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve perfection through it that </v>

301
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.624
<v Speaker 1>undoes father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the souls trapped in the philosopher's </v>

302
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 1>stone which he dismissed as we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

303
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 1>begin to assert their wills and rebel </v>
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>

304
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.743
<v Speaker 1>Father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of a soul as a mere </v>

305
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.723
<v Speaker 1>ingredient fails to account for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomy of these individuals after an </v>

306
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.193
<v Speaker 1>epic punch to the gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father is finally killed and dragged </v>

307
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:34.524
<v Speaker 1>back into the void from whence he came </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he meets the real god of being </v>

308
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 1>called truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still desperately clinging to scientism.</v>

309
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Father demands to know what he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

310
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.233
<v Speaker 1>unlike scar and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father refused to recognize any kind of </v>

311
00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 1>human wisdom beyond alchemy.</v>

312
00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.720
<v Speaker 8>I didn't really three already.</v>

313
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.183
<v Speaker 1>All of this goes to show what makes ed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now particularly special throughout </v>

314
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:12.054
<v Speaker 1>the series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're humble rejection of a single </v>

315
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:14.724
<v Speaker 1>ideology from the shows outset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the to grapple with what alchemy is and </v>

316
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>what it means to be a state alchemist.</v>

317
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.413
<v Speaker 8>The</v>

318
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.480
<v Speaker 1>this questioning that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother's seen both naive and likable at</v>

319
00:19:28.481 --> 00:19:32.260
<v Speaker 1>the brothers core is a strong desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover their own truth.</v>

320
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.760
<v Speaker 1>When psychopath extraordinary solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Kim Lee has alphonse cornered.</v>

321
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He wonders why our hero doesn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the philosopher's stone and get his</v>

322
00:19:40.571 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 1>body back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of this will not.</v>

323
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:42.963
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jibo,</v>

<v Speaker 1>disco.</v>

325
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.103
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country would face certain </v>

326
00:19:48.071 --> 00:19:48.904
<v Speaker 1>destruction from father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just equivalent exchange </v>

327
00:19:51.371 --> 00:19:53.530
<v Speaker 1>inaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to get their bodies back,</v>

328
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to give up the world safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>

329
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:56.754
<v Speaker 1>Go quote on the Horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our rejects that alchemic worldview </v>

330
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 1>reaffirming their desire to find their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own truth.</v>

331
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>simple.</v>

332
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's this search for possibilities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes the brothers and allows ed</v>

333
00:20:12.851 --> 00:20:13.684
<v Speaker 1>to make his final transmutation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After al sacrifices himself in order to </v>

334
00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:18.004
<v Speaker 1>give ed his arm back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ed follows his brother into the portal </v>

335
00:20:20.351 --> 00:20:23.260
<v Speaker 1>to bring him back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When asked by the truth what price he'll</v>

336
00:20:23.261 --> 00:20:24.094
<v Speaker 1>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edd smiles and offers this ability to </v>

337
00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 1>perform alchemy and recognizes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance and thinking that outcome.</v>

338
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:32.740
<v Speaker 1>He could explain everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone solve all his problems.</v>

339
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.750
<v Speaker 8>She didn't need to go to the citadel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Coke.</v>

340
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.250
<v Speaker 8>It's the dog or the dog.</v>

341
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.353
<v Speaker 1>Unlike father who couldn't accept his </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the universe and equated </v>

342
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.550
<v Speaker 1>alchemy with power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ed knows the truth.</v>

343
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not anymore.</v>

344
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Keeps you the their bodies back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

345
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Save what's left for our heroes to do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical elric fashion.</v>

346
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the keep searching for truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>new methods to discover it.</v>

347
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 1>As Alphonse puts it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to give back to the people who</v>

348
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:16.460
<v Speaker 1>helped them all along their journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a simple given.</v>

349
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Take not a cold formula like the law of </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent exchange.</v>

350
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.280

<v Speaker 1>Alice traveling east and Ed West in </v>

354
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>hopes of gathering all the knowledge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make this principle a reality.</v>

355
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.253
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old habits tend to die hard and when ed </v>

356

359
00:21:58.011 --> 00:22:01.730
<v Speaker 1>home to realize that science alone can't</v>
