<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick around to the end of the video for</v>

2
00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>a behind the scenes look of what we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking up for the future of wise crack.</v>

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.634
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just like everyone else with a ps </v>

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:15.054
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been grinding my thumbs to nubs </v>

6
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:17.814
<v Speaker 1>playing God of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you haven't had the pleasure to </v>

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.544
<v Speaker 1>play it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are pretty different this time </v>

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Change the forest feels different.</v>

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Everything is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do well on it.</v>

11
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Instead of a roid raging Greek god of </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction who experience points,</v>

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.483
<v Speaker 1>Credo says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now a melancholy dream daddy complete </v>

13
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.634
<v Speaker 1>with a child in a dead wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stark changing credos got me </v>

14
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:46.564
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this part of a much larger </v>

15
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>zeitgeisty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See something is happening to our heroes</v>

16
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.503
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look no further than wolverine and Luke </v>

17
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Skywalker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to Wolverine?</v>

18
00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Go from this colorful murder machine to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this angsty old man.</v>

19
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.383
<v Speaker 1>And how did luke go from this starry </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyed vendor keen to this disenchanted </v>

20
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>recluse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the same vein,</v>

21
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.563
<v Speaker 1>how did Credo Sco from this blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging harbinger of death to this </v>

22
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>bummed out widower?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:12.904
<v Speaker 1>to figure out why this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to visit the era </v>

24
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>defined by the king of swagger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Duke.</v>

25
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.383
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack addition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>age of the post hero and stay frosty </v>

26
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spoilers ahead.</v>

27
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Before the marvel industrial complex was</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a glimmer in Stanley's I,</v>

28
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>there was another genre that dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>film and an all too familiar way.</v>

29
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>The Western,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to theorist,</v>

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>will ride all westerns are born from one</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic formulation,</v>

31
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the story of a loan stranger who rides </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a troubled town and cleans it up.</v>

32
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Winning the respect of the townsfolk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the love of the school,</v>

33
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:48.484
<v Speaker 1>Barb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other plots are all built upon its </v>

34
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>symbolic foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Westerns from the likes of John Ford,</v>

35
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Clint Eastwood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Sergio Leone dominated the Hollywood</v>

36
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:57.934
<v Speaker 1>landscape for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no need for iron man or </v>

37
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:01.324
<v Speaker 1>captain America when you had Clint </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastwood being a bad ass and John Wayne </v>

38
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>leaking Americana all over every set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walked on.</v>

39
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Young Fella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for trouble,</v>

40
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll accommodate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>

41
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Where'd all the cowboys go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood had a sort of western </v>
<v Speaker 1>backlash.</v>

43
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Instead of producing traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westerns,</v>

44
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.843
<v Speaker 1>they started making a kind of anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>western or what were called post </v>

45
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.104
<v Speaker 1>westerns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas your traditional western wood </v>

46
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.714
<v Speaker 1>basket in the heroics of this gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of a livermore post western would </v>

47
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>show us this</v>

48
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 3>slim gimme Gimme some water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please flip flip.</v>

49
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.663
<v Speaker 1>The basic idea is that post westerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>redeployed Western tropes to make new </v>

50
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.330
<v Speaker 1>arguments about the ideas that westerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>took for granted.</v>

51
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything else,</v>

52
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:54.514
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to show you how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at a true classic </v>

53
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>post Western unforgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unforgiven follows William Money,</v>

54
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.493
<v Speaker 1>a retired gunslinger who's legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talent for shooting was fueled by his </v>

55
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>old friend whiskey.</v>

56
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I like whiskey done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's anything else.</v>

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I ain't had a drop in over 10 years</v>

58
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.463
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sober and trying to live a peaceful </v>

59
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raising pigs.</v>

60
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>William gets pulled back into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gunslinger life to save his farm.</v>

61
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:24.994
<v Speaker 1>And family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unforgiven is a post western because it </v>

62
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>takes the formulation of the western and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flips it.</v>

63
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>The heroes aren't mysterious and hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean anything up,</v>

64
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.863
<v Speaker 1>but rather bring chaos with them in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quest for peace that isn't about a town </v>

65
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>or ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but about themselves and the future.</v>

66
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>This structure of the hero leaving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of violence and mid behind only to</v>

67
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>be pulled back in is exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of you guessed it,</v>

68
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>the god of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan and the last Jedi.</v>

69
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.453
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they resemble the qualities of a post </v>

70
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>western almost perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with God of war.</v>

71
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Credos left behind his violent past,</v>

72
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.550
<v Speaker 1>went to the woods to raise a family </v>
<v Speaker 1>after his wife dies,</v>

73
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 1>dns on a tray and travel across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm.</v>

74
00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:10.754
<v Speaker 1>Sue sprinkle her ashes from the tallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>peak so we can already see a retired </v>

75
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:17.030
<v Speaker 1>warrior looking for a calm life of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chopping down trees,</v>

76
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.100
<v Speaker 1>hunting and yelling at his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at me,</v>

77
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

78
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

79
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

80
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.843
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

81
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 1>But of course nothing is easy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets roped back in.</v>

82
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:27.134
<v Speaker 1>When bulger gets wind of his presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tries to hunt him in a tray is on </v>

83
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>their journey similar to William Money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who must drink whiskey to revert back to</v>

84
00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:38.510
<v Speaker 1>the legendary murderer in order to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>the town and ensure his family safety.</v>

85
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.493
<v Speaker 1>Credo says forced to bust out the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>blades and revert to the death machine </v>

86
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:47.030
<v Speaker 1>we know and love in order to save a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trace immediately he's confronted by the</v>

87
00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 1>ghosts of his past and the reality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't escape it.</v>

88
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>You cannot change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will sound familiar.</v>

89
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Just like Credo slogan used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>turbo badass death dealer.</v>

90
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean his bones are covered in metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>

91
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.180
<v Speaker 1>who's that living in the desert like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of weird hermit.</v>

92
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.193
<v Speaker 1>It's our boy wolverine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's old and sad and has a daughter </v>

93
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:20.690
<v Speaker 1>now and goes by Logan,</v>

94
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.190
<v Speaker 2>your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we took you in.</v>

95
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.670
<v Speaker 1>You have logan imagines be wolverine as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a past.</v>

96
00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:32.504
<v Speaker 1>His prime limo driver who takes care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his elderly foster father in the first </v>

97
00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:37.004
<v Speaker 1>few minutes of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his aversion to violence has put on </v>

98
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do what's soon.</v>

99
00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:43.424
<v Speaker 1>He's caught up protecting a young girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>from assassins cyborgs and other goons </v>

100
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.523
<v Speaker 1>like in God of war and unforgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan is only drawn back into violence </v>

101
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.310
<v Speaker 1>by his desire to protect and help a </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger generation,</v>

102
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.353
<v Speaker 1>but despite his intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violence follows him and innocent </v>

103
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:00.314
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farm is turned into a slaughterhouse in </v>

104
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.074
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan tries again to leave the violence </v>

105
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.774
<v Speaker 1>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sneaks back into his life as </v>

106
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.294
<v Speaker 1>Laura and the other children are </v>
<v Speaker 1>captured and Logan's got to do some </v>

107
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>savings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

108
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:12.974
<v Speaker 1>he comes to terms with the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a serum like a certain whiskey </v>

109
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>shot and goes hog wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He embraces the violence as the only way</v>

110
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:25.691
<v Speaker 1>to save Laura and finally finds peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to unforgiven.</v>

111
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention Shane,</v>

112
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.030
<v Speaker 4>there's no going back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right or wrong.</v>

113
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 4>It's brand brand sticks,</v>

114
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.533
<v Speaker 1>logan and God of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show us a former warrior turned </v>

115
00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:40.684
<v Speaker 1>protector who must swap the shield for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sword or a gun or clause or blades of </v>

116
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:45.964
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that all they want is </v>

117
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:52.000
<v Speaker 1>to leave that life behind a try over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over to get away,</v>

118
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but they get pulled back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>

119
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Test what I thought I was out credos </v>
<v Speaker 1>once a peaceful life for his son,</v>

120
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and that means war with the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan wants to protect Laura.</v>

121
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.590
<v Speaker 1>That means releasing the beast.</v>

122
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.573
<v Speaker 1>Money wants to help his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means hunting down those who might </v>

123
00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:12.934
<v Speaker 1>come after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the choice to confront their </v>

124
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:19.030
<v Speaker 1>painful nature for the sake of helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>others that ultimately redeemed credos,</v>

125
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>logan and money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does the last Jedi?</v>

126
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I fit into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite the same,</v>

127
00:07:24.581 --> 00:07:27.430
<v Speaker 1>but just as those characters are forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Donna Mantle,</v>

128
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.430
<v Speaker 1>they've dreamt of leaving behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to does space.</v>

129
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Hobo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke Skywalker,</v>

130
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>he isolates himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renounces his legend,</v>

131
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.553
<v Speaker 1>and even gives up using the force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose just as the Post Western </v>

132
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 1>reevaluates the glory of the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western.</v>

133
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.073
<v Speaker 1>So too does the last jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reevaluate the deeds of the jet I </v>

134
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:53.710
<v Speaker 1>order and the mess they've left the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy in at the height of their powers.</v>

135
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>They allowed God city cities to rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the empire and wiped them out.</v>

136
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.473
<v Speaker 1>It was a jetta I master who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the training and </v>

137
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:01.774
<v Speaker 1>creation of Darth vader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the resistance is about to be </v>

138
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:08.350
<v Speaker 1>completely snuffed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke must stop fleeing from his past and</v>

139
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 1>reignite the legend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

140
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.073
<v Speaker 1>to sustain the light and save his sister</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ready to die because just like the </v>

141
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:18.100
<v Speaker 1>other characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's giving something to the future.</v>

142
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.190
<v Speaker 1>The myth of scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is this happening to our heroes?</v>

143
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all goes back to myths.</v>

144
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 1>As Right said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a myth is a communication from a society</v>

145
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:30.724
<v Speaker 1>to its members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social concepts and attitudes </v>

146
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:33.964
<v Speaker 1>determined by the history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions of a society are </v>

147
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 1>communicated to its members through its </v>
<v Speaker 1>myths.</v>

148
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.443
<v Speaker 1>Put simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myths are the stories society tells </v>

149
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:43.474
<v Speaker 1>itself about itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we saw the posts western </v>

150
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.240
<v Speaker 1>emerge in the shadow of Watergate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam.</v>

151
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.313
<v Speaker 1>We needed stories that reflected an age </v>
<v Speaker 1>of distrust in institutions and a lack </v>

152
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:54.814
<v Speaker 1>of belief in the American myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's similar to where we ended up as a </v>

153
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:58.554
<v Speaker 1>culture after the 2008 financial crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why suddenly we're seeing this </v>

154
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:03.114
<v Speaker 1>pattern reemerge all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're even seeing this self critical </v>

155
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>turn in the greatest mythic framework of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time,</v>

156
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the superhero movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the best marvel movies.</v>

157
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.823
<v Speaker 1>Winter soldier has captain America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poster boy for the American way </v>

158
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.210
<v Speaker 1>questioning the US government for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just taking down the carriers.</v>

159
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Neck were taken down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shields or learns,</v>

160
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:22.884
<v Speaker 1>a real leader has to confront their </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations ugly history and all the pain </v>

161
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:26.694
<v Speaker 1>that comes with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark has space combat ptsd and </v>

162
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.444
<v Speaker 1>iron man three and in civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of his actions come </v>

163
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:34.254
<v Speaker 1>back to haunt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Superman has issues figuring out </v>

164
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:37.824
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the one thing superman is </v>

165
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 1>supposed to know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of our mythical figures are spared,</v>

166
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I mean by the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the post zero.</v>

167
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>If Post westerns emerged as people tired</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the same myths from an era passed our</v>

168
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>post heroes like Credos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logan and Luke skywalker's signaling the</v>

169
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:55.764
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're currently in the process of </v>

170
00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:58.644
<v Speaker 1>questioning our cultural myths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of myths will we make to </v>

171
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:02.484
<v Speaker 1>replace them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what will these myths tell us about </v>

172
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>the society we want to build?</v>

173
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Thanks for watching guys and thanks for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sticking around.</v>

174
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.400
<v Speaker 5>Things may look like business as usual </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the channel,</v>

175
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:14.234
<v Speaker 5>but we've actually been busting our ass </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooking up some awesome new pilots </v>

176
00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:17.564
<v Speaker 5>behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're working on more shows about </v>

177
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 5>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of shows about current events,</v>

178
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 5>more about science and even a show about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stock market.</v>

179
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to give you guys a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>sneak peek as to what's in the works.</v>

180
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.773
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so first up we got to show that is </v>

181
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:30.494
<v Speaker 5>actually premiering in late June called </v>
<v Speaker 5>the film tourists where I go inside </v>

182
00:10:34.311 --> 00:10:35.144
<v Speaker 5>cinema classics and break down the film </v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques that make them smart and </v>

183
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.820
<v Speaker 5>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So where we usually talk about ideology,</v>

184
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:41.654
<v Speaker 5>philosophy in subtext here we're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be focusing more on the form and the </v>

185
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:48.950
<v Speaker 5>technique and how those things make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>films so darn good.</v>

186
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.053
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there I am inhabiting the shot of the </v>

187
00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:53.330
<v Speaker 5>wolf of Wall Street.</v>

188
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 5>The next one we got up is called how did</v>
<v Speaker 5>we get here,</v>

189
00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:56.894
<v Speaker 5>which is an animated series with a super</v>
<v Speaker 5>talented artists that I went to college </v>

190
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:00.860
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Her name is tyler.</v>

191
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm so excited to be able to bring her </v>
<v Speaker 5>vision to the world.</v>

192
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 5>This is going to be exploring current </v>
<v Speaker 5>events and the forces that shape them.</v>

193
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:11.140
<v Speaker 5>So this pilot episode is actually about </v>
<v Speaker 5>fake news and Fahrenheit 4:51,</v>

194
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.983
<v Speaker 5>the Ray Bradbury book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Other thing we have going on is another </v>

195
00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:14.414
<v Speaker 5>explainer series and it's more about </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture criticism in terms of real life </v>

196
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.163
<v Speaker 5>contemporary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So our first episode is called was the </v>

197
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:20.924
<v Speaker 5>Internet a mistake?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're working with the amazing </v>

198
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.043
<v Speaker 5>illustrator of thug notes and I'm super </v>
<v Speaker 5>excited to be talking about current </v>

199
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:28.910
<v Speaker 5>events and talking about stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside of media.</v>

200
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.863
<v Speaker 5>We're also working on new science shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm sure you guys have seen our new </v>

201
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:33.254
<v Speaker 5>host,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Helen has been doing stuff like the </v>

202
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 5>psychology of the purge and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology of one punch man.</v>

203
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.383
<v Speaker 5>We've got more of those kinds of videos </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the works as well as Helen has been </v>

204
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:45.200
<v Speaker 5>working with a doctor at the University </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Southern California.</v>

205
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.093
<v Speaker 5>His name is Dr Jonas Kaplan and he is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>neuroscientist and he's actually giving </v>

206
00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:49.244
<v Speaker 5>us access to a neuroscience imaging </v>
<v Speaker 5>machine and we actually want to do kind </v>

207
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:53.474
<v Speaker 5>of our own experiments to see if we can </v>
<v Speaker 5>draw conclusions about how the brain </v>

208
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.364
<v Speaker 5>reacts not only to media but to various </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that we experienced on social </v>

209
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 5>media.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is kind of a dream come true for</v>

210
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:02.914
<v Speaker 5>me because I've always wanted wisecrack </v>
<v Speaker 5>to not only be about reflecting on </v>

211
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.373
<v Speaker 5>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but being a part of the research and </v>

212
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 5>studies process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're also working on a money show.</v>

213
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 5>So for those of you who listened to our </v>

<v Speaker 5>last four years and he's going to try to</v>

216
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:20.420
<v Speaker 5>get quote stupid rich by investing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff like cryptocurrencies,</v>

217

<v Speaker 5>penny stocks and possibly sex robots.</v>

218
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.840
