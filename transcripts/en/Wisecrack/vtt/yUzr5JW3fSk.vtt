<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 1>What's up wise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crack Jared again.</v>

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.963
<v Speaker 1>Now you would think that after almost 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of some of the most intense fan </v>

4
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 1>hatred ever,</v>

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 2>thumbs way down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't like,</v>

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.484
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I deserve a public apology from </v>

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 2>George Lucas.</v>

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>There'd be nothing new to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst star war,</v>

9
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.290
<v Speaker 1>the phantom menace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet here we are.</v>

10
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.363
<v Speaker 1>After the release of return of the Jedi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1983 millions of fans begged George </v>

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Lucas to create a new star wars film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studio executives begged him,</v>

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.853
<v Speaker 1>toy makers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begged him and after constantly saying </v>

13
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally in 1999 everyone got their wish.</v>

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas released the phantom </v>
<v Speaker 1>menace.</v>

15
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Problem solved except not really upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>

16
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.414
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars fans rose up in fury and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanded the head of George Lucas on a </v>

17
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>tuscan spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rallied together and aol chat rooms</v>

18
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:56.884
<v Speaker 1>and Yahoo message boards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the first time in these short </v>

19
00:00:58.871 --> 00:00:59.704
<v Speaker 1>history of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans from across the world banded </v>

20
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:02.584
<v Speaker 1>together in the righteous cause of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing George Lucas a new one for the </v>

21
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 1>unforgivable sin that was making this </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

22
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>And hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a point.</v>

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>The phantom menace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of better word,</v>

24
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.143
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>

25
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.223
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essays and videos have been written </v>

26
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>about how it sucks shadow Mr Plink it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't mind.</v>

27
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.224
<v Speaker 1>I like the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what you're stupid and why it </v>

28
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:24.424
<v Speaker 1>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much so that it has become a given </v>

29
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>that there's absolutely nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>redeemable about this movie.</v>

30
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>But what if that's not entirely true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

31
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to argue that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>chlorines were a great idea.</v>

32
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.553
<v Speaker 1>It is possible he was conceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of want to talk about what the </v>

33
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>phantom menace gets almost right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because conceptually there are some very</v>

34
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>promising themes at play here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Namely Nazis.</v>

35
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.803
<v Speaker 1>It's no secret that the original trilogy</v>
<v Speaker 1>largely wanted you to conflate the </v>

36
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.283
<v Speaker 1>empire with the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the costumes to the use of </v>

37
00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:56.494
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course naming the soldiers storm </v>

38
00:01:58.331 --> 00:01:59.164
<v Speaker 1>troopers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how did the galaxy get to be this </v>

39
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Nazi Germany,</v>

40
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>which descended into totalitarianism </v>
<v Speaker 1>through democratic means,</v>

41
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.773
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas aspired to portray </v>
<v Speaker 1>something immensely important with the </v>

42
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:11.740
<v Speaker 1>prequels.</v>

43
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.573
<v Speaker 1>How a peaceful republic can </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratically descend into full blown </v>

44
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>nazi-ism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what went wrong?</v>

45
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out.</v>

46
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack condition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>star wars.</v>

47
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Episode one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Phantom Menace.</v>

48
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

49
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>can you spoil the movie with no plot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

50
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to hear us nerd out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Disney star wars backlash,</v>

51
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>check out our special episode on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie podcast.</v>

52
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.213
<v Speaker 1>Show me the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will smash that link in the </v>

53
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>description for everyone who hasn't seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>this in over a decade.</v>

54
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.304
<v Speaker 1>Here's a brief recap and organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Trade Federation is </v>

55
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>protesting trade taxes by blockading </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade with the planet and the Boob.</v>

56
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.063
<v Speaker 1>But I guess it doesn't have to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense because really they're doing it </v>

57
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>all for their boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darth Sidious,</v>

58
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Aka Senator Palpatine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are public,</v>

59
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>a certain quiet gone gin and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentice.</v>

60
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we Kenobi to negotiate,</v>

61
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>but the trade federation tries to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

62
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.903
<v Speaker 1>They flee to the surface of Nibu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is now being invaded by the trade </v>

63
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.534
<v Speaker 1>federation and counter the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>character ever conceived in cinematic </v>

64
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:10.774
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save the Queen and try to zoom off to </v>

65
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:14.494
<v Speaker 1>the Galactic Senate where they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain what a bunch of jerks the trade </v>

66
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.764
<v Speaker 1>federation is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they get shot up and at the find </v>

67
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:20.494
<v Speaker 1>supplies on tattooing where they meet a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice slave boy with incredible force </v>

68
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some like gambling.</v>

69
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
<v Speaker 1>They liberate the boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave his mother to rot and head to the </v>

70
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.034
<v Speaker 1>Senate to plead their case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a battle quite gone dies or we </v>

71
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>won murders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darth Maul and Palpatine is now the head</v>

72
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Honcho of the Galactic Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

73
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>jar jar is a general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original trilogy,</v>

74
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:44.254
<v Speaker 1>while wonderfully enjoyable are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex works of emotional art and </v>

75
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:48.874
<v Speaker 1>they're not intended to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are updates of the flash gordon </v>

76
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>buck Rogers cereals from Lucas's </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

77
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>The heroes were good men who often were </v>
<v Speaker 1>white and the villains were evil men who</v>

78
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>often wore black just like luke </v>
<v Speaker 1>skywalker and darth vader.</v>

79
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no ambiguity here and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

80
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>The phantom menace on the other hand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite ambiguous,</v>

81
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.063
<v Speaker 1>quite gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies in cheats his way through most of </v>

82
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He as per the light side of the forest,</v>

83
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.793
<v Speaker 1>quietly meditates before his final </v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation against Darth Maul and </v>

84
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>gets wrecked.</v>

85
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Obiwan fills with rage and emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the dark side.</v>

86
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>And only then can he effectively avenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>his master,</v>

87
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>not quite the black and white morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first three films,</v>

88
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>but most notable is our benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin Queen Ahmed Dolla.</v>

89
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>She spends the phantom menace trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save her people,</v>

90
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.813
<v Speaker 1>but for all her noble intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she mostly gets manipulated by senator </v>

91
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>palpatine and even proves integral in </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting him elected supreme chancellor.</v>

92
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.093
<v Speaker 1>When good leads to victory for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've entered the realm of the morally </v>

93
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.384
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous in his essay art and moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>education philosopher Christopher </v>

94
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.273
<v Speaker 1>Hamilton expounds on the richness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>such moral ambiguity in so much as they </v>

95
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>force us to confront our own moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

96
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.843
<v Speaker 1>It's a sign of great art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did the phantom menace give us that </v>

97
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 1>gut punch that comes with us </v>
<v Speaker 1>reevaluating our own moral beliefs?</v>

98
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Of course it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

99
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.483
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt nothing all 20 times I've seen </v>

101
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:17.824
<v Speaker 1>this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ambiguity is a great idea when dealing </v>

102
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>with complex issues like political </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

103
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>trade federation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planetary autonomy,</v>

104
00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>solving humanitarian crises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why didn't it work?</v>

105
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Because the characters have no agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Author.</v>

106
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:33.424
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Wendig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has written extensively on the </v>

107
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.734
<v Speaker 1>subject defines agency and fiction as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstration of the characters ability </v>

108
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:44.521
<v Speaker 1>to make decisions and affect the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have motivations all their own.</v>

109
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>They are active more than they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive.</v>

110
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>They push the plot more than the plot </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushes on them and contrast.</v>

111
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.924
<v Speaker 1>He writes that characters without agency</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be like little paper boats </v>

112
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>bobbing down a river of your own making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot steer.</v>

113
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>They cannot change the course of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

114
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>The river is an external force that </v>
<v Speaker 1>carries them along,</v>

115
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.083
<v Speaker 1>meaning the plastics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hand up the characters cavernous </v>

116
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:07.904
<v Speaker 1>bottom hole and makes the character do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and say things in service to the </v>

117
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>plot in the phantom menace.</v>

118
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.993
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like Lucas took this rule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad writing and ran with it quite gone </v>

119
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>and Anagen and Pat May and Obi wan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God helped me judge.</v>

120
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Our banks aren't nothing but little </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper boats.</v>

121
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>They have no internal conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no external life,</v>

122
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 1>no personal obsession outside of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film dictates and that river pushing</v>

123
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>them along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>

124
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>as we later learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the dark side.</v>

125
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.613
<v Speaker 1>It does everything possible to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and the biggest casualty besides </v>

126
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>the time you and I just wasted being </v>
<v Speaker 1>bored is the political message itself.</v>

127
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>The best example of this is the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queen Amidala Pad May,</v>

128
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 1>along with many of the other characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>are mere ponds of palpatine.</v>

129
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we'll see,</v>

130
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.323
<v Speaker 1>palpatine's manipulations quickly turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>into how to cover up bad writing one on </v>

131
00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we know about pat mate.</v>

132
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>She's a queen who doesn't want to submit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some invader because,</v>

133
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what Queens do.</v>

134
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Just a likes democracy because hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not evil.</v>

135
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.703
<v Speaker 1>So in Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does a queen who likes democracy </v>

136
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>lead to the eventual downfall of said </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy?</v>

137
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>She gets manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palpatine creates a crisis on the Bu,</v>

138
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>which mirrors the prototypical false </v>
<v Speaker 1>flag attack of the Reichstag fire.</v>

139
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>And she has to plead to the Senate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene.</v>

140
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.163
<v Speaker 1>But palpatine's since he's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows their feckless bureaucrats and </v>

141
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.090
<v Speaker 1>will do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plants a seed in dollars.</v>

142
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Mind,</v>

143
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I must be frank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I just hate that isn't it'll chance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send it to will act on the Indonesian.</v>

145
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 1>She sees his warning come true.</v>

146
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.953
<v Speaker 3>This is Brad Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pint is conceited when you defer your </v>

147
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 3>motion to allow a commission to explore </v>
<v Speaker 3>the validity of your accusations</v>

148
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>calls for the supreme chancellor to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ousted</v>

149
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.390
<v Speaker 3>and is the village of no confidence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>child suffer Lauren's leadership</v>

150
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.413
<v Speaker 1>so that a real statesman can take charge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cut through the bureaucratic red </v>

151
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:11.224
<v Speaker 1>tape that real estate's been just </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to be our ambitious senator and </v>

152
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 1>future Emperor Xiv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palpatine Aka darth sidious.</v>

153
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Here's where our paper boats become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

154
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Characters without agency are well </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>

155
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.153
<v Speaker 1>But in this case of trying to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of not only how </v>

156
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:27.874
<v Speaker 1>democracy's fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how well meaning people are </v>

157
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:30.814
<v Speaker 1>implicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper wrote characters rob us of our </v>

158
00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 1>ability to reflect on what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

159
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Beat for beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

160
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Palpatine warrants or of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She sees his warning come true,</v>

161
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.810
<v Speaker 1>so she falls for the deception and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds good,</v>

162
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.320
<v Speaker 1>but maybe because Lucas was too busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>cramming in 8,000</v>

163
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.990
<v Speaker 1>dumb lines for this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it falls flat.</v>

164
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.393
<v Speaker 1>Each beat could have confronted our </v>
<v Speaker 1>character with a choice they might </v>

165
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>deliberate over with or at least talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this choice.</v>

166
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>She might argue with Palpatine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she might confide in a friend,</v>

167
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>she might reach out to an outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>government for help.</v>

168
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>She might deny palpatine's bargain at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all costs and Toba toll on her citizenry</v>

169
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>gets too high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the phantom menace,</v>

170
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>things just kind of happen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is a pawn,</v>

171
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.843
<v Speaker 1>not a person with agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that destroys our ability as the </v>

172
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:18.894
<v Speaker 1>audience to reflect on these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we identify with the characters we </v>

173
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>identify would their dilemma asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

174
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.273
<v Speaker 1>what would I do when in the dark knight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joker rigs to boats with explosives </v>

175
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:30.774
<v Speaker 1>to give each one the power to obliterate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other before they get obliterated </v>

176
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:34.194
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

177
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blow you all alone,</v>

178
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.730
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>presses the button.</v>

179
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll let that though.</v>

180
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.703
<v Speaker 1>We bite our nails as we debate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>merits of killing someone else to save </v>

181
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:46.454
<v Speaker 1>our own skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no such tension in the phantom </v>

182
00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>menace because pat may is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>palpatine's puppet.</v>

183
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And what's the deal with the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>senators?</v>

184
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.120
<v Speaker 1>What are their motivations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

185
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.330
<v Speaker 1>We're just hold when and how they side </v>
<v Speaker 1>with palpatine.</v>

186
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.493
<v Speaker 1>And to make matters worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at no point does pad may regret the </v>

187
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:03.824
<v Speaker 1>decision that would eventually destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy in the phantom menace or in </v>

188
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:07.544
<v Speaker 1>the later movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If her initial decision to remove the </v>

189
00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:13.550
<v Speaker 1>supreme chancellor from power gives us </v>
<v Speaker 1>no room to empathize and think.</v>

190
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>At least we can empathize and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her regret.</v>

191
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.370
<v Speaker 1>But no for a woman who later says this,</v>

192
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 4>so this is how it appears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He dies and their supplies,</v>

193
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.343
<v Speaker 1>you might at least expect her to sob </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly in some corner because she </v>

194
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>literally made this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By contrast,</v>

195
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>consider Jamie lannister from game of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrones.</v>

196
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.373
<v Speaker 1>He was a loyal guard to the mad king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zapped when the mad king tried to </v>

197
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:42.321
<v Speaker 1>incinerate all of his citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie broke his sacred oath and murdered</v>

198
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 1>the person he swore to protect.</v>

199
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Then the king drove my soldiers back.</v>

200
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.933
<v Speaker 1>Jamie is haunted by this decision as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's derisively called Kinsler for the </v>

201
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 1>rest of his life and while he probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the right choice,</v>

202
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>he's also acutely aware that he is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>or less responsible for the current show</v>

203
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:03.594
<v Speaker 1>in Westeros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes responsibility for the choices </v>

204
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:06.804
<v Speaker 1>he made and that allows us to identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him or we can even look at rogue </v>

205
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>one where a good characters involvement </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the creation of the death star is put</v>

206
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.194
<v Speaker 1>front and center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does this lack of agency rob </v>

207
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>meaning from the how democracy dies </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme in the phantom menace,</v>

208
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes all of Lucas's topical</v>
<v Speaker 1>and timely takes on news of the decade,</v>

209
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:26.904
<v Speaker 1>more or less meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phantom menace came out in the late </v>

210
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.973
<v Speaker 1>nineties just years after governments in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bosnia and Rwanda had committed </v>

211
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the queen of Nobu is pleading to</v>

212
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>an international,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean interplanetary government body to</v>

213
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 1>intervene in the slaughter for people.</v>

214
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas inspiration was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious on a narrative level.</v>

215
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:46.794
<v Speaker 1>Do we care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really vague shout outs to current </v>

216
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:52.570
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't a good political allegory make you</v>

217
00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 1>need choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

218
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>we understand it as just another step in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palpatine's greater machinations.</v>

219
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.493
<v Speaker 1>When the Senate fails to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand their motivations </v>

220
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:03.184
<v Speaker 1>for doing so or their personal failings </v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from a line or two from palpatine </v>

221
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:07.354
<v Speaker 1>describing them as an effectual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the trade federation </v>

222
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.863
<v Speaker 1>talk of taxes and trade in the opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawl was likely meant to invoke </v>

223
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>contemporary debates about globalization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and free trade,</v>

224
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.283
<v Speaker 1>right on the heels of Nafta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was passed in 1994 and anti </v>

225
00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>globalization protests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does the Trade Federation want?</v>

226
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Why did the Senate passed taxes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade?</v>

227
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.543
<v Speaker 1>Who The f knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also worth noting that aside from </v>

228
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:30.694
<v Speaker 1>the political themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters getting pushed along the </v>

229
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>narrative stream with no choice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

230
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.943
<v Speaker 1>In the case of George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our heat literally succeeds via </v>

231
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:38.764
<v Speaker 1>incompetence in the battle of Nobu,</v>
