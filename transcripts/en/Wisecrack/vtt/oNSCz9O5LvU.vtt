<v Speaker 1>starring stand up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>turned comedic,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's no meaning dynamics slim carry.</v>

11
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>The film follows lovable human male </v>
<v Speaker 1>Truman,</v>

12
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>burbank who knows a thing or two about </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensible sweaters.</v>

13
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.283
<v Speaker 1>What he doesn't know is that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually on a reality show because who </v>

14
00:00:56.111 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 1>needs writers line his town was a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

15
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>His town is a movie set and keeping with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood tradition.</v>

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freaking up.</v>

17
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:07.234
<v Speaker 1>This freak show is tortured artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>khristopher tortured because he wears a </v>

18
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>bra to ensure truman doesn't get any </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy ideas like swimming.</v>

19
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.693
<v Speaker 1>He makes Truman's dad drink too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flash forward to the college years </v>

20
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>season where Truman falls for a sexy </v>
<v Speaker 1>librarian,</v>

21
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>actress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after some flirtatious running,</v>

22
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>she tells him those three little words </v>
<v Speaker 1>every guy wants to hear.</v>

23
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Everything's alive before Truman can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

24
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you too.</v>

25
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Production intervenes and whisks her </v>
<v Speaker 1>away to the h,</v>

26
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>two o company Fiji inconsolable beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

27
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.513
<v Speaker 1>Truman marries the next person he sees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Truman can't get her out of his </v>

28
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so khristopher tries.</v>

29
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Bird Manningham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it only makes things worse.</v>

30
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure how it could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped.</v>

31
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.163
<v Speaker 1>Truman starts noticing that his dead dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks a lot like the town's only </v>

32
00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:57.154
<v Speaker 1>homeless guy and more alarmingly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has canceled his Sirius xm </v>

33
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>before you can say blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

34
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:03.644
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Truman skipping town until </v>

35
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Khristopher pulls the old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a nuclear explosion,</v>

36
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 1>so this one road is closed trick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like all my family road trips,</v>

37
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.563
<v Speaker 1>it ends in divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Truman does his best Saddam </v>

38
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>impression and hides when the network </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't find him.</v>

39
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.923
<v Speaker 1>They start a human hunt cut transmission</v>
<v Speaker 1>and air reruns of technical </v>

40
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:23.854
<v Speaker 1>difficulties.</v>

41
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Khristopher loses a ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but immediately finds Truman on it.</v>

42
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.533
<v Speaker 1>He makes it rain if you catch my drift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since HBO still holds the rights to </v>

43
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>violent death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stopped the storm and Truman breaks</v>

44
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:35.944
<v Speaker 1>the fourth wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truman tries to punch his way through </v>

45
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:39.784
<v Speaker 1>for a hot sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but gives up and goes for the fire exit </v>

46
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but khristopher has another trick up his</v>

47
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>sleeve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely a Samsung Galaxy note.</v>

48
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.440
<v Speaker 1>He fires up the PA system that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there the whole time.</v>

49
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I can hear you and asks Truman back for </v>
<v Speaker 1>six more seasons in a movie,</v>

50
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but Truman's agents are sharks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the nature of the Biz.</v>

51
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.123
<v Speaker 1>The Truman show begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what extent are recovered by some </v>

52
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>unseen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all powerful force,</v>

53
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>otherwise known as Disney's the force </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Truman.</v>

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.543
<v Speaker 1>It's the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A state referred to as the illogical </v>

55
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.364
<v Speaker 1>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why you got to put a label on </v>

56
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every aspect of Truman's life,</v>

57
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>from what he eats and where's is </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by Khristopher.</v>

58
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.073
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher's name is a variation on </v>

59
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Christ as in Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through most of the film,</v>

61
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Truman struggles to free himself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system and make his own choices,</v>

62
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>only to find offers flashmob poised and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to dance.</v>

63
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>The film frames this age old debate in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century context,</v>

64
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>when most human lives were controlled by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>

65
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>instead of the chips inside their </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains,</v>

66
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.853
<v Speaker 1>Truman is literally owned by a studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>well until the right to revert back to </v>

67
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.484
<v Speaker 1>marvel has last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burbank is a nod to the California and </v>

68
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>city where the Warner Bros used to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>keg stands.</v>

69
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.843
<v Speaker 1>As we watch truman get ushered from </v>
<v Speaker 1>product to product by subtle </v>

70
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:00.994
<v Speaker 1>advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't help but notice the same </v>

71
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>attempts by the media to groom our </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

72
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>That is a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I would ever tell you to buy.</v>

73
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Kill Mo's eyebrow wax on sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for 6,000</v>

74
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Garba trons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wouldn't.</v>

75
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Truman's journey to discover the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>resembles the thought experiment,</v>

76
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.360
<v Speaker 1>the allegory of the cave by plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

77
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:21.194
<v Speaker 1>Spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The experiment imagines humans chained </v>

78
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>to a wall only knowing shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more popularly known as a sex dungeon.</v>

79
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Truman's worldview is similarly </v>
<v Speaker 1>constrained,</v>

80
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.563
<v Speaker 1>is cave is sea haven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actors are his shadows and his hair </v>

81
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>is just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato's oppose that.</v>

82
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Once a prisoner ditched the cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would prefer the outside world to the</v>

83
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Khristopher disagrees,</v>

84
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I think what distresses you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately Truman prefers his cell,</v>

85
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but as the film climaxes Truman calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a liar,</v>

86
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.474
<v Speaker 1>liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His perseverance to retire from Showbiz </v>

87
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:58.324
<v Speaker 1>is reminiscent of Captain Ahab's classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle with moby penis symbolically </v>

88
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>representing the struggle between </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind and God,</v>

89
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the novel ends and a good old fashion </v>
<v Speaker 1>drowning,</v>

90
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.403
<v Speaker 1>whereas Truman's ends and breathing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final frames suggests that humans had </v>

91
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:18.121
<v Speaker 1>the will to control their own destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was true until president and Kylie</v>

92
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Jenner found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth link cinema.</v>

96

<v Speaker 3>It took a lot of highly skilled people </v>

97
