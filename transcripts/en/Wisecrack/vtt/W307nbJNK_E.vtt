00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecracks and share it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might've noticed that we have a soft</v>

2
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>spot for cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irreverent,</v>

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.243
<v Speaker 1>and even nihilist comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've recently been wondering is </v>

4
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:15.444
<v Speaker 1>there anything on the other side of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>current cynicism is comedy based and </v>

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>earnestness and genuine human emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>still possible?</v>

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>To answer this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're turning to our friend Bo Burnham,</v>

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.823
<v Speaker 1>a comedian who might have cracked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>code for how to embrace all the </v>

8
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>intellectual goodness of postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>irony</v>

9
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 2>while</v>

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>offering something with a real human </v>
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.433
<v Speaker 1>Could we get the house lights up for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second and could you put the lights on </v>

12
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the artifice fade away.</v>

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.443
<v Speaker 1>Now we're all the same like a candy bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a hard shell of cultural </v>

14
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:47.894
<v Speaker 1>cynicism on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a warm hug from your favorite aunt </v>

15
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though Burnham is still baby faced,</v>

16
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>his work has actually gone through a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct stages.</v>

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.673
<v Speaker 1>While his earliest work incorporates </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern cynicism and ironic </v>

18
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:01.034
<v Speaker 1>detachment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I adopted a child from overseas to </v>

19
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:04.724
<v Speaker 1>rescue him from child labor factories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and on his very first birthday we went </v>

20
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:13.541
<v Speaker 1>to build a bear workshop is more recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

21
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Not only exposes the meaningless core of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary life,</v>

22
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.103
<v Speaker 1>but also attempts to offer a corrective </v>
<v Speaker 1>with introspection and a search for </v>

23
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.394
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a scale from one to zero are you </v>

24
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>happy?</v>

25
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.853
<v Speaker 1>Burnham might be the rare comedic figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to offer salvation from the empty </v>

26
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>cultural wasteland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is our modern world.</v>

27
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.173
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this wisecrack condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the philosophy of Bo Burnham and I </v>

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:39.314
<v Speaker 1>guess spoilers part one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did we get here to understand why </v>

29
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Burnham represents such an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift in comedy?</v>

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>We first need to see how comedy arrived </v>
<v Speaker 1>at its postmodern era,</v>

31
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.383
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is even meant by </v>

32
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:52.964
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phrase become so amorphous that it </v>

33
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>can be used to describe everything from </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars to Scottish beer,</v>

34
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.133
<v Speaker 1>but a more helpful understanding can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>found in the work of Fredrick Jamison </v>

35
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>who's work describes postmodernism as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cultural logic of late capitalism,</v>

36
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.923
<v Speaker 1>which means that each new form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic life creates a related form of </v>

37
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>cultural life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

38
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.493
<v Speaker 1>when you're a poor college student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your economic situation dictates a </v>

39
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>cultural life of cheap beers.</v>

40
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.803
<v Speaker 1>Movies in a dorm room and paying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar cheesy rollups with your laundry </v>

41
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:26.210
<v Speaker 1>quarters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you graduate and get a job,</v>

42
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.103
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking a locally made IPA </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying $20 for a movie ticket and using </v>

43
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>your debit card for a cheesy Gordita </v>
<v Speaker 1>crunch.</v>

44
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.183
<v Speaker 1>A few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sell your app flush finder that </v>

45
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:36.854
<v Speaker 1>gives you a map of the cleanest public </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilets near you and you'll be drinking </v>

46
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>aged whiskey sitting court side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending your scared assistant,</v>

47
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Adrian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grab you a crunchwrap Supreme Combo.</v>

48
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.203
<v Speaker 1>Each economic stage in your life leads </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a new cultural stage and </v>

49
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:51.074
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism is the cultural logic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the current stage of economic </v>

50
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which jamison calls late capitalism.</v>

51
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see how Jamison's ideas can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us understand me shifting trends in</v>

52
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:01.834
<v Speaker 1>American comedy over the past 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do this with a three step </v>

53
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:05.854
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economic Culture leads to popular </v>

54
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads to comedy.</v>

55
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's start in the fifties America is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a post war boom.</v>

56
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>The Gi bill has led to record numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>college grads and homeowners.</v>

57
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.943
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get a middle class job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba is just a quaint island of resorts </v>

58
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:22.204
<v Speaker 1>and cocktails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This era's popular culture is all about </v>

59
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>optimism and enjoyment.</v>

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing up here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were downstairs.</v>

61
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Backs and chocolate all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kicked me out of there fast.</v>

62
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I kept pinching them to see what kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were</v>

63
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.030
<v Speaker 1>and their comedy sensibility can be seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in someone like Jack Benny.</v>

64
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.013
<v Speaker 2>Congratulation bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you would just shine when appeal of </v>

65
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:42.474
<v Speaker 2>a day data</v>

66
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>by the mid sixties the boom time is </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

67
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>The Cold War has people on edge and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war is on the horizon.</v>

68
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.233
<v Speaker 1>There were protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naked hippies and someone gave the </v>

69
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LSD.</v>

70
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.493
<v Speaker 1>The counterculture had snuck into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular culture and Lenny Bruce is on </v>

71
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>trial for obscenities while George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlin is listing</v>

72
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.853
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

73
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.123
<v Speaker 1>by the 80s Reagan had promised endless </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth and we've got cable TV </v>

74
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:08.674
<v Speaker 1>to keep us company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 seven new media creates the </v>

75
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for a new read of superstar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wild.</v>

76
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson sold out arenas with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

77
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy did the same with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>

78
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing is how fly they</v>
<v Speaker 1>look and red leather jacket.</v>

79
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.203
<v Speaker 3>It's in the nineties Comedians like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Romano had gone </v>

80
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 3>from successful standups to television </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>

81
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.193
<v Speaker 3>How many was more mainstream than ever?</v>
<v Speaker 3>MTV giant cell phones and economic </v>

82
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 3>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bounded and all the while.</v>

83
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 3>How many rode this wave with a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimism and increasingly goofy spirit.</v>

84
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>We're not worthy,</v>

85
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>but just like Taco bell's Nacho fries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things can't last forever.</v>

86
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>And by the dawn of the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.com</v>

87
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.214
<v Speaker 1>bubble had burst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Limp Biscuit was popular and nine 11 </v>

88
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.394
<v Speaker 1>left the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wondering if anything could be funny </v>

89
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:56.764
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

90
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Can we be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why start now?</v>

91
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>As the aughts rolled on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things didn't get much better.</v>

92
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>The 2008 financial crisis was the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the great depression and the weird</v>

93
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>scrubs reboot left us all wondering if </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing was sacred anymore.</v>

94
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Part too</v>

95
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.533
<v Speaker 3>comedy as cultural cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the political and economic cynicism of </v>

96
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 3>the oughts led to a new form of cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>cynicism in the media</v>

97
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 2>design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I never was alone.</v>

98
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>If you don't go squeeze on her day.</v>

99
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.973
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly known for its groundbreaking </v>

100
00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:33.200
<v Speaker 3>character prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>

101
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing about prison was the was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dementors.</v>

102
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.624
<v Speaker 2>They were flying all over the place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was scary and then they'd come down </v>

103
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>and they suck the soul out of your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it height.</v>

104
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.813
<v Speaker 3>The office showed us the mundane and </v>
<v Speaker 3>often meaningless existence of the </v>

105
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:47.324
<v Speaker 3>American worker and the rest of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>division was slowly taken over by </v>

106
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 3>reality shows that we're all completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake,</v>

107
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 3>but nobody seemed to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most recent shifts that helps</v>

108
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:57.524
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The effect of late capitalism on comedy </v>

109
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.230
<v Speaker 3>is what we're calling the adult swim </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

110
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.453
<v Speaker 3>What started as a way for cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 3>network to get stoners to watch their </v>

111
00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Speaker 3>channel while eating double decker tacos</v>
<v Speaker 3>has since become the home of some of the</v>

112
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:10.414
<v Speaker 3>weirdest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most absurd and most intentionally </v>

113
00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 3>cringeworthy comedy to hit the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>Airways.</v>

114
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Tim and Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome show,</v>

115
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:20.304
<v Speaker 3>great job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed us a surreal and absurdist </v>

116
00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 3>version of the upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

117
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.843
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to put a good Eric Andre </v>
<v Speaker 3>ironically occupied the space of the </v>

118
00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:29.754
<v Speaker 3>late night host,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show how meaningless the late night </v>

119
00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:35.340
<v Speaker 3>model had become while using interviews </v>
<v Speaker 3>with c list celebrities.</v>

120
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 3>The highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vapid nature of it,</v>

121
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.170
<v Speaker 3>contemporary fame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Neighbors House has recently shown us</v>

122
00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:41.004
<v Speaker 3>what happens when Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogers has put through the postmodern </v>

123
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 3>cynicism filter.</v>

124
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.033
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what the color and when you </v>

125
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 2>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hurt your brother.</v>

126
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.223
<v Speaker 3>And of course our friends rick and morty</v>
<v Speaker 3>give us an animated response to the </v>

127
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.614
<v Speaker 3>classic philosophical question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if back to the future was an r </v>

128
00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 3>rated movie involving the multiverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilism.</v>

129
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing you think matters,</v>

130
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:06.150
<v Speaker 3>matters and lots of brown liquor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many of these shows weren't even funny,</v>

131
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:06.984
<v Speaker 3>at least in the traditional sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas the 90s and early aughts used </v>

132
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:12.930
<v Speaker 3>canned laughter to tell our lizard </v>
<v Speaker 3>brains when to laugh.</v>

133
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.830
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

134
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.793
<v Speaker 3>Eric Andre used canned laughter to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create an uncomfortable moment for all </v>

135
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:19.454
<v Speaker 3>involved</v>

136
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.983
<v Speaker 2>to hear about this.</v>

137
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Andre just wants to push the </v>
<v Speaker 3>limits of what we'll watch or maybe he's</v>

138
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:29.880
<v Speaker 3>asking you if there's even such a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>as authentic comedy anymore.</v>

139
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.740
<v Speaker 3>We only know one thing's for sure about.</v>

140
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.773
<v Speaker 2>You've got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lettuce is just straight up eat the </v>

141
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:39.064
<v Speaker 2>lettuce</v>

142
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 3>at the same time that adult swim is </v>
<v Speaker 3>blossoming.</v>

143
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.733
<v Speaker 3>Occupy Wall Street is taking over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>streets of Manhattan and young people </v>

144
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 3>around the world are questioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic and political institutions in a</v>

145
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 3>way that would make the mug covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hippies proud,</v>

146
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.933
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like their forefathers Linnaean </v>
<v Speaker 3>and George who used political cynicism </v>

147
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 3>to infuse their comedy with an urgency </v>
<v Speaker 3>for truth.</v>

148
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Got No steel industry left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can educate our young people,</v>

149
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:02.514
<v Speaker 2>can't get healthcare to our old people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can bomb the shit out of your </v>

150
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:05.560
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

151
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.393
<v Speaker 4>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

152
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.493
<v Speaker 3>Don't swim generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let this cynicism go from a rallying </v>

153
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:11.704
<v Speaker 3>cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This cynicism for cynicism safe rather </v>

154
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:14.884
<v Speaker 3>than a response to a troubled world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This cynicism denied the existence of </v>

155
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.710
<v Speaker 3>real meaning or truth in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

156
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Just say summit again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it don't matter,</v>

157
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 2>but not of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison</v>

158
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.910
<v Speaker 3>do return to the fourth meal of cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>

159
00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:27.744
<v Speaker 3>Fredrick Jamison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This cynical comedy is a perfect </v>

160
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 3>exemplification of postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same cultural form repeats,</v>

161
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 3>but this time with iron ore to </v>
<v Speaker 3>paraphrase marks first as Johnny Carson,</v>

162
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.223
<v Speaker 3>ben is Eric Andre eating his own vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cynicism and irony led to a brand of </v>

163
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:51.041
<v Speaker 3>comedy in which truth meaning and human </v>
<v Speaker 3>earnestness are just useless relics from</v>

164
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 3>the era of canned laughter and Pesky New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York mothers.</v>

165
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 3>So are we now in this postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback loop of meaninglessness?</v>

166
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to find out we have to return to our</v>

167
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 3>friend Beau.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

168
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 3>The other one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's pretty,</v>

169
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.240
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

170
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Not The obamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Portuguese water dog.</v>

171
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 3>The comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lanky white guy in his twenties yes.</v>

172
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Finally Jesus.</v>

173
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Three from irony to sincerity in Bo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham,</v>

174
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>our guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we keep going,</v>

175
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.330
<v Speaker 1>real charity here for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you guys know,</v>

176
00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:24.610
<v Speaker 1>we sometimes talk about pretty heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>

177
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Cynicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nihilism avoids a meaning.</v>

178
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.440
<v Speaker 1>You know the drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these topics can be,</v>

179
00:09:29.441 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>to put it bluntly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bumper.</v>

180
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I want to talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video sponsored for better help,</v>

181
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.900
<v Speaker 1>a counseling service that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with licensed therapists on your</v>

182
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:38.980
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tablet,</v>

183
00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:41.680
<v Speaker 1>or mobile phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually tried the service myself,</v>

184
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:42.514
<v Speaker 1>so wait till the end of the video to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear more about my experience until </v>

185
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:46.690
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to better help.com/wise</v>

186
00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:49.450
<v Speaker 1>crack to get started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now back to Bo.</v>

187
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.583
<v Speaker 1>Bo Burnham is an interesting case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much of his early work was shaped by </v>

188
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:56.230
<v Speaker 1>the influence of Dutch absurdist haunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tailwind,</v>

189
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.780
<v Speaker 5>where have you been in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For what?</v>

190
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea</v>

191
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.043
<v Speaker 1>and embodied eighth attach irony which </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplified the tenants of postmodern </v>

192
00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:09.910
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

193
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.570
<v Speaker 6>Jesus can walk on water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you swim on land</v>

194
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 1>because there is no fixed standard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth or meaning.</v>

195
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Burnham used comedy to point the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience to the slack.</v>

196
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Jesus</v>

197
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.630
<v Speaker 6>wasn't the Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get back on the herons again.</v>

198
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm on fire with the head of past those </v>
<v Speaker 6>holy nights stuff.</v>

199
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 6>Holy mother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right</v>

200
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.393
<v Speaker 1>in his recent work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham pushes back against the </v>

201
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.094
<v Speaker 1>emptiness of postmodernism in an attempt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find genuine meaning in things like </v>

202
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.504
<v Speaker 1>love and happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say that rather than returning </v>

203
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>back to ava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern perspective,</v>

204
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.333
<v Speaker 1>Burnham pushes through postmodernism to </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrive at a post postmodern perspective </v>

205
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.223
<v Speaker 1>where the death of traditional meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an opportunity for the creation of </v>

206
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:49.944
<v Speaker 1>new meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see his progression by </v>

207
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:52.494
<v Speaker 1>considering his three specials as three </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct stages in his comedic </v>

208
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 1>development is first special words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

209
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>words explores the death of art and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

210
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.853
<v Speaker 1>The followup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what goes a step further and operates </v>

211
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>under the principle that meaning itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>is dead and his most recent special make</v>

212
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 1>happy works through the death of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an attempt to see if real meaning and</v>

213
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 1>happiness are still possible from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening minutes of words,</v>

214
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

215
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Burnham aims to show the audience the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facade of entertainment.</v>

216
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.810
<v Speaker 6>It's all an illusion and I'm wearing may</v>
<v Speaker 6>God I'm wearing may got bay Guy Burnham</v>

217
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>art is dead because it's really just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>means for something else.</v>

218
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.743
<v Speaker 1>So people think you're funny how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get those people's mind and true to the </v>

219
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:34.044
<v Speaker 1>logic of late capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real purpose of art is simply </v>

220
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:37.254
<v Speaker 1>creating opportunities for making more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and presumably eating Nacho </v>

221
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:41.251
<v Speaker 1>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doritos,</v>

222
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:42.084
<v Speaker 1>locos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supreme's whenever you want and when he </v>

223
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>speculates on what the forefathers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter cultural comedy would think.</v>

224
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>His conclusion isn't pretty.</v>

225
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.510
<v Speaker 6>We're rolling in dough out car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lana rose eight is gray.</v>

226
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 6>His array by pointing</v>

227
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>to the death of art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham shows how comedy has just become</v>

228
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:58.174
<v Speaker 1>a way for charming narcissist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make as much money as they can with no </v>

229
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 1>imperative for authenticity or truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If words,</v>

230
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:05.314
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words is Burnham's eulogy for the death </v>

231
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.384
<v Speaker 1>of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes a step further in what and </v>

232
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>mourns the death of truth and meaning as</v>
<v Speaker 1>such,</v>

233
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 1>artist alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like Israel.</v>

234
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>And he's aware that in the context of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's actual problems,</v>

235
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>laughter isn't the medicine we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold.</v>

236
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.553
<v Speaker 6>That's it last towards the key to </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything is the way to solve all the </v>

237
00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:26.240
<v Speaker 6>sadness in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

238
00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 6>not for the people that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>stabbed,</v>

239
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.750
<v Speaker 6>but the people like us that got to deal </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them all the time.</v>

240
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.793
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the adult swim comedians burden </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just embrace the chaos that </v>

241
00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:35.054
<v Speaker 1>comes from the depth of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's asking what it means for us when </v>

242
00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:38.400
<v Speaker 1>meaning dies.</v>

243
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 6>None of you are go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

244
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and asking whether or not the creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning is possible.</v>

245
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.090
<v Speaker 6>Maybe the life on earth could be have.</v>

246
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.823
<v Speaker 1>He has no conclusive answer in what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lets us sit in that space of not </v>

247
00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>

248
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.553
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>

249
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.033
<v Speaker 1>What is the point where he starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that comedy devoid of the </v>

250
00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:11.160
<v Speaker 1>aspirations of any higher meeting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just an equine atm.</v>

251
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.053
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll stop beating this dead horse when </v>

252
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:15.900
<v Speaker 6>it stops spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now</v>

253
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>make happy represents Burnham's attempt </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use comedy not just for criticism,</v>

254
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.953
<v Speaker 1>but as a vehicle to search for meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he makes clear early on at his </v>

255
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>comedy is not a mode of escapism.</v>

256
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.613
<v Speaker 7>You are here because you want to laugh </v>
<v Speaker 7>and you want to forget about your </v>

257
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:37.360
<v Speaker 7>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I cannot allow it.</v>

258
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.873
<v Speaker 7>You should not mind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should not forget about your </v>

259
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:44.014
<v Speaker 7>problems.</v>

260
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.953
<v Speaker 1>Instead of escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham tries to use comedy as an </v>

261
00:13:46.731 --> 00:13:47.564
<v Speaker 1>occasion for the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jukes truly encountered their problems </v>

262
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.983
<v Speaker 1>and maybe themselves in the process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less you underestimate Burnham's desire </v>

263
00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:55.460
<v Speaker 1>to make you think about some real shit.</v>

264
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.830
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

265
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.663
<v Speaker 7>The world is not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>12% of the world's population does not </v>

266
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:06.471
<v Speaker 7>have access to clean drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The world is not funny guy fee area owns</v>

267
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:09.990
<v Speaker 7>two functioning restaurants</v>

268
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.323
<v Speaker 1>and while he has some facts wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verdomme doesn't want to use culture as </v>

269
00:14:14.181 --> 00:14:15.014
<v Speaker 1>a way to escape reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of Jamison's worries about </v>

270
00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:18.584
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism that it removes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative for us to be critical about </v>

271
00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:22.424
<v Speaker 1>the world around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a server who lets you know that </v>

272
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:25.784
<v Speaker 1>he's upselling you on donkey sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because it's good but because it </v>

273
00:14:28.251 --> 00:14:29.084
<v Speaker 1>will make him money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham lets us peek behind the </v>

274
00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:34.460
<v Speaker 1>comedians curtain entertainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are lying and they are manipulating</v>

275
00:14:34.461 --> 00:14:35.294
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not all harsh reality for Burnham </v>

276
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:40.400
<v Speaker 1>though as he thinks the move past </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism has some upside.</v>

277
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>We all deserve even on the days when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in our past cause we all suck.</v>

278
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Love can make a suck less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul deserve love.</v>

279
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the very best part of being an I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would know.</v>

280
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I just turned 20</v>

281
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.523
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

282
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And by adding that last line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he undercuts his own point,</v>

283
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.163
<v Speaker 1>showing us a position that straddles the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line between naive optimism and ironic </v>

284
00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:17.454
<v Speaker 1>cynicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show ends with Bo Burnham's take on </v>

285
00:15:19.111 --> 00:15:23.070
<v Speaker 1>a Kanye West concert circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 cannot say much</v>

286
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 9>New York cannot see much.</v>

287
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.230
<v Speaker 1>While it might start off with jokes,</v>

288
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.883
<v Speaker 6>listen to the people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure 90% of the complaint letters </v>

289
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 6>you get are about the width of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>cans.</v>

290
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 6>Just make them wider.</v>

291
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.590
<v Speaker 1>He peppers this confession with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>more vulnerable moment.</v>

292
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 6>Don't go to the gym because I'm self </v>
<v Speaker 6>conscious about my body,</v>

293
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 6>but I'm self conscious about my body </v>
<v Speaker 6>cause that don't go to the gym</v>

294
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.540
<v Speaker 1>and he closes out with what seems like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine wish for his audience.</v>

295
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Good night.</v>

296
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.843
<v Speaker 8>I hope you're happy</v>

297
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.463
<v Speaker 1>with make happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham hearkens back to the socratic </v>

298
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>tendencies from comedians in a previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>era,</v>

299
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.363
<v Speaker 1>much like the gadfly of Athens himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham is urging his audience to truly </v>

300
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:17.684
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unhappiness as the unexamined life </v>

301
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>is not worth living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like aristotle,</v>

302
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 1>his final words imply that happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be possible,</v>

303
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.283
<v Speaker 1>but we have to work at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's most interesting is that Burnham </v>

304
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 1>doesn't simply reject postmodern comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of something new.</v>

305
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pushes postmodern comedy to its limit</v>

306
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.513
<v Speaker 1>to see what's on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over the course of these three </v>

307
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:41.024
<v Speaker 1>specials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see him transition from irony to </v>

308
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:43.574
<v Speaker 1>cynicism to earnestness or from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of art to the depth of meaning to </v>

309
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of meaningful art after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of me.</v>

310
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Art For comedy as a cure for despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is Rick Sanchez right now,</v>

311
00:16:55.721 --> 00:16:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what even burden thinks we should try</v>

312
00:16:58.931 --> 00:16:59.680
<v Speaker 1>to be happy?</v>

313
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.513
<v Speaker 1>We live in a world where goodness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth seem increasingly illusory and in </v>

314
00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:08.200
<v Speaker 1>a world where Nacho fries aren't even on</v>
<v Speaker 1>most Taco bell man use anymore.</v>

315
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it even worth moving past postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism?</v>

316
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.913
<v Speaker 1>One telling factor is that Burnham isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one trying to inject a post </v>

317
00:17:15.581 --> 00:17:16.414
<v Speaker 1>postmodern sincerity back into comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great example is the most critically </v>

318
00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:22.660
<v Speaker 1>successful comedy film of 2017 the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>

319
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.130
<v Speaker 1>which coincidentally stars Burnham as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian obsessed with success and while</v>

320
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:31.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a genuinely funny movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it explores family success and love with</v>

321
00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:34.960
<v Speaker 1>a sincerity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not common in comedy films and it's safe</v>

322
00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:38.460
<v Speaker 1>to guests that the inclusion of Ray </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romano isn't a coincidence as receive.</v>

323
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.303
<v Speaker 1>The cranky set calmed out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties portraying a complicated and </v>

324
00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:45.520
<v Speaker 1>compassionate human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've also seen this shift from irony to</v>

325
00:17:45.521 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>sincerity in shows like Nathan for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the ones I do get</v>

326
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 10>you guys in a part of me is envious that</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know I don't have someone in my life</v>

327
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 10>that is unless close with</v>

328
00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.283
<v Speaker 1>and infusing absurdity with a story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about genuine adult friendship in </v>

329
00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Detroit and even one of the darkest </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows out there.</v>

330
00:18:07.311 --> 00:18:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Bojack horseman explores the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of finding real meaning.</v>

331
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.893
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to realize how </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly miserable you are and even longer </v>

332
00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:16.760
<v Speaker 1>to see that it doesn't have to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

333
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Only after you give up everything can </v>
<v Speaker 1>you begin to find a way to be happy.</v>

334
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.893
<v Speaker 1>While Fredrick Jamison has yet to offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>an analysis of the way in which comedy </v>

335
00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:29.450
<v Speaker 1>can cure the cultural illness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>

336
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.403
<v Speaker 1>It might just be the case that Burnham's</v>
<v Speaker 1>work is telling us something about what </v>

337
00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:36.110
<v Speaker 1>will happen on the other side of late </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>

338
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crunchwrap supreme is here to stay.</v>

339
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Speaker 1>So maybe there are eternal truths that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can all still believe in.</v>

340
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.083
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crunchwrap supreme is can't solve all </v>

341
00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:47.300
<v Speaker 1>your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

342
00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:48.134
<v Speaker 1>I've tried seriously though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are real ways to help with life </v>

343
00:18:50.571 --> 00:18:51.350
<v Speaker 1>struggles.</v>

344
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.240
<v Speaker 1>So this video is sponsored by better </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

345
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I actually tried out the service myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke with a certified therapist named</v>

346
00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:57.494
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer and it was really pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was as good or better than any </v>

347
00:19:00.651 --> 00:19:01.484
<v Speaker 1>therapist I've seen in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with better helping them communicate </v>

348
00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:06.140
<v Speaker 1>with the counselor via message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live chat,</v>

349
00:19:06.141 --> 00:19:07.910
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or video conferencing,</v>

350
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you can do therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're in the pool,</v>

351
00:19:10.071 --> 00:19:13.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're walking your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever is most productive for you.</v>

352
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.730
<v Speaker 1>So what I liked the most about better </v>
<v Speaker 1>health is that it's accessible.</v>

353
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:17.803
<v Speaker 1>People who normally wouldn't seek out </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy or don't even know how to go </v>

354
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:22.880
<v Speaker 1>about getting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get access quickly.</v>

355
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.900
<v Speaker 1>It's also convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes when people do decide to seek</v>

356
00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:27.734
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only because they're at a really </v>

357
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:31.580
<v Speaker 1>low point in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already desperate.</v>

358
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.533
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in that state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last thing you want to do is jump </v>

359
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:37.430
<v Speaker 1>through insurance hoops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing who's in and out of your network</v>

360
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.473
<v Speaker 1>or who don't go through all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying exorbitant amounts or having to </v>

361
00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:43.490
<v Speaker 1>deal with stacks of paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case.</v>

362
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:44.324
<v Speaker 1>With better help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are matched within 24 hours and </v>

363
00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it's completely confidential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So better help gets rid of the stigma.</v>

364
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.803
<v Speaker 1>It gets rid of the hassle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes therapy accessible and </v>

365
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:54.380
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

366
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.243
<v Speaker 1>if you're like me and you think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could benefit from speaking to someone </v>

367
00:19:57.231 --> 00:19:58.064
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider checking out better </v>
