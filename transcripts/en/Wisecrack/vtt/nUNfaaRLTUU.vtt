<v Speaker 1>the only defense attorney who breaks the</v>

8
00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>law more often than Michael Cohen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daredevil,</v>

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.833
<v Speaker 1>Matthew Murdoch's Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always been a defining element of </v>

10
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:35.164
<v Speaker 1>his character and his distinguished him </v>
<v Speaker 1>from most other nonreligious </v>

11
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>superheroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in this most recent season that</v>

12
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:41.224
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism comes front and center to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand matthew struggle and why we </v>

13
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.724
<v Speaker 1>think season three is so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to dive into one of the most </v>

14
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>important questions that theologians </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been struggling with for Millennia.</v>

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.593
<v Speaker 1>So join us as we break down how the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>without fear that comes the man without </v>

16
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>faith in this wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quick take on daredevil season three and</v>

17
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>of course spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.153
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some months after the events of </v>

19
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:05.524
<v Speaker 1>defenders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but presumably before the children of </v>

20
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>faint I was double parked their donut </v>
<v Speaker 1>chip in Greenwich Village,</v>

21
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Matt Murdock Awakens from a coma and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>church run orphanage he was raised in.</v>

22
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>While the worst of his injuries have </v>
<v Speaker 1>healed,</v>

23
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.863
<v Speaker 1>his spirit remains broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daredevil is convinced that his crusade </v>

24
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>against injustice had ultimately failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

25
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.853
<v Speaker 1>he takes up residence in the chapel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undercroft retreating from society and </v>

26
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>allowing his public persona to remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead to the world.</v>

27
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.413
<v Speaker 1>This makeshift bat cave services one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary set pieces for the season </v>

28
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>and that constant conversations between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch,</v>

29
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>fatherland and sister Maggie drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of the engagement with maths,</v>

30
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:41.914
<v Speaker 1>Catholic faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or rather the lack thereof like lex </v>

31
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:45.514
<v Speaker 1>luther and Batman versus Superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daredevil is blinded by the problem of </v>

32
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.983
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which lex summarizes as God is all </v>

33
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be all good,</v>

34
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's all good and he can not be all </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

35
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>In one scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch in Paris has seemingly senseless</v>

36
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>suffering to that of Joe Story,</v>

37
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 2>of God's perfect servant job prayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday,</v>

38
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 2>dawn with his knees on the ground and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing the third slot of 10 goats,</v>

39
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 2>one for each of his children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn them at the alter in God's honor,</v>

40
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>follow God soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

41
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 2>he was the most loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the story I met you and know what</v>

42
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:24.230
<v Speaker 2>happens next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten murdered.</v>

43
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 2>All 10 of his children in cold blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>scorched every inch of job's land lashed</v>

44
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 2>at his body to his skin was covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody welts.</v>

45
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.473
<v Speaker 2>God range misery on the life of his most</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect servant and still job and not </v>

46
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:42.581
<v Speaker 2>cursing what I realized Joe was a pussy.</v>

47
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.403
<v Speaker 1>Matt wonders why God would not similarly</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak to him whether God had really </v>

48
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:49.904
<v Speaker 1>called him to the vocation of vigilante </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether God had brought about good </v>

49
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>through the devil of Hell's kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the steadfastly faithful job,</v>

50
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>murdoch comes to the that God is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>You might hate God right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the feeling is not mutual.</v>

52
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate him.</v>

53
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I've just seen as true face as all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the way things are going,</v>

54
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it seems like he's not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the season.</v>

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.823
<v Speaker 1>More and more evidence mounts for God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>indifference society seems irredeemably </v>

56
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>corrupt entirely under the control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson Fisk,</v>

57
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>fisk bribes and black males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>feds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>

59
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>judges and jurist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning good citizens into criminals,</v>

60
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.093
<v Speaker 1>law enforcers into lawbreakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the very institutions devoted to </v>

61
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>justice into instruments of injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given daredevils,</v>

62
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's after recall the words of Jesus.</v>

63
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Do not fear those who can kill the body </v>
<v Speaker 1>but cannot kill the soul.</v>

64
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Rather fear Him who can destroy both </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and soul.</v>

65
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.680
<v Speaker 1>You know fisk in a nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

66
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.683
<v Speaker 1>and we can't not mention the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this overweight and ostentatious New </v>

67
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.153
<v Speaker 1>York real estate developer who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically above the law suddenly takes </v>

68
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>up residence and a presidential hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so subtle.</v>

69
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Marvel daredevils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new founders,</v>

70
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>so theism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is his anger and frustration at God</v>

71
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>amplifies his disgust with humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank Godfrey.</v>

72
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.260
<v Speaker 3>He didn't help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

73
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.000
<v Speaker 1>He abuses his friends and is generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>less interested in saving society.</v>

74
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Then punching it in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch's broken relationships with both</v>

75
00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:21.884
<v Speaker 1>God and the people around him can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cast in Catholic terms as a failure to </v>

76
00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.190
<v Speaker 1>do what Jesus called the two greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>commandments,</v>

77
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.400
<v Speaker 1>to love God and to love your neighbor as</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

78
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but this itself isn't unique to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific religion.</v>

79
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.383
<v Speaker 1>These two relationships represent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two basic axes which believers of most </v>

80
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:41.030
<v Speaker 1>religions have to concern themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

81
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.950
<v Speaker 1>When deciding how to navigate life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>specially when sacred and secular duties</v>

82
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.873
<v Speaker 1>seem to make different demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's here that Matthew directly </v>

83
00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 1>confronts an issue Christianity has </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with for centuries.</v>

84
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.203
<v Speaker 1>How does one reconcile and obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and an obligation to others is </v>

85
00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.530
<v Speaker 1>specially if there's others exist in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tainted,</v>

86
00:05:00.531 --> 00:05:05.531
<v Speaker 1>a moral world or in Christian parlance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in the world but not of the world.</v>

87
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Theologian h dot Richard Niebuhr in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

88
00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:09.704
<v Speaker 1>Christ and culture identify several </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic answers that Christians have </v>

89
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.140
<v Speaker 1>offered over the centuries for how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

90
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>and while he is specifically concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Christianity,</v>

91
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 1>his paradigm would mostly work within </v>
<v Speaker 1>any religious tradition.</v>

92
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.573
<v Speaker 1>Briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be called one separation to </v>

93
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.160
<v Speaker 1>accommodation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free synthesis for paradox and five,</v>

94
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.083
<v Speaker 1>transformation daredevils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arkin season three season transition </v>

95
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:39.410
<v Speaker 1>between two of these models for figuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>out our relationship to God and man,</v>

96
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 1>separation and synthesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former,</v>

97
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.590
<v Speaker 1>which Niebuhr also calls Christ against </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

98
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.603
<v Speaker 1>prescribes a radical renunciation of end</v>
<v Speaker 1>near total separation from the </v>

99
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:50.834
<v Speaker 1>surrounding society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the path ascribed to you by </v>

100
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>monks and Mennonites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also exactly what daredevil does in</v>

101
00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the early when like the rest of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials,</v>

102
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.613
<v Speaker 1>he moves back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Home is a grown ass adult to mooch off </v>

103
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>his parents living in their basement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having his mom cleaned his laundry.</v>

104
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

105
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.953
<v Speaker 1>and like a medieval monk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's literally cloistered himself in a </v>

106
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.284
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He treats his identity of Matthew </v>

107
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch as dead to the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirits,</v>

108
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>his friendships with foggy and Karen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they find out he is alive,</v>

109
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>he pushes them away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies to them,</v>

110
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.113
<v Speaker 1>steals from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and treats them as mere instruments of </v>

111
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.144
<v Speaker 1>his agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As daredevil has mat in the friend </v>

112
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>lately without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but deep down,</v>

113
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hurting him as much as it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting us,</v>

114
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>is only engagement with the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's punching it with his fist,</v>

115
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>which is one way to construe being </v>
<v Speaker 1>against culture neighbor while affirming</v>

116
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.603
<v Speaker 1>that each of his five models was </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially correct and it times the </v>

117
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>appropriate answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevertheless,</v>

118
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.544
<v Speaker 1>was particularly critical of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>separation model as overly simplistic </v>

119
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.313
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately futile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can completely closed themselves </v>

120
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:57.824
<v Speaker 1>off to the outside world as daredevil </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered the hard way when Bullseye </v>

121
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>St Patrick's.</v>

122
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.883
<v Speaker 1>It's the turning point of the season and</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly poignant and it's Catholic </v>

123
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:07.934
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of which make clear to murdoch that </v>

124
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:10.424
<v Speaker 1>this separation model doesn't succeed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>either serving his neighbors or the man </v>

125
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.074
<v Speaker 1>upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First bullseyes eyes attack is a </v>

126
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 1>violation of the long established norm </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sanctuary.</v>

127
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Karen page had sought safety there from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the retribution of Wilson Fisk and by </v>

128
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:25.574
<v Speaker 1>conspiring to murder her there kingpin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bullseye committed particularly </v>

129
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:30.284
<v Speaker 1>agregious sin in the eyes of Catholics </v>
<v Speaker 1>who see violence on consecrated grounds </v>

130
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>as profaning something sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the murder itself,</v>

131
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 1>fatherland some sacrifices his own life </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon the altar,</v>

132
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.653
<v Speaker 1>saving Karen's his death is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmistakable illusion to Christ claim I </v>

133
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 1>am the good shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lay down my life for the sheep pastor,</v>

134
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>deriving from the Latin for Shepard </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullseyes diabolical attack,</v>

135
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>his violation of sanctuary and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>martyrdom of father Lantam are all proof</v>

136
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>positive to murdoch.</v>

137
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>That is flirtation with the for </v>
<v Speaker 1>separation model is a failure.</v>

138
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.033
<v Speaker 1>It's at this point that he [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>the uniquely Catholic way of </v>

139
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>understanding how to deal with both God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world which kneeboard calls this</v>

140
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:12.704
<v Speaker 1>synthesis model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The synthesis model affirms that both </v>

141
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:15.814
<v Speaker 1>the Sacred Institution of the church and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secular institutions of society are </v>

142
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>both means through which God brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>about good.</v>

143
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>That includes the government as a means </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bringing about justice,</v>

144
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>daredevils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace of the separation model,</v>

145
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.814
<v Speaker 1>and the first half of the season </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincided with his disillusionment with </v>

146
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:32.324
<v Speaker 1>the legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He become convinced that the courts </v>

147
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.114
<v Speaker 1>couldn't successfully serve as God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>means for enacting justice against </v>

148
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:38.834
<v Speaker 1>criminals such as fisk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he later reconnects with his </v>

149
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:42.824
<v Speaker 1>friends and with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the legal system to put kingpin </v>

150
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.543
<v Speaker 1>back behind bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see how it's a step towards </v>

151
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 1>affirming this synthesis model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

152
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch's returned to the fold.</v>

153
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.533
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and daredevil tempted up until the </v>

154
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>climactic fight to kill the kingpin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whereas in the first season,</v>

155
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>his temptation to finish off fisk was </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply a struggle with the deadly sin of</v>

156
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.034
<v Speaker 1>Wrath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it indicates Murdoch is still </v>

157
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:07.914
<v Speaker 1>questioning whether God is using social </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions to bring about good or </v>

158
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>whether daredevil has to take matters </v>
<v Speaker 1>into his own hands.</v>

159
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.040
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch has rejected the separation,</v>

160
00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:18.874
<v Speaker 1>just approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not until the redemption of </v>

161
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:21.564
<v Speaker 1>reign of diem that he wants again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully affirms the Catholic approach of </v>

162
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the show start,</v>

163
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch's core conviction has been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was past the point of redemption.</v>

164
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Batman has his personal code against </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing that's informed by the murder of</v>

165
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>his parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite sharing a similar origin,</v>

166
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.563
<v Speaker 1>the show is clear that read Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scruples came from his Catholic faith </v>

167
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.913
<v Speaker 1>for Murdoch.</v>

168
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.843
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a moral to execute his enemies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he held hope that even someone </v>

169
00:09:48.071 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>so sinful as Wilson fisk might have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>change of heart and repent,</v>

170
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's not until this season that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character that had broke bad is shown to</v>

171
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>go good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again.</v>

172
00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.523
<v Speaker 1>FBI special agent reign of Diem is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the many government officials </v>

173
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>blackmailed by FIS in addition to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>

174
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Nadeem is the accomplished a eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullseyes murder of father Atlanta,</v>

175
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.263
<v Speaker 1>and yet he's not beyond redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nadeem agrees to testify against fisk </v>

176
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 1>knowing full well the danger of crossing</v>
<v Speaker 1>his crime boss,</v>

177
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and when fisk gets to the grand jury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the turncoats testimony.</v>

178
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:21.594
<v Speaker 1>Feudal Nadeem instead of running </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily lays down his life so that </v>

179
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>his dying deposition would send the king</v>
<v Speaker 1>pin back to prison.</v>

180
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is what finally restores Matt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdock's.</v>

181
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.293
<v Speaker 1>Faith seeing God appear to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>redemption in human hearts and justice </v>

182
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 1>through social institutions.</v>

183
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.323
<v Speaker 1>Not separately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in synthesis with one another to </v>

184
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:42.834
<v Speaker 1>bring about good in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the ultimate example of </v>

185
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 1>kneeboards synthesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vertical relationship to God and the</v>

186
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>horizontal relationship with man working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

187
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the Vertical Relationship Aka Nadine's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

188
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Getting to tuned is the thing which </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows the horizontal relationship,</v>

189
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Aka Society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including institutions such as the legal</v>

190
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 1>system to be the means by which God </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings about justice.</v>

191
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>The two are working together in </v>
<v Speaker 1>synthesis and without the vertical.</v>

192
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>The horizontal would have failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The season ends with Murdoch having come</v>

193
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:15.384
<v Speaker 1>through his crisis of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no longer sequestered away from </v>

194
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:18.714
<v Speaker 1>society and the church basement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but preaching from the pulpit to his </v>

195
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:22.194
<v Speaker 1>whole community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no longer a strange from his </v>

196
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:24.834
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting the gang back together in </v>

197
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:27.234
<v Speaker 1>the form of Nelson Murdoch and paige </v>
<v Speaker 1>attorneys at law and he's no longer </v>

198
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:31.464
<v Speaker 1>blind to is God's goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trying to see as much of it as </v>
