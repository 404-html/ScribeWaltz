1
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are unusual in the sense that </v>

2
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>statistically it's unusual could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a statistical at Ollie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical fluke.</v>

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.503
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes are occurring any more </v>

5
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>frequently now than they had then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred last year or 10 years ago,</v>

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>or 10 years into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to believe that,</v>

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>and it has nothing to do with global </v>
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>

8
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a question that we often get.</v>

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we've learned </v>

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>seismologists is that earthquakes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred anytime at any place,</v>

11
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.404
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even have to occur at plate </v>

12
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.230
<v Speaker 1>boundaries for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole other topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>but along some of the major plate </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>

15
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:45.944
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>that Pacific northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>we have evidence of pastor earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually isn't,</v>

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.393
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we didn't have instruments </v>

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>going back more than about a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or so.</v>

20
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have an instrumental record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a record from a newspaper,</v>

21
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 1>old newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>We have a record from some old mission </v>
<v Speaker 1>records,</v>

23
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:07.994
<v Speaker 1>particularly in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish mission records and elsewhere </v>

24
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>throughout the western hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>we have very long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>historical records in China and Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

27
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>and in parts of Asia where people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been writing things down for quite a few</v>

28
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.241
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:24.074
<v Speaker 1>but in some places we simply don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that written record and we have to rely </v>

30
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>again on proxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of things we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place like a California or Seattle,</v>

32
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:35.180
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California first.</v>

33
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing we can do when we have a fault</v>

34
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>like the San Andreas is to actually dig </v>
<v Speaker 1>a trench across that fault.</v>

35
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And when we trench across false like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

36
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>and you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trenching it at different places,</v>

37
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see in the disturbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>soil the record of pastor earthquakes,</v>

38
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it may occur every hundred and 50 or 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>or three or 400 years,</v>

39
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.123
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with very good carbon dating or </v>

40
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>other geological techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>we can get a good sense of what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>history is.</v>

42
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that trenching at various </v>
<v Speaker 1>places along the fault,</v>

43
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>we can even get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an estimate of the,</v>

44
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.154
<v Speaker 1>of the size of the rupture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives us a way to calculate the </v>

45
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:14.954
<v Speaker 1>magnitude that then allows us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate the repeat intervals safe for </v>

46
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:19.364
<v Speaker 1>these very large earthquakes in Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I should say more generally off the </v>

47
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.033
<v Speaker 1>coast of British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington and Oregon going down into </v>

48
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.844
<v Speaker 1>northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of a plate </v>

49
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we call a subduction zone.</v>

50
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.464
<v Speaker 1>It's a convergent boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates the cascades and the </v>

51
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>so we can't trench it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.823
<v Speaker 1>but what we can do is look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of uplift on the coast because </v>

54
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>every time an earthquake occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.983
<v Speaker 1>the upper plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the coast of </v>

56
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Washington and Oregon and northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>California gets bumped up a little bit.</v>

57
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>And by looking at the sediment Terry </v>
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>

58
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>actually sometimes it can go down as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking the sediment Terry record,</v>

60
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the way,</v>

61
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>say even trees or drowned by encroaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>water or lifted above the water table or</v>

62
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.654
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

63
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a sense of the history,</v>

64
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.933
<v Speaker 1>people who look at things like tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings or the history of corals </v>

66
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] corals up there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we go elsewhere around the world,</v>

67
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>we see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>these are all proxies for past big </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes.</v>

69
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>There's another proxy which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>in particular for the Pacific Northwest </v>
<v Speaker 1>Works and that is,</v>

71
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.123
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes along that boundary have a </v>

72
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>tendency to generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an army and when it's an Ami,</v>

73
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>propagates mu or moves across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean,</v>

74
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>particularly a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it hits islands,</v>

75
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the Pacific,</v>

76
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what's called tsunami deposits.</v>

77
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very turbulent phenomena,</v>

78
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>brings up pebbles and rocks and disturbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beaches and,</v>

79
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can detect some of those.</v>

80
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in particularly for the,</v>

81
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>for the particular case of the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>

82
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 1700,</v>

83
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>actually in 1700 a tsunami was </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated.</v>

84
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>It was recorded in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by looking at the,</v>

85
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunami records in Japan,</v>

86
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.573
<v Speaker 1>both the historical record and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual geologic record of that tsunami </v>

87
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.733
<v Speaker 1>modelers have been able to kind of back </v>
<v Speaker 1>project that go backwards across the </v>

88
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.134
<v Speaker 1>Pacific show that the source of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunami was in fact the Pacific </v>

89
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get a good date 1700,</v>

90
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that event.</v>

91
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>That event looks like to be about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude nine,</v>

92
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.023
<v Speaker 1>nine and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bigger than what we had in Chile </v>

93
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>just a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

95
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.013
<v Speaker 1>and it's about as big as the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake we've recorded </v>

96
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:49.743
<v Speaker 1>instrumentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that we know that that boundary </v>

97
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>can support a monstrous earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude nine,</v>

98
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>we can go about the job of measuring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wa,</v>

99
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>how fast the plates are converging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making some assumptions about how stress</v>

100
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.984
<v Speaker 1>is building up and come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what the repeat interval might </v>

101
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>be for that earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

102
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad to say we're pretty close to the </v>

103
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>repeat interval for that earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a forecast.</v>

104
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not a prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a forecast.</v>

105
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And thankfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the United States,</v>

106
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.130
<v Speaker 1>going back a decade or more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>seattle and Oregon had been well aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the potential for that earthquake,</v>

108
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and they're taking the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>

109
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>One would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to mitigate the potential damage.</v>
