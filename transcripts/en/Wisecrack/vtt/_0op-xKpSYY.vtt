1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.473
<v Speaker 1>In order to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often think they have to </v>

2
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.174
<v Speaker 1>constantly be achieving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly going from one thing to the </v>

3
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossing things off of their to do list.</v>

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.363
<v Speaker 1>But as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not in the present moment and </v>

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>their productivity would be so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater if they stayed present as well </v>

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:22.914
<v Speaker 1>as their performance on their tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's Morris that their relationships </v>

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:26.964
<v Speaker 1>would improve drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what research on charisma shows is </v>

8
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:30.504
<v Speaker 1>that highly charismatic people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are able to be so fully </v>

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>present with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what leads to that incredible</v>

10
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that influence that they have.</v>

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>A research shows that our mind actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanders about 50% of the time.</v>

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>And research also shows that when our </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is wandering,</v>

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>we are never as happy as when our mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the present moment.</v>

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>So if your mind is in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about something that's going to</v>

15
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.404
<v Speaker 1>happen or in the past because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>regretting something or angry at </v>

16
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to feel more negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in the present moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're doing a task,</v>

19
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't particularly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually feel happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also a,</v>

21
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.613
<v Speaker 1>what we know is that you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be more productive when you're in that </v>

22
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>state because you're going to naturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>be focused.</v>

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.583
<v Speaker 1>One way that you can start to bring your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind back into the present given its </v>

24
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.004
<v Speaker 1>tendency to wander is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through breathing exercises and </v>

25
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>relaxation exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pure relax your body,</v>

26
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.713
<v Speaker 1>your mind will naturally start to settle</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and breathing is a very effective </v>

27
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.194
<v Speaker 1>way to do that and very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So meditation practices can really help </v>

28
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you observe your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become aware of its tendencies,</v>

29
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its tendency to wander and um,</v>

30
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.783
<v Speaker 1>help you through that awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shift your attention back into the </v>

31
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.354
<v Speaker 1>present moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meditation is an exercise in which you </v>

32
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>are engaging fully with the present </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

33
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.253
<v Speaker 1>So if it's a fantastic way to train your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind to be more present with what is </v>

34
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we currently are in a time and age where</v>

35
00:01:58.441 --> 00:01:59.274
<v Speaker 1>multitasking has just become the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly being pinged by our </v>

36
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly receiving emails.</v>

37
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:05.994
<v Speaker 1>And all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if we were being interrupted </v>

38
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.103
<v Speaker 1>from our stream stream of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more is that we interrupt </v>

39
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.464
<v Speaker 1>ourselves so we will interrupt what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing to check our phones for </v>

40
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So multitasking,</v>

41
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very draining on our system.</v>

42
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Our attention is constantly in demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if you were,</v>

43
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you're working on 12 different things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>You can't give your all to one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things with meditation practices.</v>

45
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You can really train your mind to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more present and um,</v>

46
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>help you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>stay on task with what is going on.</v>

48
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.273
<v Speaker 1>Our research shows that people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate can increase their attention </v>

49
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

50
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.123
<v Speaker 1>in some research studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use a task called the attentional </v>

51
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:51.414
<v Speaker 1>blink task in which you show people a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of different images in very fast </v>

52
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>sequence and usually we would only pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>up every fourth image.</v>

53
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
<v Speaker 1>We don't actually see the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we call it the attentional </v>

54
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>blink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>research has shown that after meditation</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat,</v>

56
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>people tend to not show that attentional</v>
<v Speaker 1>blink or to show it less.</v>

57
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>It just very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that if we call him our mind,</v>

58
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>were somehow able to pick up things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better in our environment,</v>

59
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.573
<v Speaker 1>which also makes sense in terms of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided our mind is with regards to </v>

60
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>multitasking and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When our mind is very settled,</v>

61
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>then we're able to literally see more </v>
<v Speaker 1>things register more.</v>
