<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is team America </v>

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>world police from South Park creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Stone and Matt Parker,</v>

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>who were famously exiled from Earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>after literally pissing off everyone,</v>

8
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.943
<v Speaker 1>the film opens in France where some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kindly terrorists chaperone a beeping </v>

9
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>briefcase that is until the US Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>team choppers in.</v>

10
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.863
<v Speaker 1>They win the interpretive dance round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but take home the silver in not dying </v>

11
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.503
<v Speaker 1>over on broad street and actor named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Sings about one of Earth's best </v>

12
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:54.584
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has a attracting the attention </v>

13
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>of agent Colson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Morpheus,</v>

14
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean a balding horny puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes him to Rushmore Academy where </v>

15
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>he asks him to do the plot of 21 jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.573
<v Speaker 1>but with terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although considering how teens were in </v>

17
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:10.394
<v Speaker 1>those days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't much of a difference in </v>

18
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Korea town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a near site,</v>

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>a dictator has the terrorists over for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kimchi.</v>

20
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.993
<v Speaker 1>Giving them some bombs as party favors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gary gets his eyebrows done at the spa </v>

21
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:21.284
<v Speaker 1>so he can infiltrate the Cantina Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but soon team America shows up and </v>

22
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>sweeps the gold medal and destroying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>native culture.</v>

23
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>America's oldest past time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the team gets drunk.</v>

24
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>All friendship and Lisa and Gary do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bippity Boppity Boo.</v>

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.013
<v Speaker 1>Gary's not the only one getting blown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack donaghy fears the Olympics or </v>

26
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:42.974
<v Speaker 1>stealing Liz lemon's ratings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners with k town for a piece </v>

27
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>ceremony where Kim will secretly </v>
<v Speaker 1>detonated bombs.</v>

28
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no air quotes on that one.</v>

29
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Remembering that it's the end of act </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

30
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Gary quits and gets mild.</v>

31
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Fat Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide squad's HQ just as Kim blows the</v>

33
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.524
<v Speaker 1>team's cover and captures them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their covers not the only thing </v>

34
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>getting blown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a call back just for you.</v>

35
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Gary trains with Spotswood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainspotting,</v>

36
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.463
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go to k town to get the band </v>

37
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:17.924
<v Speaker 1>back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill most of the film actors guild </v>

38
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and no intelligent life is lost with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

39
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Empty Gary attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whores it up and engages in the time.</v>

40
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Honored tradition of oratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that can be an asshole is</v>

41
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:32.144
<v Speaker 1>it Dick donaghy gets ousted from NBC and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim falls on an outright baseball cap </v>

42
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.993
<v Speaker 1>revealing his true form a horse team </v>
<v Speaker 1>America world police can be viewed as a </v>

43
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>response to the surge of nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The USA experienced after nine slash 11,</v>

44
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>considered by many to be just never </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgettable.</v>

45
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.123
<v Speaker 1>The film is a satire stylized after </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive Hollywood blockbusters and </v>

46
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Netflix's which commonly celebrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>American power and perseverance.</v>

47
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>The film beats down cliche after cliche </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they owe it money.</v>

48
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.533
<v Speaker 1>It mocks the emotional levers these </v>
<v Speaker 1>films try to pull just as it makes fun </v>

49
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>of the overly sentimental country </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballots that make war seemed great.</v>

50
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.573
<v Speaker 1>The big bangs and puppet bans lies a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more subtle exploration of America's </v>

51
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.074
<v Speaker 1>role in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some scholars support the hegemonic </v>

52
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.164
<v Speaker 1>stability theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which supposes that the world will be </v>

53
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>better off with a superpower calling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

54
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Team America believes in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionalism.</v>

55
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.683
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the United States was </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than all other seven countries </v>

56
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>and therefore duty bound to shape the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world too.</v>

57
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It's obese standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you understand?</v>

58
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.163
<v Speaker 1>Every country in the world is in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it my responsibility to do </v>

59
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.214
<v Speaker 1>something because like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the one with the power to do </v>

60
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.354
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film pokes fun at this attitude by </v>

61
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>showing various ways that Americans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly suited to boss baby.</v>

62
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:07.864
<v Speaker 1>Every one around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the film identifies a foreign </v>

63
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it notes the distance from the USA,</v>

64
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.083
<v Speaker 1>exemplifying the tendency Americans had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look down on other countries as well </v>

65
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:17.344
<v Speaker 1>as the metric system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cities such as Paris and tattooing are </v>

66
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>reduced to their most famous landmarks </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are portrayed incorrectly as being</v>

67
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>right next to each other instead of on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of each other.</v>

68
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Foreign languages are portrayed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jibberish,</v>

69
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>although it's all human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

70
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.353
<v Speaker 1>this ignorance and lack of respect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries manifests as team </v>

71
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>America demolishes world landmarks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make room for a whole food.</v>

72
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>

73
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.033
<v Speaker 1>the self centered attitude is similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrorist psychology according to </v>

74
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>smoking hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lisa,</v>

75
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>usually a case of malignant narcissism </v>
<v Speaker 1>you brought on during childhood.</v>

76
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tearing me apart,</v>

77
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.504
<v Speaker 1>Lisa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film asks whether this careless </v>

78
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:01.070
<v Speaker 1>destructiveness and the name of American</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals is any better than the terrorists</v>

79
00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>intentional attacks because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that counts,</v>

80
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>but the film is far from a one sided hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece on American jingoism unchained.</v>

81
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 1>It criticizes ignorance on the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the aisle to the actors standing</v>

82
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.284
<v Speaker 1>in for Alcoholic Grad students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or liberals think they're better than </v>

83
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>team America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film actors guild believes that what</v>

84
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>the world needs is compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not violence.</v>

85
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>All the team America does is create new </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies,</v>

86
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but their position is based on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>blinding Elitism as team Americas.</v>

87
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>What the world needs is an international</v>
<v Speaker 1>advisory committee who truly understands</v>

88
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>global politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely us and their ignorance,</v>

89
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>causes them to bumble their way into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong side of a global crisis.</v>

90
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.023
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film concludes that despite the </v>

91
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.574
<v Speaker 1>occasional terrorist attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's got to deal with purely </v>

92
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>destructive entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if those entities can sing.</v>

93
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.603
<v Speaker 1>So really in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film endorses a more cautious </v>

94
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in America,</v>

95
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

96
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it was the state motto of Florida after </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

97
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.003
<v Speaker 1>before it flooded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sharks ate everybody until they </v>

98
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.314
<v Speaker 1>were dead.</v>

99
