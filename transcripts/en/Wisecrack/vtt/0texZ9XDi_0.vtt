00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Benign Causes Depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about a bit less connections.</v>

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.343
<v Speaker 1>There were few that were really </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging for me because I realized </v>

3
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>how much I recognize them in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the hardest,</v>

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else first,</v>

5
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>but when I was in 2009 on Christmas Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it even sadder.</v>

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>The story happened on Christmas Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I used to live on junk food.</v>

7
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I used to eat appallingly and on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas Eve,</v>

8
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:30.924
<v Speaker 1>2009,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into my local KFC at lunchtime </v>

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>and I turned up and I gave my order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so disgusting.</v>

10
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't even repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy behind the counter said,</v>

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>are Johann so glad you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>so you walked off and he came back with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other staff and they bought me a</v>

14
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:51.771
<v Speaker 1>massive Christmas card and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>written it to our best customer and so I</v>

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>was looking at this and my heart sank.</v>

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't even the fried chicken shop.</v>

17
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I come to the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very unfortunate that low point,</v>

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>but we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.913
<v Speaker 1>Junk food has taken over our diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not admittedly to the extreme the </v>

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but junk food is increasingly dominating</v>

21
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>our diets and it's making us physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>One thing that really shocked me in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research is that there's.</v>

23
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.793
<v Speaker 1>There's really good evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something similar has happened </v>

24
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:18.354
<v Speaker 1>with our minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of junk values have taken </v>

25
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>over our minds and they've made us </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally sick,</v>

26
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>but the thousands of years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers have said,</v>

27
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 1>if you think life is about money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>status and and showing off,</v>

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.743
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel terrible right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Confucius on down people that </v>

29
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.773
<v Speaker 1>rewarding is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but weirdly nobody had actually </v>

30
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>scientifically investigated it until an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible man.</v>

31
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I got to know your professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kasser,</v>

32
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>who's at Knox University in Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so professor cass a new.</v>

33
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to human motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this basically,</v>

34
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>to put it crudely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two kinds of human motivation,</v>

35
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you play the piano.</v>

36
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.133
<v Speaker 1>If you play the piano in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you love it and it gives you </v>

37
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an intrinsic motivation.</v>

38
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing it to get something out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit.</v>

39
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You're just doing it because that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you joy right now.</v>

40
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you play the piano not because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you joy,</v>

41
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.034
<v Speaker 1>but in a dive bar to pay the rent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your parents are really </v>

42
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.624
<v Speaker 1>pressuring you to be a piano maestro or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd know to impress a man might be some </v>

43
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>weird piano fetishist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>That would be an extrinsic reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play the piano.</v>

45
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing it for the experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

46
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it to get something out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it at one remove.</v>

47
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it to get something out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience.</v>

48
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Now we're all a mixture of intrinsic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrinsic values obviously,</v>

49
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:35.184
<v Speaker 1>and we change throughout our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but professor cass discovered some </v>

50
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is the more your life is</v>

51
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>dominated by extrinsic values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're doing things,</v>

52
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:45.504
<v Speaker 1>not because you think they're important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of how you'll look to other </v>

53
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're seem on the outside,</v>

54
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and anxious.</v>

55
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:54.294
<v Speaker 1>It's a quite significant effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Been found in 22 studies with </v>

56
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>depression and 14 studies with anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

57
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>there are many reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you just one.</v>

58
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we know is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's a real source of joy in</v>

59
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.390
<v Speaker 1>human life since really necessary have </v>
<v Speaker 1>what are called flow states right there.</v>

60
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Moments when you're doing something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really love.</v>

61
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's writing for someone else.</v>

62
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It might be running.</v>

63
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not that for me or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

64
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.060
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

65
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.063
<v Speaker 1>when you time seems to collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're totally in the moment of what </v>

66
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're flowing right?</v>

67
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.623
<v Speaker 1>Extreme extrinsic values massively </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt your ability to get into flow </v>

68
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're playing the piano.</v>

69
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the guys playing the piano for </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic reasons,</v>

70
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it gives them joy.</v>

71
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.883
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine suddenly has to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I the best piano player in New York </v>

72
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>City today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's better than me?</v>

73
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>How are these people listening to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they judging me?</v>

74
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to get paid for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see how it would jolt you out of</v>

75
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>the flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>When you think extrinsically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get jolted out of flow state,</v>

77
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.853
<v Speaker 1>there are many reasons why extrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>values make us feel bad and they ruin </v>

78
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>the quality of your relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They crowd out intrinsic values.</v>

79
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.023
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but press castles also showing that </v>

80
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>extrinsic values have been taking over </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture.</v>

81
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>We are becoming more and more dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by these extrinsic values.</v>

82
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.383
<v Speaker 1>This we are immersed in this way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking for the moment we're born more </v>

83
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>18 month old children recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's m,</v>

84
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.193
<v Speaker 1>the know that own surname.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are pickled in advertising messages </v>

85
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>telling us that life is about living </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrinsically,</v>

86
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine an advert that told you,</v>

87
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're great.</v>

88
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>You look fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smell nice,</v>

89
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>you're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need anything more today.</v>

90
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>That would be the worst advert that ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>been done.</v>

91
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.644
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advertising is the ultimate frenemy is </v>

92
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>always telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh babe,</v>

93
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

94
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:36.994
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't stink right now what professor </v>

95
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Castillo's showed as he puts it is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some level we all know this,</v>

96
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.523
<v Speaker 1>Everyone watching this knows you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lie on the on the last day of </v>

98
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:47.704
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will not lie there and think about </v>

99
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>all the things you bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>You will not think about all the hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put in at the office.</v>

101
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>You will think about moments of deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and connection,</v>

102
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.963
<v Speaker 1>but as professor Cassar puts it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a machine that is constantly </v>

103
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>diverting us from what is meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about life.</v>

104
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a wonderful experiment is done </v>
<v Speaker 1>before Professor Castle's work,</v>

105
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think it really illustrates this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was done.</v>

106
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 78.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple experiment.</v>

107
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>You get a lot of five year olds and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in a sandpit and you split them</v>

108
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:16.894
<v Speaker 1>into two groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first group is shown to </v>

109
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>advertisements for specific toy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the 19,</v>

110
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>78 equivalent of peppa pig was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

111
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.963
<v Speaker 1>and the second group is shown show no </v>
<v Speaker 1>adverts and at the end of it they give </v>

112
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>all the kids a choice.</v>

113
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.630
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

114
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.463
<v Speaker 1>kids go choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can either play with a nice boy </v>

115
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.413
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't have the toy from the out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or you can play with a nasty boy </v>

116
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:38.194
<v Speaker 1>who's got the toy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids who didn't see the ad mostly </v>

117
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>choose the nice boy without the toy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids who saw the ad,</v>

118
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>mostly twos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nasty boy who's got the toy,</v>

119
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>so just to advertisements to prime those</v>
<v Speaker 1>children to choose and inanimate lump of</v>

120
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:51.514
<v Speaker 1>plastic over kindness and connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are all being driven by way more </v>

121
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>advertising than that everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Anyone watching this and I would include</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in that,</v>

123
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.794
<v Speaker 1>he stayed late at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something they don't want to do to </v>

124
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>buy something they don't need rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than go be home with their kids.</v>

125
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:06.794
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've fallen prey to that dynamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and professor Kessler has really shown </v>

126
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>this way that we've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to unpick these junk values,</v>

127
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>these junk values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've been fed for so long.</v>

128
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>There are kind of KFC for the soul and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making us feel terrible.</v>
