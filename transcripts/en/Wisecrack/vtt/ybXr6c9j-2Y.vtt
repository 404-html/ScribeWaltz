<v Speaker 1>Jared,</v>

5
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southpark creators,</v>

6
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Matt Stone and Trey Parker sure do make </v>
<v Speaker 1>us laugh,</v>

7
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but they make something else to a metric</v>
<v Speaker 1>crap ton of money.</v>

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a tale as old as time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest stop,</v>

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animated Christmas card,</v>

<v Speaker 1>nab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy central series,</v>

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Oscar nomination,</v>

12
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.831
<v Speaker 1>Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yada,</v>

13
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and joy.</v>

14
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>A collective net worth of $800,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

15
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite being an ad supported business </v>

16
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.850
<v Speaker 1>like some other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know south park has never been afraid</v>

17
00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:37.684
<v Speaker 1>to bite the hand that feeds it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at how stone and </v>

18
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.104
<v Speaker 1>Parker lampooned the financial world </v>
<v Speaker 1>across four of our favorite south park </v>

19
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:44.974
<v Speaker 1>adventures cash rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything around us in this widespread </v>

20
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>condition on economics in south park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gnomes,</v>

21
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>the sleepy town of South Park readies </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

22
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:54.804
<v Speaker 1>very classic David and Goliath battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real showdown between massive </v>

23
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>corporate coffee chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard books and the homegrown mom and pop</v>

24
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>coffee shop tweak brother.</v>

25
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.903
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I own a coffee shop and now a great big </v>

26
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>multimillion dollar company is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move in and try to take all my business,</v>

27
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 2>which means I may have to shut down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell my son,</v>

28
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 2>tweak into slavery.</v>

29
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>South Park challenges are natural bias </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the little guy by demonstrating,</v>

30
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.153
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the little guy is actually a </v>

31
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:19.674
<v Speaker 1>total asshole and in south park this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular asshole isn't above keeping </v>

32
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>his own son hopped up on caffeine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploiting children for the media.</v>

33
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>If it helps us business stay afloat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to stop large corporations.</v>

34
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.513
<v Speaker 1>Prop 10 is about children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vote yes on prop 10 or else you hate </v>

35
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.253
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very notion that a small business </v>

36
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.894
<v Speaker 1>might be driven by impure capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>motives is a message we're not used to </v>

37
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>hearing and the townspeople of Southpark</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't ready for it either,</v>

38
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.853
<v Speaker 1>which is why the tweak and horror books </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivalry is neatly stereotyped as just </v>

39
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.024
<v Speaker 1>another innocent family business versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big fat magic carpet guy from New </v>

40
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

41
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.114
<v Speaker 1>throughout the episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most arguments in favor of big business </v>

42
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>are immaturely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouted down,</v>

43
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>not with reason or facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well with immature shouting.</v>

44
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardon me,</v>

45
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Mr assface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

46
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>let's hear your side of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's the real bully here?</v>

47
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.693
<v Speaker 1>GNOMES demonstrates how bald face </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeals to emotion can be used to </v>

48
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>disguise the cold hard mechanisms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

49
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.923
<v Speaker 2>I've got one for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about doing a report on how large </v>

50
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 2>corporations take over little family </v>
<v Speaker 2>owned businesses,</v>

51
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.433
<v Speaker 1>although he may be a staple of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community who charms people with this </v>

52
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:27.974
<v Speaker 1>folksy marketing Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweak proves himself to be an even more </v>

53
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:31.514
<v Speaker 1>cutthroat capitalist than his rival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids are great to get people on our </v>

54
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:34.964
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just throw a child in a </v>

55
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:37.454
<v Speaker 1>political commercial to sale your </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and it isn't long before the </v>

56
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.144
<v Speaker 1>preteen protagonists of southpark become</v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient ponds in his agenda as </v>

57
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>they're forced to passes anti-corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>words off as their own,</v>

58
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.553
<v Speaker 2>and as the voluminous corporate </v>
<v Speaker 2>automaton bulldoze its way through </v>

59
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.743
<v Speaker 2>Belgium America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps there is no stopping the </v>

60
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 2>corporate machine</v>

61
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.423
<v Speaker 1>knowing much about Mr Weekes true </v>
<v Speaker 1>business practices or even about the </v>

62
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>superior quality of the starbucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

63
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have that blend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raw sewage taste that tweaks coffee.</v>

64
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:08.164
<v Speaker 1>Has the people of South Park demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>a programmatic response that boils down </v>

65
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>to simply small business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good big corporation back.</v>

66
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.423
<v Speaker 1>Does it matter if the big corporation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an ethical business and if the </v>

67
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>children in question are foul mouth hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>raisers,</v>

68
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.673
<v Speaker 1>no it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's thanks to a principle called </v>

69
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.703
<v Speaker 1>the backfire effect which says the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation of any new and contrary </v>

70
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>information will be dismissed outright </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatens your basic belief structure.</v>

71
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Try arguing with people on facebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>about politics.</v>

72
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>We're confident you'll change their </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

73
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>The gnomes episode of South Park </v>
<v Speaker 1>lampoons.</v>

74
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>This idea of hardwired biases by </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating small businesses just like</v>

75
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>small children can be just as scummy as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their larger counterparts.</v>

76
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>They're just not as prolific about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because after all,</v>

77
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.333
<v Speaker 1>as the underpants gnomes of the episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>adorably demonstrate both small and </v>

78
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:04.564
<v Speaker 1>large businesses are geared towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a profit even if there might be </v>

79
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>some ambiguity about the path toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>that objective,</v>

80
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.570
<v Speaker 3>collect underpants.</v>

81
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.723
<v Speaker 1>Where are the gnomes episode satirizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation of children for emotional </v>

82
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>sympathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cash for gold,</v>

83
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>satirizes the exploitation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elderly for massive profit,</v>

84
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.563
<v Speaker 1>and how better to demonstrate this con </v>
<v Speaker 1>inaction then by way of the home </v>

85
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>shopping network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this episode stand learns his Grandpa</v>

86
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.524
<v Speaker 1>has routinely fallen victim to </v>
<v Speaker 1>television scams that are draining his </v>

87
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>retirement funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

88
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Cartman's rank opportunism drives him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of those same scams,</v>

89
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>to feed his insatiable greed from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two angles.</v>

90
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:51.454
<v Speaker 1>Cash for Gold examines both the Predator</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the prey through the lens of value </v>

91
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:55.834
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different theories of value </v>

92
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:57.994
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard the kind dictated </v>

93
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.364
<v Speaker 1>by supply and demand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but value might not necessarily be a </v>

94
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>financial value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead be rooted in social,</v>

95
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>emotional or historical value and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>like financial value,</v>

96
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.983
<v Speaker 1>these alternatives can be situational </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fluid entering on a variety of </v>

97
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic and extrinsic factors.</v>

98
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After stands,</v>

99
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>grandpa give Stan a bolo tie that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought off the TV for $6,000.</v>

100
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.393
<v Speaker 1>Stand almost immediately learns that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very same tie is worth $15 at the local </v>

101
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>appraiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you $15.</v>

102
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 1>Then after pursuing third and fourth </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions stand watches the Bolo Tie </v>

103
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>diminish and financial value right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before his very eyes,</v>

104
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>until it's worth no more than a seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>layer burrito at Taco bell.</v>

105
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>My grandpa paid $6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something barely worth anything.</v>

106
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>How does something like this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To answer stands?</v>

107
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:49.714
<v Speaker 1>Question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode introduces us to multiple </v>

108
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:52.414
<v Speaker 1>forms of value beginning with the market</v>
<v Speaker 1>value displayed on the home shopping </v>

109
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Dean,</v>

110
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.184
<v Speaker 1>the home shopping network hosts uses his</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority to convince his elderly </v>

111
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting amazing deals.</v>

112
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Those same viewers reliably line dean's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets.</v>

113
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Even though what he's selling is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame of material or resale value,</v>

114
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>pretty much a piece of crap.</v>

115
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Look at these stunning airings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are genuine fo Sapphire earrings,</v>

116
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>14 carat gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>86 karat photo sapphire.</v>

117
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>This disconnect is the very mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that drives any great scam,</v>

118
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.293
<v Speaker 1>high perceived value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>married to low actual value where a </v>

119
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.434
<v Speaker 1>purely labor oriented view of economics </v>
<v Speaker 1>might consider the work that went into </v>

120
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.544
<v Speaker 1>producing an item.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park here exhibits a more nuanced </v>

121
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:37.784
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that proposes value is determined </v>

122
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>not by quality or by effort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>

123
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.913
<v Speaker 1>but by the nature of supply and demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And boy does dean know how to drive and </v>

124
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>exploit that demand at that price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You practically stolen from us.</v>

125
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Ouch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And later when Stan urges dean to commit</v>

126
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should carry yourself.</v>

127
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.733
<v Speaker 1>Dean is able to conceptualize his life's</v>
<v Speaker 1>work only in the monetary figure it </v>

128
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>might draw in a lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two point $7,000,000</v>

129
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>for dean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's literally no useful value beyond</v>

130
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.164
<v Speaker 1>the financial freedom of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how much cash he can squeeze from </v>

131
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>people's wallets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

132
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>we clearly see the impact of emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

133
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 1>When stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandpa tells the story of his dog.</v>

134
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.873
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did I ever tell you I used to have a </v>

135
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.530
<v Speaker 4>border collie named patches?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

136
00:07:25.531 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 4>grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that dog.</v>

137
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 4>She always made me so happy when she </v>
<v Speaker 4>died.</v>

138
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.333
<v Speaker 4>I didn't let myself get too sad because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought thought I'd always have the </v>

139
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:42.081
<v Speaker 4>memory of her slobbery and happy face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what she looked like.</v>

140
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Billy,</v>

141
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.173
<v Speaker 1>through this monologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learn GRANDPA's reckless purchases </v>

142
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>have little to do with the perceived </v>
<v Speaker 1>market value of the items in question.</v>

143
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.223
<v Speaker 1>No GRANDPA is trying to add emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>and historical value to himself by </v>

144
00:07:55.951 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 1>creating memories and sentimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections that will last long past his</v>

145
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:01.770
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elsewhere in the story,</v>

146
00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:02.604
<v Speaker 1>we learned these fluid and disparate </v>
<v Speaker 1>notions of value call into question the </v>

147
00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:06.444
<v Speaker 1>true value of nearly everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the perceived cultural value of </v>

148
00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:10.824
<v Speaker 1>an academy award evaporate as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply melted down to be resold in new </v>

149
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:15.684
<v Speaker 1>forms stands gift to his grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A framed photo of Grandpa with his </v>

150
00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:23.100
<v Speaker 1>beloved dog arguably has astronomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional value,</v>

151
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but low market value thing completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means a lot and GRANDPA's six grand</v>

152
00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:31.350
<v Speaker 1>gift to Stan is ultimately written off </v>
<v Speaker 1>as being</v>

153
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.610
<v Speaker 4>gay gay,</v>

154
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

155
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>just how loose is that relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between labor and profit.</v>

156
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>That question sits at the foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>go fund yourself,</v>

157
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>an episode in which the South Park kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched a successful brand that doesn't</v>

158
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>even bother to put a business behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A startup company,</v>

159
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.770
<v Speaker 1>a company that does what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

160
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

161
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>the official slogan of their company is </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking,</v>

162
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.074
<v Speaker 1>can make their business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ultimately calls itself The </v>

163
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.124
<v Speaker 1>Washington redskins draws at success </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bastardization of modern </v>

164
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>kickstarter culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting monetary donations in exchange</v>

165
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:14.091
<v Speaker 1>for no effort at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we cut throat.</v>

166
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>The episode southpark suggests that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the advent of twitter,</v>

167
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Instagram,</v>

168
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.903
<v Speaker 1>the success of a brand or company can </v>
<v Speaker 1>now be routed purely in its appearance </v>

169
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.073
<v Speaker 1>rather than its function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the central arguments of this </v>

170
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.044
<v Speaker 1>episode is that what a business does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>less valuable to that business then the </v>

171
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:32.544
<v Speaker 1>relative power of its brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Stan sets off to find the perfect </v>

172
00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:38.914
<v Speaker 1>startup name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this moment carries more important than </v>

173
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.380
<v Speaker 1>any objective pursued by Cartman's </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

174
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 3>It's the greatest startup company name </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

175
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.310
<v Speaker 3>What Washington Red Skins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's taken carmen,</v>

176
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis,</v>

177
00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 1>mirrors and argument made by </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>

178
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.203
<v Speaker 1>John Boatyard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who argued in 1981 simulacra and </v>

179
00:09:57.561 --> 00:09:58.394
<v Speaker 1>simulations that all previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions of value had been woefully </v>

180
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:02.564
<v Speaker 1>inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boatyards work presented that value </v>

181
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.533
<v Speaker 1>isn't determined by how much work has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone into making something or by the </v>

182
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:11.510
<v Speaker 1>nature of it's materials or by its </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall usefulness.</v>

183
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.710
<v Speaker 1>No value is determined purely as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance of value.</v>

184
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.690
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to beaudry art,</v>

185
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.553
<v Speaker 1>an item or brand is only valued as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists as an image in relation to other </v>

186
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:23.774
<v Speaker 1>things that are also images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Value then is determined only in the </v>

187
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:27.764
<v Speaker 1>relationship that exists between things </v>
<v Speaker 1>or among a set of things through this </v>

188
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:32.474
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more important for a business to </v>

189
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:36.830
<v Speaker 1>have a great brand than it is to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>great stuff.</v>

190
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It's more important to be trendy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors than it is to make fat.</v>

191
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Stacks of cash.</v>

192
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Uber being worth billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>while still losing billions of dollars.</v>

193
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baudrillard more or less predicted that </v>

194
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.850
<v Speaker 1>decades ago in Gofund yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The South Park kids take this concept of</v>

195
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 1>value to absurd heights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like the protagonist of Hbo,</v>

196
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:57.264
<v Speaker 1>his entourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they embrace the idea that the ultimate </v>

197
00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:01.970
<v Speaker 1>success lies in not doing anything at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

198
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Just startup cash instead out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro down,</v>

199
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.240
<v Speaker 1>but we still gotta love them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like so many in the real world,</v>

200
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>the south park kids are just squirrels </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a nut.</v>

201
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Today's economy is awash with side </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hustles,</v>

202
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.760
<v Speaker 1>independent contractors and guest </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecturers,</v>

203
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but economic power lies not with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says South Park.</v>

204
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It sits with the fat cats at the top who</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to work the system with minimal</v>

205
00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:25.544
<v Speaker 1>effort or does it ultimately the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington redskins venture is left in </v>

206
00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 1>shambles because of the brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missteps on a social issue.</v>

207
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing sweet about people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are decimated.</v>

208
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.243
<v Speaker 1>Here are the episode argues that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business built only on aesthetics has </v>

209
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:43.250
<v Speaker 1>nowhere to turn and no foundational </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs to hold two.</v>

210
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.203
<v Speaker 1>Once public opinion turns against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out even a business that does </v>

211
00:11:47.571 --> 00:11:48.404
<v Speaker 1>almost nothing can be threatened by </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing or saying or being the wrong </v>

212
00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time in South Park,</v>

213
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.833
<v Speaker 1>that outcome leaves our young </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs faded to the worst </v>

214
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:03.421
<v Speaker 1>punishment of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we got to go back to ski scratch</v>

215
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:05.644
<v Speaker 1>that there is in fact a worse punishment</v>
<v Speaker 1>than going to school and it arrives at </v>

216
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>the forefront of the episode titled You </v>
<v Speaker 1>Have Zero Friends.</v>

217
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.753
<v Speaker 1>This episode examines the absurdities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our growing social media economy as in </v>

218
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 1>the cash for gold adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park here tackles head on the true</v>

219
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>meaning of value.</v>

220
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Looking on facebook today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see that since adding a loser,</v>

221
00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 3>kip droughty as a friend dominic,</v>

222
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.113
<v Speaker 1>are our friendships and social worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured by our likes and facebook </v>

223
00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:33.254
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are they determined by the </v>

224
00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:35.324
<v Speaker 1>interactions we share in what the cyber </v>
<v Speaker 1>punk community derisively refers to as </v>

225
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.020
<v Speaker 1>space from the outset of the episode are</v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonists,</v>

226
00:12:42.021 --> 00:12:46.310
<v Speaker 1>stand side by side in the meat space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate their respective levels of social</v>

227
00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:50.780
<v Speaker 1>status as quantified solely by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>collections of online friendships.</v>

228
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any friends</v>

229
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.853
<v Speaker 1>in this framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook friendships like money create </v>

230
00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 1>an easily measurable hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal value.</v>

231
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.033
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't seem to get my friend </v>

232
00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:05.760
<v Speaker 3>numbers to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is,</v>

233
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:08.370
<v Speaker 3>as long as you have that Kip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordy luther is a facebook friend,</v>

234
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.260
<v Speaker 3>people view your friendship as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>liability.</v>

235
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.393
<v Speaker 3>You've got to dump him.</v>

236
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.273
<v Speaker 1>Cartman unsurprisingly sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships not as intrinsically </v>

237
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:16.234
<v Speaker 1>joyful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as status symbols by which to </v>

238
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:21.990
<v Speaker 1>elevate some people over others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this calls to mind beaudry again,</v>

239
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should because in his work,</v>

240
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the consumer society yard warned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of enhancing life,</v>

241
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.863
<v Speaker 1>a transactional approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships leads to an individual </v>

242
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:32.284
<v Speaker 1>lack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since everything possessed is </v>

243
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:34.144
<v Speaker 1>relativized in relation to others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartman's troubling view of </v>

244
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 1>relationships begins to infect even </v>
<v Speaker 1>kyle.</v>

245
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>When Kyle's digital farm is depleted due</v>
<v Speaker 1>to economic hardship,</v>

246
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.320
<v Speaker 1>he turns to his long time meetspace </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

247
00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even after Stan has offered kyle his</v>

248
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 1>real world support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kyle can think about is how much his</v>

249
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>own social media cache must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

250
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Just so confused that I really need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend right now.</v>

251
00:13:59.250 --> 00:13:59.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

252
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for you Kay,</v>

253
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>so then get on facebook and fertilize my</v>
<v Speaker 1>crops.</v>

254
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kyle drops the suite,</v>

255
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:07.054
<v Speaker 1>but socially toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kip from his own roster of facebook </v>

256
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>friends in order to salvage his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>social standing south park asks,</v>

257
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.103
<v Speaker 1>who are we really when our online </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence outweighs our real world </v>

258
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:18.094
<v Speaker 1>engagements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he insists her relationship with </v>

259
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be validated on the Internet,</v>

260
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.563
<v Speaker 1>and even randy doesn't believe in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection with his own son until Stan </v>

261
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>agrees to add him on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not your friend.</v>

262
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.493
<v Speaker 1>Then</v>

263
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are my friend,</v>

264
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but you just don't want to add me as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend</v>

265
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.320
<v Speaker 3>that it's just a stupid click of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>button that takes two seconds,</v>

266
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have the two seconds or in</v>

267
00:14:40.461 --> 00:14:44.750
<v Speaker 1>our reality and in south park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this disjunction between our digital and</v>

268
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:45.584
<v Speaker 1>real world lives threatens to place a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater premium on our digital behavior </v>

269
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and it makes our physical life seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant and less like an experience.</v>

270
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.713
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why kyle pushes back against </v>

271
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>friendships with real people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing kip.</v>

272
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.393
<v Speaker 1>When doing so means preserving his </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital status and while everyone else </v>

273
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>is trying to pump up their digital lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the expense of their meetspace lives.</v>

274
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.163
<v Speaker 1>Pour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kip is desperately trying to force his </v>

275
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 1>digital friendship into the meat space </v>
<v Speaker 1>world by taking his laptop to the movies</v>

276
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>for the argument in favor of cultivation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an online brand is as simple as it is</v>

277
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:23.594
<v Speaker 1>daunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it may not be as authentic as </v>

278
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the quote unquote real you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your profile,</v>

<v Speaker 1>net than you do alone.</v>

280
