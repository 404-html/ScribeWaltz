1
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.763
<v Speaker 1>Very Pale flesh again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we watched Netflix is new death note </v>

2
00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>movie this weekend and thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>merited some discussion.</v>

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.483
<v Speaker 1>And of course some spoilers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watched our video on the death </v>

4
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:15.024
<v Speaker 1>note anime a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that we're big fans of the </v>

5
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draws out incredibly nuanced ideas about</v>

6
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>the nature of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.543
<v Speaker 1>and even participates in it's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical dialogue throughout the </v>

10
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just damn good television,</v>

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly good cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

13
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.124
<v Speaker 1>off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say that adapting at 37 </v>

14
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>episode animate to a single movie is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone hired me to do that,</v>

16
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.074
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not here to grade how closely </v>

17
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>the new film sticks to the anime or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monga.</v>

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It's an adaptation and it deserves some </v>
<v Speaker 1>room to do its own thing.</v>

19
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at the film on its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely got some good things </v>
<v Speaker 1>going for it.</v>

21
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that I most admire is its </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to preserve some of the thematic</v>

22
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.374
<v Speaker 1>richness of the anime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an impressive goal for a 100 </v>

23
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>minute movie that already packs in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>action sequences,</v>

24
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.054
<v Speaker 1>detective games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gore and teen romance from lights </v>

25
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>argument that his systematic cheating is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

26
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at homework here for at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least 15 different students.</v>

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

28
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm trying to say is you have the </v>

29
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>chance to stop the type of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things hard for everybody.</v>

30
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:27.654
<v Speaker 1>You've got to see the big picture here </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his conversation with his dad at the </v>

31
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:30.714
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death note tries to put some moral </v>

32
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>ambiguity into lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

33
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>and gesture to bigger questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of good and evil.</v>

34
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.663
<v Speaker 1>Given the time constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was smart not to attempt the massive </v>

35
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>discourses on justice that we see in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anime,</v>

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.233
<v Speaker 1>but the film makes clear that it's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in ethics just in a </v>

37
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>simplified form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

38
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Can I do with this death now and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

39
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.673
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the film gets itself into </v>

40
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toward the beginning.</v>

41
00:01:59.071 --> 00:01:59.904
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turner tells light guns is only as good </v>

42
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>as the Jameson I make sure people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust are here.</v>

43
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.893
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about the role of the </v>

44
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:08.664
<v Speaker 1>Seattle police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but light seems to adopt a similar </v>

45
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>principle using the power of the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>

46
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.794
<v Speaker 1>He liked his animate counterpart wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a new world where innocent </v>

47
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>civilians are protected from the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who make life miserable.</v>

48
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>The death note is his gun and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim.</v>

49
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Although he gets squeamish about </v>
<v Speaker 1>offering some law enforcement,</v>

50
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>we never really see light compromising </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intentions behind that aim until his</v>

51
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>David Copperfield reveal at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film.</v>

52
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.503
<v Speaker 1>Instead they bring in a seductive power </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry girlfriend to play the role of </v>

53
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:41.004
<v Speaker 1>bad cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For 90% of the movie light is </v>

54
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.183
<v Speaker 1>unambiguously the good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least be kind of okay guy and </v>

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.833
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kira largely had the support of the </v>

56
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:56.241
<v Speaker 1>people including the police until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of the FBI team and who sent eight</v>

57
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:57.564
<v Speaker 1>federal agents walking off a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The duplicitous mia who stole the </v>

58
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>notebook from light and wrote his name </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

59
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad me.</v>

60
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Who killed what tare by not burning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>page with his name on it.</v>

61
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.433
<v Speaker 1>We're clearly supposed to blame me up </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though light put it there in the </v>

62
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:16.440
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the film spends next to no time</v>

63
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>developing what light wants out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>new world,</v>

64
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.763
<v Speaker 1>he's still shockingly quick to abandon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and once someone dies who hasn't </v>

65
00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:25.680
<v Speaker 1>committed a felony or stolen someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch money,</v>

66
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>you really think people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their needs.</v>

67
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.480
<v Speaker 1>If you can talk to her like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not killing my dad mia.</v>

68
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.210
<v Speaker 1>This is overview just we're not the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys anymore.</v>

69
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 1>We aren't the good guys anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds a lot more like people don't like</v>

70
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:37.034
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then an actual statement about cure is </v>

71
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.140
<v Speaker 1>morality of rule and while the third act</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the film tries to play up,</v>

72
00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:42.974
<v Speaker 1>the difference between lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reluctance to kill people and bad meals </v>

73
00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:46.754
<v Speaker 1>bloodthirstiness lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts seems more pragmatic than </v>

74
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:50.564
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lights change of perspective isn't an </v>

75
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>indication that there was ever problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his plan for becoming a God.</v>

76
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.853
<v Speaker 1>Just that the circumstances have changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't really want to go to </v>

77
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:01.304
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mia doesn't really mind if a gun is </v>

78
00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:04.814
<v Speaker 1>only as good as its aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the film should be asking </v>

79
00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>questions about lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim with the death note,</v>

80
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.060
<v Speaker 1>but instead of saying be careful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming your gun in this direction,</v>

81
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.163
<v Speaker 1>it's more make sure your crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend doesn't get ahold of your </v>

82
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.700
<v Speaker 1>L's quick personality flip from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't kill,</v>

84
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:24.534
<v Speaker 1>I just bring justice to I might kill you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same way you killed hundreds of </v>

85
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>people seems to be totally dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

86
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.793
<v Speaker 1>The detective strong moral framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed since childhood gets tossed </v>

87
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>away instantly when his friend goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing,</v>

88
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's no emphasis on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of that change.</v>

89
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Light ends the film by telling his dad,</v>

90
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 2>first I was just going to kill all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guys and good guys.</v>

91
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you got to choose the lesser </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the two years,</v>

92
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 1>but what are these two evils?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is that not even light notes,</v>

93
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.450
<v Speaker 1>unlike the animate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

94
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.710
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to say it.</v>

95
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.933
<v Speaker 1>Death notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethical ambiguity is less about opening </v>

96
00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 1>a multitude of possibilities and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>about shrugging in the direction of good</v>

97
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:16.970
<v Speaker 1>and evil while ultimately saying nothing</v>

98
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.333
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

99
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

100
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.253
<v Speaker 1>condensing an animate of that magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a relatively short film is a </v>

101
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 1>difficult task and I won't begrudge the </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers some reductions in depth,</v>

102
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.713
<v Speaker 1>but what the story clone to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>hutchins about good and evil was poorly </v>

103
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:40.514
<v Speaker 1>executed and ended up hamstringing its </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential both philosophically and </v>

104
00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:45.740
<v Speaker 1>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

105
00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.574
<v Speaker 1>those are our thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still experimenting with this new </v>

106
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:49.424
<v Speaker 1>quick take format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you have thoughts on what we </v>

107
00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>should cover next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us know these guys.</v>

108
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking for more wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick takes on the latest,</v>
