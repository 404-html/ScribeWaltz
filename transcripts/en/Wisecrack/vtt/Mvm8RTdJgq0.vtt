1
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared again.</v>

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocelot enthusiasts.</v>

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Mallory Archer and his crew of snarky </v>
<v Speaker 1>foul mouth spies,</v>

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.563
<v Speaker 1>Archer is sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight seasons worth of comedy would be </v>

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>occasional drastic reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we form a cartel,</v>

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>how hard could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what makes archer work?</v>

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.863
<v Speaker 1>What's its secret sauce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does watching it feel like a </v>

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>familiar experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as the show takes absurd leaps that</v>

10
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>would probably kill off any other show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer succeeds by inverting rules,</v>

11
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:35.724
<v Speaker 1>characters and narrative tropes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spies genre while using sound and </v>

12
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:39.834
<v Speaker 1>language gags to build a unique arsenal </v>
<v Speaker 1>of humor that explores deeper </v>

13
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>character's psychology.</v>

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Mrs J.</v>

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Welcome</v>

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>this wise crack addition on archer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always spoilers ahead,</v>

17
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.043
<v Speaker 1>it should be no surprise that archer </v>
<v Speaker 1>borrows plenty of the magic elements </v>

18
00:00:58.751 --> 00:00:59.584
<v Speaker 1>from James Bond and slash or hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these gags are more than just a </v>

19
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>shallow nod to double o seven bond films</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly pit.</v>

20
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>The freewheeling titular stood against </v>
<v Speaker 1>these stuffy,</v>

21
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>boring rule makers best exemplified by </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

22
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.263
<v Speaker 1>To understand why this is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to look at what was going on in </v>

23
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>America during the meteoric rise of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>James Bond series.</v>

24
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>According to sociologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Andre,</v>

25
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>this time period was a crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity in which the male desire for</v>

26
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.194
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and independence was displaced </v>
<v Speaker 1>by pressure to sell out for a desk job </v>

27
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:30.934
<v Speaker 1>with a 401k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving many a man feeling like an </v>

28
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>alienated but conforming employee of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large corporate bureaucracy.</v>

29
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.043
<v Speaker 1>Spy Thrillers emerged as the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of escapism with the character of </v>

30
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:41.974
<v Speaker 1>James Bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplifying the ideals of independence </v>

31
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.763
<v Speaker 1>agency and individualism that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise the lacking in the day to day </v>

32
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>life of most American men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonds,</v>

33
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.464
<v Speaker 1>characterization as a chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>rulebreaker who relied on his charisma </v>

34
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and sheer guts to succeed made him the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect hero for the time.</v>

35
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be bond style.</v>

36
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Secret agent is a complete fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reportedly.</v>

37
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>After viewing a James Bond film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA officers would ask questions like,</v>

38
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>why wasn't bond required to prepare an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expense report throughout the series?</v>

39
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:11.164
<v Speaker 1>Archer takes this question and milks the</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor of the unglamorous espionage </v>

40
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For all it's worth.</v>

41
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Forgot the balance in my God damn cow </v>
<v Speaker 2>date of employment or</v>

42
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>mindless paperwork occupies a central </v>
<v Speaker 1>role on the show.</v>

43
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Frequently threatening archers ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live his best spy life.</v>

44
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 2>You turned in an expense report from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Berlin with the German desk,</v>

45
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 2>says you've never checked in Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too busy to chose.</v>

46
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

47
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.553
<v Speaker 1>the show contrast the fantastical action</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequences with the Monday and ease of </v>

48
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>office life to amazing comic effect</v>

49
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 4>beneficiary on my company life </v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance.</v>

50
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.403
<v Speaker 1>Even when archer does escape the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic ramifications of his </v>

51
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only because of his boss,</v>

52
00:02:58.641 --> 00:02:59.474
<v Speaker 1>mom mallory's forgiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later in the series when the agency </v>

53
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.674
<v Speaker 1>becomes a private investigation firm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyril is the only one eligible for a Pi </v>

54
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

55
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>archer has to suffer the indignity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for the figures agency.</v>

56
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>While a character like Cyril prospers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of espionage,</v>

57
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.160
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archers,</v>

58
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>swashbuckling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antics are usually counterproductive.</v>

59
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't see what could possibly go wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a quick note on Cyril,</v>

60
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.883
<v Speaker 1>whereas some might associate paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushers like him with emasculated </v>

61
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>stooges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyril is instead addicted to sex.</v>

62
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

63
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hypersexualized.</v>

64
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I need a spanking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archers.</v>

65
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate James Bond parody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about machismo,</v>

66
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>exemplifying the qualities he's best </v>
<v Speaker 1>known for,</v>

67
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:41.944
<v Speaker 1>and then taking them to their logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>unromantic conclusion like bond archer </v>

68
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>is wild and untamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using drinking,</v>

69
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.440
<v Speaker 1>fighting womanizing cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and guns to affirm his manliness.</v>

70
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.433
<v Speaker 1>You want to see who's a big boy grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The decades bond films have fetishize </v>

71
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>the latest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexiest car.</v>

72
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.393
<v Speaker 1>Aston Martin sponsored 12 of the 24 bond</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies usually offering promotional </v>

73
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>deals to let fan boys live out their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream of buying a bond car.</v>

74
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.493
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archers car is a birthday gift from his </v>

75
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.524
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented to him as if it's his super </v>

76
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>sweet 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

77
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.733
<v Speaker 1>Adding to the adolescent field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car gives archer and embarrassing </v>

78
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>erection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

79
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.604
<v Speaker 1>He's got an erection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show mocks the way that bonds </v>

80
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:31.684
<v Speaker 1>hypermasculinity was and still is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sell products like cars and beer to </v>

81
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>men who want to embody the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities,</v>

82
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.730
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>special agent addition brought to you by</v>

83
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 1>dodge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dodge,</v>

84
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.153
<v Speaker 1>then go for the best of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archers car may be a marker of his </v>

85
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:48.664
<v Speaker 1>manliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one that's on loan from Mommy </v>

86
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>who confiscates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Days later,</v>

87
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be supposed masculine power of archer is</v>

88
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>yanked away by his more powerful mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Bond is one of cinemas,</v>

89
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>most famous eductors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

90
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>archer is hypersexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly hiring sex workers,</v>

91
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>sleeping with every office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mate.</v>

92
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:09.964
<v Speaker 1>Would you please come in this dirty </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet stall and have sex with me and </v>

93
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>propositioning every woman with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating pulse and some without.</v>

94
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Could you close your eyes?</v>

95
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I kind of feel like I'm banging tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights on a country road.</v>

96
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while bond sexual prowess is legendary,</v>

97
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>archers is less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

98
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

99
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

100
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I weights by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes one of us,</v>

101
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>and while bond sex life come seemingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>without physical consequences.</v>

102
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Archer frequently comes down with stds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and has to pay for abortions.</v>

103
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for other health effects of the bond</v>

104
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>in lifestyle are also taken to a logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

105
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Wild James Bond is known to enjoy his </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquor.</v>

106
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Archers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Substance use is super human.</v>

107
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he literally chugged germicide.</v>

108
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.483
<v Speaker 1>His drinking appears to play at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>some role in him getting these Feminine </v>

109
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Disease of Breast Cancer and a history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of alcoholism,</v>

110
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I drink socially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

112
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.423
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly the stuff of a double o playboy </v>

113
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.083
<v Speaker 1>before archer undergoes chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has some of his sperm frozen later </v>

114
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:13.684
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of secretly uses that sperm to </v>

115
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:15.934
<v Speaker 1>become pregnant and have his baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>without his permission or even his </v>

116
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:24.031
<v Speaker 1>knowledge for the oblivious archer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even becoming a father somehow plays out</v>

117
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:25.084
<v Speaker 1>as a twisted form of emasculation cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the only health ramifications of </v>

118
00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:30.184
<v Speaker 1>archer secret agent lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also tonight is a hearing loss </v>

119
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.710
<v Speaker 1>caused by too many damn guns going off </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

120
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Either James Bond is always wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>earplugs or his craters.</v>

121
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Ignore the pesky realities of inner ear </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

122
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.633
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archer and his crew even solidify </v>

123
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:44.864
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>us as the show's pet cause attending an </v>

124
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>annual fundraiser for the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinnitus Association.</v>

125
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.553
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archer subverts the bulletproof James </v>

126
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.253
<v Speaker 1>Bond and fantasy by dragging archer into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bleakest realities of his mortal </v>

127
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:57.010
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

128
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.790
<v Speaker 1>But is there something more to archers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hearing loss communication scholar.</v>

129
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so in his essay,</v>

130
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.083
<v Speaker 1>archer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spy parody for the ears dot argues </v>

131
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that archers tonight is is more than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing gag.</v>

132
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.813
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an important aspect of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show's preoccupation with sound and </v>

133
00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:13.654
<v Speaker 1>language which are both used to generate</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs and to provide deeper insights </v>

134
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:17.944
<v Speaker 1>into character psychology to prove this </v>
<v Speaker 1>doc conducted a study in which he </v>

135
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>watched every episode of archers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third and fourth seasons,</v>

136
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.603
<v Speaker 1>and counted the number of linguistic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound specific references including </v>

137
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:28.564
<v Speaker 1>language jokes like puns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign language references or loud </v>

138
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>gunfire followed by the high pitched </v>
<v Speaker 1>ringing of archers.</v>

139
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Tinnitus dot found that such references </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred on average 10 times per episode</v>

140
00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:40.870
<v Speaker 1>in the third season and 11 times in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>

141
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.970
<v Speaker 1>which comes out to approximately once </v>
<v Speaker 1>every two minutes just as mundane office</v>

142
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:49.870
<v Speaker 1>politics serve as a humorous contrast to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life threatening action sequences.</v>

143
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.763
<v Speaker 1>The show's language jokes are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>employed at the most inopportune </v>

144
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:54.544
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take special interest in one of </v>

145
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:02.260
<v Speaker 1>the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simplest ongoing gags.</v>

146
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 5>Bada Bada</v>

147
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.723
<v Speaker 1>archers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frequent act of calling out loudly to </v>

148
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Elana even when she is nearby is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just a simple annoyance.</v>

149
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 1>It's reminiscent of a baby calling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for its mother,</v>

150
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.700
<v Speaker 1>which for Archer probably never quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave him the comfort he needed.</v>

151
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>

152
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.113
<v Speaker 1>Essentially archers increasingly louder </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeals to signal his inability to </v>

153
00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:28.254
<v Speaker 1>control his demand for attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually other characters adopt the </v>

154
00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:33.380
<v Speaker 1>same gag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pam,</v>

155
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>based on the growing frequency of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeals for attention,</v>

156
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Nga says clearly it is very important in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this show for characters to be heard.</v>

157
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.653
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also seems to be important that they </v>

158
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>not be hurt too quickly by the listener </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing up the rooms of power,</v>

159
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>demand control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychological repression.</v>

160
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take archers,</v>

161
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>classic phrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

162
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want to freshen up after your </v>
<v Speaker 1>long ride raising mother?</v>

163
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>This is a classic use of what Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Double Entendre in which the joke</v>

164
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>depends quite specially on the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

165
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>even though the words have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>

166
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:08.784
<v Speaker 1>nonsexual meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that these sorts of jokes </v>

167
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>were way to release some of the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy that comes from repressing sexual</v>

168
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:15.594
<v Speaker 1>or aggressive desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's particularly significant when </v>

169
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:18.864
<v Speaker 1>archers aiming the joke at his mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>for whom he has more than an inkling of </v>

170
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:27.081
<v Speaker 1>an oedipal complex clone of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead gives you know just half of one,</v>

171
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 1>but beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when archer says phrasing,</v>

172
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.343
<v Speaker 1>he's essentially choosing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>miscommunicate and willfully </v>

173
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>misinterpreting the speaker's words.</v>

174
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.233
<v Speaker 1>Thus derailing the conversation by </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing to only hear the sexual </v>

175
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:39.864
<v Speaker 1>innuendo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer often ensures that the person </v>

176
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>won't be hurt at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm a bad listener.</v>

177
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>The tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they quickly becomes one of archers.</v>

178
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Favorite ways of hijacking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

179
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.583
<v Speaker 1>As language tends to do phrasing spreads</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the other characters start adopting </v>

180
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming so quickly.</v>

181
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke eventually become so ubiquitous</v>

182
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>that it actually circles back and falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of fashion like Yolo or on fleek.</v>

183
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.703
<v Speaker 1>Archers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety over the plummeting popularity </v>

184
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:06.984
<v Speaker 1>of his favorite joke only confirms how </v>
<v Speaker 1>important these attention grabbing </v>

185
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:10.734
<v Speaker 1>antiques are to his identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's image of a perfect man </v>

186
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.213
<v Speaker 1>reduced to a manchild phrasing isn't the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way to avoid hearing what a </v>

187
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>character usually his mother is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

188
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.683
<v Speaker 1>Take the running gag about archers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voicemail messages which become </v>

189
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:24.834
<v Speaker 1>increasingly elaborate ruses to trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother into thinking she's actually </v>

190
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>speaking to him.</v>

191
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Sterling Sterling listened very </v>
<v Speaker 1>voicemail as a result.</v>

192
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Mallory has entire conversations with is</v>
<v Speaker 1>prerecorded voice before realizing she's</v>

193
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:38.664
<v Speaker 1>been duped here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer is taking great pleasure in the </v>

194
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:43.650
<v Speaker 1>power he's able to wield in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with his mother.</v>

195
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 1>This voice message gag is archers </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

196
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.513
<v Speaker 1>If juvenile means of temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>reclaiming some power momentarily </v>

197
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 1>undermining mallory's dominance over </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

198
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to just as archer has trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>bending to the will of Isis.</v>

199
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:01.314
<v Speaker 1>As human resource department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often find themselves struggling </v>

200
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.840
<v Speaker 1>with the rules of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned that flammable and inflammable</v>

201
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:07.674
<v Speaker 1>mean the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both restraints prevent archer from </v>

202
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>living the bad ass spy narrative he </v>
<v Speaker 1>envisions for himself.</v>

203
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>One such example occurs in the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>part series,</v>

204
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>heart of archness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Archer has declared himself king of</v>

205
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.044
<v Speaker 1>the pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he attempts to address his subjects </v>

206
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>through his translator slash slave noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

207
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

208
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>take a knee.</v>

209
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>That won't translate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like last week when you said,</v>

210
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:30.030
<v Speaker 1>lend me your ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>

211
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.770
<v Speaker 1>damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do idiom.</v>

212
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

213
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Archer attempts to convey his message </v>
<v Speaker 1>without these idioms,</v>

214
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but quickly finds it impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

215
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I never realized how much we rely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>

216
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.073
<v Speaker 1>You'll win this round here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer shapes against the rules of </v>

217
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>language just like he chafes against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of bureaucracy,</v>

218
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but even when he's not dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient language gaps,</v>

219
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.240
<v Speaker 1>archer still has trouble expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

220
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:58.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still got that stemer.</v>

221
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>While James Bond is well known for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>pithy,</v>

222
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:02.014
<v Speaker 1>one liners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer is not so gifted between his </v>

223
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:06.184
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frequently regretting his failure to </v>

224
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:09.120
<v Speaker 1>come up with the perfect witty line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

225
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got something for this.</v>

226
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Hush puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>

227
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>That's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

228
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.163
<v Speaker 1>Archer parodies bond by turning his </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny offhanded Innuendos into a chore </v>

229
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>in which Archer Still Comes up.</v>

230
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Short operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about I rescue,</v>

231
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Ilana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she begs me to take her back so then</v>

232
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swear to God.</v>

233
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I had something at other times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archers language isolates him,</v>

234
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.733
<v Speaker 1>particularly when he's attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with others over his favorite </v>

235
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:35.884
<v Speaker 1>obscure cultural references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer not to Bartleby the </v>

236
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>scrivener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody?</v>

237
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Not a big Melville crowd here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

238
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 1>While he's constantly grasping to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard and to impress through his brain,</v>

239
00:12:47.941 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 1>he call outs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rarely receives any affirmation.</v>

240
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.933
<v Speaker 1>Why am I William Sapphire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always disappointing to have your </v>

241
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.534
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful cultural references fall flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not even the greatest spy in this </v>

242
00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 1>fictional cartoon land is immune to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>

243
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.893
<v Speaker 1>Read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archers chock full of fantastical fight </v>

244
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:04.954
<v Speaker 1>sequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildly ambitious spy missions and </v>

245
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily complicated weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

246
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.443
<v Speaker 1>but much of the show's humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest in the linguistic communications </v>

247
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 1>between the characters I honestly have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no response to that is lingering.</v>

248
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:17.854
<v Speaker 1>Adolescent sense of being an outsider </v>
<v Speaker 1>formed over and impressive 15 years </v>

249
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:22.114
<v Speaker 1>spent at boarding school are perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed and his over enthusiasm for </v>

250
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:26.014
<v Speaker 1>coining group slang and his wildly </v>
<v Speaker 1>obscure pop culture references that </v>

251
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 1>inevitably fall flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of all,</v>

252
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.223
<v Speaker 1>archer embodies the perennial secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>agent struggle born out of the 19 </v>

253
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:35.944
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine anxiety about being cogs in </v>

254
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 1>the corporate machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you guys think?</v>

255
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.610

<v Speaker 1>listen?</v>

256
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.370
