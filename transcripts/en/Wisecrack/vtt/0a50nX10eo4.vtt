<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole communities kind of turned </v>

5
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>upside down looking for the shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.283
<v Speaker 1>one of the people who didn't get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message that he's not supposed to live </v>

7
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:31.691
<v Speaker 1>in the lower east side anymore is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>junkie who,</v>

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees a crime,</v>

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.233
<v Speaker 1>a crime of opportunity and snatches a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag in front of Schiller's and tries to </v>

10
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>he gets grabbed by the bouncer and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing he says in a panic is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that white kid.</v>

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.883
<v Speaker 1>And so they have to track him down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the night to see the </v>

14
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>catching detective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's this guy,</v>

15
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Mattie Clark,</v>

<v Speaker 1>or Mattie Clark.</v>

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And there's a guy named Iacono who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another cop who basically lives in,</v>

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>in the windowless bunk room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been for six months,</v>

<v Speaker 1>into the bunk room.</v>

22
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.903
<v Speaker 1>So this is about three o'clock in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and this is taking place in an </v>

25
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>the restraint bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are doing so well,</v>
