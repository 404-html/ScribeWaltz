00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack.</v>

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Not a pickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here and today we're breaking down</v>

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>the season finale of rick and morty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Season three in this season,</v>

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.253
<v Speaker 1>especially rick and Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to flump the meaninglessness </v>

8
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>of our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets it.</v>

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you think matters matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is special.</v>

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.283
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening infinite times across </v>

11
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.214
<v Speaker 1>infinite realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time the show's teased us with an </v>

12
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>authentic moment of love or motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ripped it right out from Andress.</v>

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.683
<v Speaker 1>My grandpa was my hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I </v>

14
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:39.714
<v Speaker 1>came home without you and your sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you know the real reason I </v>

15
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>rescued you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took over the family.</v>

16
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This leaves an interesting challenge for</v>

17
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>creating a TV show.</v>

18
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you have characters grow when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no meaning?</v>

19
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's show it gives us a novel solution </v>

20
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:52.854
<v Speaker 1>that's a little better than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraling deeper into nihilism </v>

21
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.393
<v Speaker 1>guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die if you touch me and </v>

22
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything just goes black,</v>

23
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.023
<v Speaker 1>don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that growth isn't from the titular </v>

24
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:02.814
<v Speaker 1>protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the matriarch of the Smith family </v>

25
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.963
<v Speaker 1>wasn't list wisecrack quick take on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty and of course spoilers </v>

26
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:10.621
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>so first a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick and morty are called in to help the</v>

28
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>president with some x files,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shenanigans,</v>

29
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but soon for of helping out the leader </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the free world.</v>

30
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Rick and the president began an ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>escalating Dick waving contest,</v>

31
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.273
<v Speaker 1>the to unleash their vast arsenals </v>
<v Speaker 1>against each other before rick has a </v>

32
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>more pressing matter to attend to Jerry </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

33
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>The more interesting subplot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

34
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>is best fresh off the events of episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

35
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.813
<v Speaker 1>Beth begins to question whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had taken rick's offer to be </v>

36
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>replaced by a clone and if she in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the clone to settle the matter.</v>

37
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:43.854
<v Speaker 1>She seeks the help of Jerry who </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreates one of their first dates and </v>

38
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>rekindles their love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still worried she's gone.</v>

39
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Blade runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth,</v>

40
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>runs off to the woods with the family or</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick shows up to kill Jerry and convince</v>

41
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>her that she's not a clone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our last quick take,</v>

42
00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>we talked about rick informing Beth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what her intelligence actually means,</v>

43
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.703
<v Speaker 1>my evil worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're smart when you know nothing </v>

44
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is yours and I've never met</v>

45
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>a universe that was into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick's answer to all this,</v>

46
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we know,</v>

47
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>is don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faced with this,</v>

48
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Beth has given radical freedom to choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>her destiny.</v>

49
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.643
<v Speaker 1>In this freedom brings her solace about </v>
<v Speaker 1>her choice to stay with or leave her </v>

50
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of which choice she makes.</v>

51
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.503
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then stay and luxuriate in a life you </v>

52
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>can finally know you've chosen my secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonuses,</v>

53
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>that no matter what you choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're finally going to chill the Scout.</v>

54
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>But this episode seems to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she chose to stay.</v>

55
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Matthew crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're my daughter.</v>

56
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.693
<v Speaker 1>And as a new found sense of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's being a better mother to summer </v>

57
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put it on for finding now.</v>

58
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

59
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look great.</v>

60
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.333
<v Speaker 1>You're only young ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just promise if the results are too </v>

61
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll use protection.</v>

62
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Finally loves Jerry and has brought her </v>
<v Speaker 1>family back together.</v>

63
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Real family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

64
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>in many ways things will be like season </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

65
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.373
<v Speaker 1>but for some it may seem kind of weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she suddenly rekindled her love </v>

66
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>with the helpless parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Jerry.</v>

67
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.450
<v Speaker 1>We could apply some of the philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 1>themes we've identified in earlier quick</v>

68
00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>takes here like starts bad faith and </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical freedom,</v>

69
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.423
<v Speaker 1>alienation versus agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to propose something a </v>

70
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:15.604
<v Speaker 1>little new to explain why Beth </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconnects with Jerry and her overall </v>

71
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>paradigm shift.</v>

72
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm more Fati the cure for common </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>

73
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.943
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what really made me think of this is </v>

74
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my memory is of hating that night,</v>

75
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.563
<v Speaker 1>but now reliving at all I can feel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how lucky I am to be loved by such a </v>

76
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

77
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>simple man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the woman you married,</v>

78
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Beth worried she's the clone must </v>
<v Speaker 1>now confront and question her past.</v>

79
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Not only is she still thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>rick's original proposition,</v>

80
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.663
<v Speaker 1>the ability to flee her past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a possible clone or those </v>

81
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>memories even her own and what does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean for her future or her happiness are</v>

82
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.253
<v Speaker 1>more fati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a Latin phrase that spreading each </v>

83
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>meister use that means love of fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A more [inaudible] is the affirmation of</v>

84
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>life being what Nietzsche called a yes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sayer.</v>

85
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Not to be confused with the pervasive </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate.</v>

86
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's tied to a thought experiment.</v>

87
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Many refer to as eternal recurrence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplify.</v>

88
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a demon shows up and says he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to groundhog day your whole life.</v>

89
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.303
<v Speaker 1>You get thrown into existential despair </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to infinitely relive </v>

90
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.223
<v Speaker 1>questionable life moments like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity of smash mouth and frosting </v>

91
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:26.810
<v Speaker 1>your tips and middle school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you to paraphrase Nietzsche,</v>

92
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.783
<v Speaker 1>high five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demon and say you've never heard of </v>

93
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:30.214
<v Speaker 1>anything more defined to want to relive </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's happened in your life </v>

94
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>for eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good,</v>

95
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:35.644
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything in between is the </v>

96
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.653
<v Speaker 1>ultimate affirmation of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more foggy and it's part of </v>

97
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche's grand plan to escape the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing nihilism of existence.</v>

98
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Given Beth's existential crisis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity for rick like disillusionment</v>

99
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>causing intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth has to confront her past.</v>

100
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I came to you for help and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting your intelligence and look,</v>

101
00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>we're intelligence gets you and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry,</v>

102
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>she gets to relive a small part of it.</v>

103
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it lips don't sweat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

104
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you may have hated her life the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time around,</v>

105
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 1>including her date with Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time around,</v>

106
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>she'll be that Nietzschean yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving,</v>

107
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think Beth is rewriting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past either.</v>

108
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Just didn't deny the years of misery she</v>
<v Speaker 1>has endured a more Fati isn't about some</v>

109
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is a blessing in disguise,</v>

110
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's more about not to shun the ugly</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of our lives as she tells Jerry,</v>

111
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>she's no longer the woman he married and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure Jerry may be an idiot,</v>

112
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.133
<v Speaker 1>but maybe simplicity is what a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a family history of using </v>

113
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:35.884
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to justify sickness needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see another amore fati moment when </v>

114
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.601
<v Speaker 1>Beth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

115
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Rick has come to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her.</v>

116
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes me related to her,</v>

117
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't relate to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She left her family and me,</v>

118
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>which means I relate to them.</v>

119
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Brushing aside the blade runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remiss of it all.</v>

120
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Beth is also functionally saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a version of Beth have chosen to leave,</v>

121
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.054
<v Speaker 1>but I will embrace being left with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>family rather than dwell on what could </v>

122
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>have been and if you let me extrapolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit.</v>

123
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.173
<v Speaker 1>While there may be infinite universes </v>
<v Speaker 1>where rick and Beth has made infinitely </v>

124
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:11.220
<v Speaker 1>different choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants to stay in this one.</v>

125
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.283
<v Speaker 1>As Nietzsche says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my formula for greatness is a more fati </v>

126
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>that one wants nothing to be different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the future,</v>

127
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>not in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for all eternity.</v>

128
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.373
<v Speaker 1>While meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't necessarily philosophize </v>

129
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.534
<v Speaker 1>about infinite realities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did write about the impossible task </v>

130
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>of knowing oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of excuses to not be who I am.</v>

131
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>So who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

132
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Beth doesn't know who she is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but desperately wants to.</v>

133
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>For Niki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logic of why we actually do anything</v>

134
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>is impenetrable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we want to apply this Nietzschean</v>

135
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.243
<v Speaker 1>framing to rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we the fans almost never know what </v>

136
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>actually drives him.</v>

137
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

138
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you matter so little that I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or maybe it makes you matter.</v>

139
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.473
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while Beth confront about whether or </v>

140
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:56.144
<v Speaker 1>not she chose to be cloned or whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not any of it matters in the infinite </v>

141
00:06:59.061 --> 00:06:59.894
<v Speaker 1>versions of herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche would say it really doesn't </v>

142
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we can do is love our faith and that</v>

143
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>seems to be the choice that Beth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

144
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really interesting because while</v>

145
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>the show is often portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick as a kind of Nietzschean,</v>

146
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Uber Manch at war with the meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos,</v>

147
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>there is no god in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rick and uh,</v>

148
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>quite an uber menschy way doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>create his own new meaning as much as he</v>

149
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>just kind of dicks around in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>self destructive way possible.</v>

150
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Beth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

151
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>when faced with the meaninglessness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos finds happiness,</v>

152
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty Uber Menschy.</v>

153
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>If you asked me now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like me and don't know what to</v>

154
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.744
<v Speaker 1>do with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that you have to wait probably for </v>
