1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 2>a wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did somebody.</v>

3
00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:05.054
<v Speaker 2>Jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here today to talk to you about an </v>

4
00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 2>issue of grave importance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dark stain on our generation,</v>

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.113
<v Speaker 2>the Emoji movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you probably all know most of the </v>

6
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 2>reasons to hate the Emoji movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It served as a family friendly vessel to</v>

7
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 2>cram as many shameless product </v>
<v Speaker 2>placements as 90 minutes can fit.</v>

8
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.193
<v Speaker 2>It's also predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painfully unfunny and tries to convey a </v>

9
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 2>moral message as gracefully as this.</v>

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 2>There's another reason you should hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Emoji movie.</v>

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.903
<v Speaker 2>It's politics and that's because while </v>
<v Speaker 2>it tries to tell a story about </v>

12
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 2>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so poorly thought out.</v>

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 2>That advantage is not only to fail at </v>
<v Speaker 2>being inclusive,</v>

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.173
<v Speaker 2>but accomplishes the exact opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presenting us with a hopeless </v>

15
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.283
<v Speaker 2>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This wise crack addition on the Emoji </v>

17
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what went wrong,</v>

18
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 2>and just in case anyone gives us </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoilers ahead,</v>

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 2>but first a recap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The emoji movie takes place in Tech.</v>

20
00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.134
<v Speaker 2>Stopple is a city of 70 into emojis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inside some kid named Alex his phone </v>

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Emoji decides to stop mooching off his</v>

22
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 2>parents and get a job in boating for his</v>
<v Speaker 2>human overlord problem is he has trouble</v>

23
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 2>maintaining his madness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing a range of emotions instead,</v>

24
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>but since being met is his function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

25
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 2>job up gets labeled a malfunction</v>

26
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>if you have expressions other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>function</v>

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 2>and evades deletion from the text Apolis</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fas,</v>

28
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.523
<v Speaker 2>as the movie drags on his antics </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened to kill him and everyone he </v>

29
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 2>loves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once Alex tires have issues,</v>

30
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>wireless wireless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to make an appointment.</v>

31
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.073
<v Speaker 2>This phone is playing games with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just scape is assisted by princess </v>

32
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>turned hacker and a high five who loves </v>
<v Speaker 2>to dance.</v>

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Alex decides to wipe his broken phone.</v>

34
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to leave everything to it.</v>

35
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Jean witnesses the deaths of all his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

36
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.393
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He manages to malfunction with </v>

37
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.604
<v Speaker 2>confidence and grace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing Alex to properly mack on some </v>

38
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

39
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That's super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emoji.</v>

40
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.013
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex is happy with his broken phone </v>

41
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:05.414
<v Speaker 2>because it's made him a mack daddy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gene gets to express himself however he </v>

42
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:09.254
<v Speaker 2>pleases the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The emoji movie is certainly trying to </v>

43
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:12.674
<v Speaker 2>espouse a noble message that we are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>bound by tradition or birth and can </v>

44
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 2>become whatever we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a new trope.</v>

45
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.473
<v Speaker 2>The nobles overcome their birth name for</v>
<v Speaker 2>her bidden love a warrior who wants to </v>

46
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.584
<v Speaker 2>fight in spite of societal expectations </v>
<v Speaker 2>or pretty much any story where someone </v>

47
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:29.144
<v Speaker 2>packed their bags to escape their small </v>
<v Speaker 2>town existence or the big city </v>

48
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an easy enough concept.</v>

49
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to try really,</v>

50
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:41.201
<v Speaker 2>really hard to botch and with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie botched literally every single</v>

51
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to sell that message so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's worth discussing.</v>

52
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Before we get into the totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

53
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 2>First there's jailbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a princess Emoji by birth,</v>

54
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 2>but she'd rather do cool hacker stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like wearing beanies and watching Mr.</v>

55
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:57.164
<v Speaker 2>robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of doing princess stuff </v>

56
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.473
<v Speaker 2>throughout film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she assists gene and escaping to the </v>

57
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 2>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Innovating deletion.</v>

58
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>She eventually saves the day by throwing</v>
<v Speaker 2>away the hacker costume,</v>

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>reverting to a princess and whistling </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the twitter bird.</v>

60
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can grow up to be anything you want,</v>

61
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.314
<v Speaker 2>but when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to sacrifice who </v>

62
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you are in order to become what society </v>
<v Speaker 2>always expected of you.</v>

63
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>It kind of be like the plot of Milan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if Milan saved the day by going home</v>

64
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:24.994
<v Speaker 2>and cooking her father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice dinner before folding his </v>

65
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.364
<v Speaker 2>laundry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's gene who was born a man </v>

66
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.513
<v Speaker 2>Emoji,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's capable of laughing and </v>

67
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:32.554
<v Speaker 2>screaming and having sweet glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He faces discrimination by not falling </v>

68
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 2>in line with the identity society has </v>
<v Speaker 2>put out for him,</v>

69
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.033
<v Speaker 2>but a conversation between genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parents reveals that his father has the </v>

70
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.084
<v Speaker 2>same malfunction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that gene's malfunction is </v>

71
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 2>gene netic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it.</v>

72
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.273
<v Speaker 2>Jean,</v>

73
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not emojis have</v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA,</v>

74
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 2>the idea that genes whole identity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherited,</v>

75
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 2>further undercuts the message that </v>
<v Speaker 2>society and birth shouldn't dictate what</v>

76
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.384
<v Speaker 2>we aspire to be and because bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions apparently come in threes to </v>

77
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>further cement the message that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>contain some innate,</v>

78
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 2>inescapable nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By birth,</v>

79
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>the high five Emoji reminds us why he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to press buttons.</v>

80
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.283
<v Speaker 2>It's a big red button and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>saves the day by performing the task he </v>

81
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 2>was born to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

82
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:22.564
<v Speaker 2>that's not to say the movie can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to teach people to have </v>

83
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 2>confidence in the things they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>change about themselves,</v>

84
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.223
<v Speaker 2>but it also manages to more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate that you can achieve </v>

85
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>greatness if your genetics allow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also manages to turn Internet trolls,</v>

86
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>who in real life are horrible people by </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own volition into an identity that</v>

87
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>one is born into and therefore can not </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose Emoji.</v>

88
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I thought the conversation just got </v>
<v Speaker 2>dahmer.</v>

89
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.983
<v Speaker 2>Internet trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ignore them so instead we get the </v>

90
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of a racial underclass </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject to constant denigration,</v>

91
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.913
<v Speaker 2>so much for inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if we wanted to concede that </v>

92
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>the emoji movie really was about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable in your identity,</v>

93
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>there's another scarier problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It offers us a vision of the future.</v>

94
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:07.534
<v Speaker 2>That to paraphrase George Orwell's 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>84 is pretty much a boot stamping on an </v>

95
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Emoji face forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On one level,</v>

96
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>the Emoji movie shows us an </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian nightmare.</v>

97
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:17.284
<v Speaker 2>In it's emphatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fewer smiler emojis are put into the </v>

98
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:20.674
<v Speaker 2>service of the messaging APP and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that interferes with the </v>

99
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>functioning of that APP must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminated.</v>

100
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.253
<v Speaker 2>While gene supposedly overthrows this </v>
<v Speaker 2>order by flaunting his God given </v>

101
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.154
<v Speaker 2>talents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we infer really happened to </v>

102
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>text opolis afterwards to figure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

103
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:34.924
<v Speaker 2>we need a little help from German </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher Max Horkheimer Horkheimer </v>

104
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 2>wrote extensively about an idea called </v>
<v Speaker 2>instrumental rationality or instrumental</v>

105
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:42.604
<v Speaker 2>reason and believe that played a crucial</v>
<v Speaker 2>role in the domination of humanity </v>

106
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>throughout the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially into solitary and regimes.</v>

107
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.763
<v Speaker 2>Instrumental rationality is the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason we use to achieve a particular </v>

108
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.633
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I've decided the wise crack team </v>

109
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 2>needs to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 pounds of pizza.</v>

110
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Instrumental reason can help me figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the best,</v>

111
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 2>most efficient way for them to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies with regret.</v>

112
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.573
<v Speaker 2>Drink lots of water the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for the toppings with high water </v>

113
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoke lots of Ganja,</v>

114
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.003
<v Speaker 2>but instrumental rationality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because it doesn't ask bigger </v>

115
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 2>questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I trying to destroy my body?</v>

116
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Or why in God's name did I just spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>$300 on pizza?</v>

117
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.953
<v Speaker 2>And while Horkheimer wasn't talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about pizza or other everyday uses of </v>

118
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.064
<v Speaker 2>practical reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he noted that modern society was fueled </v>

119
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 2>by this flawed kind of rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always figuring out the fastest way to </v>

120
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.414
<v Speaker 2>get somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never trying to figure out if it was </v>

121
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.663
<v Speaker 2>even worth it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texts apolis seems to be run on this </v>

122
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 2>kind of instrumental rationality.</v>

123
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 2>The whole society is organized for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose to deliver Alex the emojis.</v>

124
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 2>He selects here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of us does one thing and we have to</v>

125
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 2>nail it every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are never questions like,</v>

126
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 2>why does Alex get to pick the Emoji?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Hey,</v>

127
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.563
<v Speaker 2>isn't this technically slavery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's good reason if they go on </v>

128
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 2>strike outs will probably uninstalled </v>
<v Speaker 2>the APP and murder them all.</v>

129
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.033
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the problem with </v>

130
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>anthropomorphizing utilities in films </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there are humans present.</v>

131
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 2>It's cute at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you think about it,</v>

132
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:08.534
<v Speaker 2>it gets pretty horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with instrumental </v>

133
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>rationality for Horkheimer is that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>aids in the domination of humanity since</v>

134
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 2>it's concerned with questions like </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiency and usefulness,</v>

135
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 2>both nature and humanity become inputs </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the assembly line of society.</v>

136
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>As we reduced our inner nature to </v>
<v Speaker 2>instrumental functions,</v>

137
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.163
<v Speaker 2>we lose any strong sense of self and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thus lack the inner substance in a </v>

138
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:35.831
<v Speaker 2>manner that makes us metaphorically into</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's and when everyone is reduced to</v>

139
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 2>a use value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things get even scarier.</v>

140
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.703
<v Speaker 2>It's for this reason that Horkheimer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fellow Frankfurt school thinkers </v>

141
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.513
<v Speaker 2>characterize the totalitarianism of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 thirties as the ultimate danger of </v>

142
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 2>the instrumental rationality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pervades our modern world.</v>

143
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 2>We see the totalitarian danger of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in the Emoji movie society is</v>

144
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:55.484
<v Speaker 2>organized based on how individual emojis</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be instrumentalized in the surface </v>

145
00:07:58.791 --> 00:07:59.624
<v Speaker 2>of Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>emojis are used often get to go to the </v>

146
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>cool parties and are popular with peers </v>
<v Speaker 2>while those unused get sent to the loser</v>

147
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:07.094
<v Speaker 2>lounge and those that disturb the peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As with gene get liquidated and while </v>

148
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 2>the existential threat of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>deleted,</v>

149
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>they sound like good rationalization for</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing gene.</v>

150
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 2>It's also worth noting that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian regimes sell their message</v>

151
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>through existential threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the whole,</v>

152
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 2>it's either this or the demise of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German people stick,</v>

153
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 2>so it was gene's victory in the climax </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the film,</v>

154
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 2>a blow against the authoritarian terror </v>
<v Speaker 2>of smiler.</v>

155
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

156
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jean is a revered hero.</v>

157
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:38.551
<v Speaker 2>High five is popular again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the exclusive vip parties of the old</v>

158
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>regime are now open to all from now on.</v>

159
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is all this?</v>

160
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 3>It's for you Jane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

161
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.663
<v Speaker 2>in the after credit scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see smuggler relegated to the loser </v>

162
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:57.521
<v Speaker 2>lounge confirming a sill existing </v>
<v Speaker 2>between usable and unusable emojis,</v>

163
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.973
<v Speaker 2>but for Horkheimer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shouldn't be much of a surprise as </v>

164
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 2>he writes what is usually indicated as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>

165
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.810
<v Speaker 2>The happiness of the individual health </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth gains at significance exclusively</v>

166
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 2>from its functional potentiality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

167
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:12.414
<v Speaker 2>the happiness of everyone in text opolis</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only significant in that Alex is </v>

168
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.404
<v Speaker 2>texting app still works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is solved in regards to the </v>

169
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:21.800
<v Speaker 2>extreme instrumental rationality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>textile pollutes.</v>

170
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Emojis are still instrumentalized for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>

171
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 2>and if gene's malfunction is now </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular,</v>

172
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>it's only by the whims of their human </v>
<v Speaker 2>overlord.</v>

173
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.773
<v Speaker 2>We even get an Emoji dance where emojis </v>
<v Speaker 2>are seemingly free to emote as they </v>

174
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:34.644
<v Speaker 2>pleased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this expressiveness is only </v>

175
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>permissible in so far as it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>threaten Alex's social prowess,</v>

176
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and because the film hints that gene's </v>
<v Speaker 2>malfunction is inherited,</v>

177
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.513
<v Speaker 2>the implication is a new dystopia where </v>
<v Speaker 2>those with a quasi genetic mutation can </v>

178
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 2>better serve Alex.</v>

179
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.250
<v Speaker 2>while those born of lesser genes can </v>
<v Speaker 2>still be discarded.</v>

180
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.263
<v Speaker 2>So while we may have thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of smilers regime would have meant </v>

181
00:09:56.731 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 2>liberation of emotions and text Apolis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that Alex is still the ultimate</v>

182
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 2>judge of functionality means nothing has</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

183
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Emoji still live under the iron fist</v>

184
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.950
<v Speaker 2>of Alex because nothing has been done to</v>
<v Speaker 2>undermine their instrumentalization.</v>

185
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 2>What will become of gene when Alex tires</v>
<v Speaker 2>have is ultimately meaningless?</v>

186
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Emoting one day he may decide to do away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with whatever money,</v>

187
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 2>eyes slash kissing face slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunglasses,</v>

188
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 2>emoji means and go straight for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eggplant Emoji.</v>

189
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 2>As if to foreshadow this high five tells</v>
<v Speaker 2>us early in the film</v>

190
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.363
<v Speaker 4>what you need off fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give you complete an unrelenting </v>

191
00:10:31.721 --> 00:10:34.270
<v Speaker 4>support as long as you're on top.</v>

192
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.383
<v Speaker 2>And here's the issue with making emojis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are things with an actual </v>

193
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:39.764
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a metaphor for humans who are more than </v>

194
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:42.974
<v Speaker 2>a utility on a smartphone APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes a lot more sense to delete and </v>

195
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:46.544
<v Speaker 2>Emoji for not doing its job than </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering a human for not doing its job </v>

196
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.760
<v Speaker 2>in textile apolis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the system truly goes too far,</v>

197
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.683
<v Speaker 2>Alex can just get another phone that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not exactly how human civilization </v>

198
00:10:56.961 --> 00:10:57.794
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here we can see the shift in how </v>

199
00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:02.810
<v Speaker 2>domination happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas 100 years ago,</v>

200
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the system enforced its rules with </v>
<v Speaker 2>repression like smilers,</v>

201
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.883
<v Speaker 2>our modern society strengthen their rule</v>
<v Speaker 2>with liberation or at least liberation </v>

202
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:11.324
<v Speaker 2>within bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As fellow Frankfurt School Herbert </v>

203
00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:16.400
<v Speaker 2>marcuse or wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the freedoms afforded to western</v>

204
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:17.234
<v Speaker 2>civilization only served to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>repression of those societies more </v>

205
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:21.314
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're given the freedom of how to exist </v>

206
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:23.834
<v Speaker 2>within the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never the freedom to escape the </v>

207
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:26.420
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

208
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.980
<v Speaker 2>The Post almost apocalypse world of text</v>
<v Speaker 2>habilis certainly seems more permissive,</v>

209
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>but what has been omitted from the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the possibility of escape.</v>

210
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Jailbreak once resisted the system by </v>
<v Speaker 2>escaping it,</v>

211
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.473
<v Speaker 2>living outside the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now she's back in text apolis in </v>

212
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:42.194
<v Speaker 2>full princess the tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cloud then represents the ultimate </v>

213
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:49.190
<v Speaker 2>resistance to the system which has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>brushed aside by the film and jeans.</v>

214
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Heroics have only served to perpetuate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this cruel system is the ultimate of the</v>

215
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Emoji movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resistance is futile,</v>

216
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 2>were either subjugated by strict </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian regime or we get to express</v>

217
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:00.784
<v Speaker 2>ourselves freely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long as it serves the same master in </v>

218
00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:04.404
<v Speaker 2>either case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom is an illusion and your </v>

219

<v Speaker 5>What we have business to attend to.</v>
