00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Before getting into a negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to set a floor and a</v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>ceiling so you know where to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be manipulated and you can,</v>

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose yourself in the emotions.</v>

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.883
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a good negotiator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will obviously try at least to be </v>

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>completely disconnected emotionally from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal and negotiation itself.</v>

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Although you will play emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are not upset,</v>

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you can play upsets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>but none of that matters unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>unless you don't have a floor and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling.</v>

11
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know if you go under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor,</v>

12
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:38.994
<v Speaker 1>you need to walk out or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the negotiation and at the ceiling </v>

13
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you need to know to accept so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>close the deal.</v>

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Time is very interesting when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to negotiation.</v>

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I always say in real estate at time </v>
<v Speaker 1>kills everything,</v>

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.623
<v Speaker 1>all deals.</v>

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>But this a little bit of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few seconds,</v>

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes a couple of hours depending</v>

19
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>on the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can use and delay to get where</v>

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you want because people get frustrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a certain point and in a good way.</v>

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>If you don't give the information right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

22
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>just hold it back tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny bits and make them wait.</v>

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>That could be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>

24
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>when I go into an apartment and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seller is,</v>

25
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>they're always asking me at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the appointment,</v>

26
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>so Frederick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is my penthouse worth?</v>

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I never ever give a price in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments.</v>

28
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>One because I want to do my research and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really go home and think about it.</v>

29
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to be drawn into any </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>which I could potentially be cause it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so beautiful.</v>

31
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the purpose of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

32
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.883
<v Speaker 1>Having them wait three and a half hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an email to come with a price will </v>

33
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>make them want it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then having it come in writing,</v>

34
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>we'll feel more substantial and real </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's coming in an email.</v>

35
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.734
<v Speaker 1>He had to wait for it.</v>

36
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.973
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
