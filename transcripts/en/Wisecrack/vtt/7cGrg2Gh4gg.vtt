1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Hey wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here.</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Today we're breaking down everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite insomniac,</v>

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>his soap salesman bff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're super,</v>

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>super secret underground club for due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to beat each other senseless.</v>

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.273
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about that thing you're </v>

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.224
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For most fight club is about chiseled </v>

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.374
<v Speaker 1>men who like to knock each other's teeth</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and destroy private property to </v>

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.124
<v Speaker 1>escape the monotony of consumer culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about fight club </v>

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>we often overlook is tyler durden really</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suave savior.</v>

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>We thought he was welcome to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack condition on the philosophy of</v>

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>fight club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.503
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight club begins with our nameless </v>

13
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>protagonist slash narrator as he tries </v>
<v Speaker 1>to beat insomnia and complete his life.</v>

14
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>One Ikea Shelf at a time.</v>

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to order the Eric Carle dust </v>

16
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 2>ruffles</v>

17
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>is doctor suggests he see real pain at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>testicular cancer support group.</v>

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And our narrator finally finds the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleep crying his eyes out.</v>

19
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>But another faker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marla singer ruins it,</v>

20
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>flaunting her lack of balls to are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>again sleepless narrator.</v>

21
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Testicular cancer should be no contest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

22
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.413
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one more right to me though than </v>

23
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still have your balls off,</v>

24
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>gets put on hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the narrator's apartment blows up,</v>

25
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.353
<v Speaker 1>destroying his perfectly manicured </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle and forcing him to live with </v>

26
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>one tyler durden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and tyler share some drinks.</v>

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Go on wild in Xeni Adventures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince lots of people to beat the crap</v>

28
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also domestic terrorism,</v>

29
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:24.924
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most overt theme in Fight Club is </v>

30
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:28.104
<v Speaker 1>the drudgery of consumer capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our narrator lives a tiny life of </v>

31
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:32.574
<v Speaker 1>tedium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working a job he hates throughout the </v>

32
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks half asleep staring,</v>

33
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>absent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindedly into space,</v>

34
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>unable to feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point the narrator tells us</v>

35
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.513
<v Speaker 2>when you have insomnia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never really asleep and you're </v>

36
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 2>never really awake</v>

37
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.673
<v Speaker 1>as he watches an infomercial suggesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's not only half conscious </v>

38
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>because of insomnia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also consumerism,</v>

39
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.393
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly by club shows a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of what sociologists call </v>

40
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.173
<v Speaker 1>rationalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rationalization in this sense isn't </v>

41
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.250
<v Speaker 1>quite using rationality in the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>

42
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but using a certain kind of rationality </v>
<v Speaker 1>to organize society.</v>

43
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Essentially rationalization favors </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency over tradition,</v>

44
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>custom or individual desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

45
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:14.674
<v Speaker 1>instead of getting your pies made with </v>
<v Speaker 1>love from the nice little bigger down </v>

46
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.094
<v Speaker 1>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get them from a factory where </v>

47
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>they're made on a cold dead assembly </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

48
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Modern social life is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by rationalization.</v>

49
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.883
<v Speaker 1>It's organized to accommodate large </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of people in the most efficient </v>

50
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:30.424
<v Speaker 1>way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything in the narrator's life is </v>

51
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:33.154
<v Speaker 1>designed for a specific purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass produced and unrelentingly </v>

52
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>predictable down to his bosses tie.</v>

53
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 2>It must've been Tuesday he was wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this cornflower blue tie,</v>

54
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>even calls his own home,</v>

55
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.253
<v Speaker 2>a condo on the 15th floor of a filing </v>
<v Speaker 2>cabinet for widows and young </v>

56
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 2>professionals describing</v>

57
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.233
<v Speaker 1>his existence as nothing more than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient way to store and organize </v>

58
00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:53.344
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight Club shows us that efficiency has </v>

59
00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:56.134
<v Speaker 1>its downsides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a world where efficient </v>

60
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>means efficiently consuming to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where as Tyler durden says,</v>

61
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 3>things you own end up owning you.</v>

62
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>The narrator describes everything as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a</v>

63
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>copy of a copy of a copy.</v>

64
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Consumer products and consumers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from each other.</v>

65
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.770
<v Speaker 1>The drive this point home director David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fincher,</v>

66
00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>even put a starbucks cup in almost every</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene of the film for philosophers,</v>

67
00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:21.044
<v Speaker 1>Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This trend of indistinguishable </v>

68
00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:27.860
<v Speaker 1>commodities is a direct result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalization according to them.</v>

69
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Everything we're sold comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standardized menu of constructs all </v>

70
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:32.744
<v Speaker 1>designed to be as cost effective as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible while promoting fake </v>

71
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider the Dubé,</v>

72
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 1>which may or may not be different than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comforter.</v>

73
00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to read about it.</v>

74
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Gava</v>

75
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.790
<v Speaker 3>no want a DJ is blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just blank.</v>

76
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Why don't guys like you and I know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the phase this essential to our survival</v>

77
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 3>in the hunter gatherer sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

78
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to consumers,</v>

79
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

80
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.653
<v Speaker 1>Some good marketing might make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things we buy seem different from each </v>

81
00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:06.164
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality they're all pretty much </v>

82
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:10.220
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbies of copies of copies.</v>

83
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.203
<v Speaker 1>This commodification of all things makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>life pretty dull and also kind of </v>

84
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>fascist for Adorno and Horkheimer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the characters in fight club,</v>

85
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>living in a rationalized world can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dehumanizing effect.</v>

86
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Turning everyone into lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alienated drones at the behest of </v>

87
00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:27.740
<v Speaker 1>consumer capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living life,</v>

88
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:28.574
<v Speaker 1>just following orders if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flown around the country on business </v>

89
00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:31.814
<v Speaker 1>trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrator describes the isolation </v>

90
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:35.270
<v Speaker 1>that comes with a single serving </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

91
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Everything is small and disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the people he meets,</v>

92
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.863
<v Speaker 2>it's the people I meet on each flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're single serving friends between </v>

93
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>takeoff and landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have our time together.</v>

94
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.210
<v Speaker 2>That's all we get.</v>

95
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.733
<v Speaker 1>After getting in a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He muses about the dehumanizing effect </v>

96
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>of his own work.</v>

97
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.263
<v Speaker 3>I'd never been in a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This must've been when all those people </v>

98
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 3>felt like before I filed them statistics</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my reports.</v>

99
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.060
<v Speaker 1>So how do we cope with a single serving </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle?</v>

100
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 1>One might be tempted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a hobby,</v>

101
00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:10.220
<v Speaker 1>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for Adorno and Horkheimer amusement,</v>

102
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.083
<v Speaker 1>under modern day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism has just become a </v>

103
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:13.514
<v Speaker 1>prolongation of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbies and entertainment serve to </v>

104
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.890
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenate us so we can go back to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day.</v>

105
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.570
<v Speaker 1>But those same things that keep us sane </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our off hours are still determined by</v>

106
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:26.750
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes amusement the after images of</v>

107
00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>the work process itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

108
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Speaker 1>if we are working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're buying mass produced stuff to help</v>

109
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 1>us feel better about the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go to work again.</v>

110
00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 1>The next day.</v>

111
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.953
<v Speaker 2>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of dining set defines me as a </v>

112
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>person</v>

113
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.893
<v Speaker 1>or we get the fat sucked out of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was caused by our own decadent </v>

114
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

115
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 2>You were selling rich women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own fat asses back to them.</v>

116
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.263
<v Speaker 1>The narrator's way of coping is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>just an extension of living as a </v>

117
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 1>consumer in a rationalized world.</v>

118
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Speaker 3>I had it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had that's there.</v>

119
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 3>That was a very decent wardrobe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was very respectable.</v>

120
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I was close to being complete</v>

121
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.323
<v Speaker 1>during the winter as far as directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing this kind of mass consumption </v>

122
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.293
<v Speaker 1>to fascism for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanism of rationalization that </v>

123
00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:13.230
<v Speaker 1>causes people to blindly throw their </v>
<v Speaker 1>money at big companies like starbucks is</v>

124
00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the same mechanism that causes people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw themselves at Fascist ideology.</v>

125
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.503
<v Speaker 1>Much like the citizens of a fascist </v>
<v Speaker 1>state mobilize under a totalitarian </v>

126
00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:22.134
<v Speaker 1>dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern society has mobilized under </v>

127
00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:24.804
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't until his apartment </v>

128
00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:27.114
<v Speaker 1>mysteriously blows up that the narrator </v>
<v Speaker 1>finds a new way to resist </v>

129
00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:33.450
<v Speaker 1>rationalization after losing all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>precious Ikea furniture.</v>

130
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.690
<v Speaker 1>He trades in elite and capitalism for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in tyler.</v>

131
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:37.524
<v Speaker 1>Durden is crumbling mansion on paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>street paper streets is the exact </v>

132
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 1>opposite of his former apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the other one was small,</v>

133
00:06:43.651 --> 00:06:47.160
<v Speaker 1>efficient and well decorated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paper Street is needlessly large,</v>

134
00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:50.730
<v Speaker 1>disorganized and dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If his apartment was rational,</v>

135
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>paper street is irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his new home,</v>

136
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Speaker 1>he joins tyler durden and his fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against consumer culture.</v>

137
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Tyler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the charming,</v>

138
00:06:58.291 --> 00:06:59.124
<v Speaker 1>charismatic leader of Fight Club </v>
<v Speaker 1>champions a resistance against </v>

139
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:02.484
<v Speaker 1>oppressive consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offering the narrator and escape in a </v>

140
00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:05.694
<v Speaker 1>way to reclaim his identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does escaping rationalization </v>

141
00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>have to do with punching people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face?</v>

142
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Tyler's resistance takes things a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>further than your run of the mill </v>

143
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:14.934
<v Speaker 1>critique of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He frames consumerism as an assault on </v>

144
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:18.564
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The men in fight club basically fear </v>

145
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that society is turning them into women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel degraded by their jobs.</v>

146
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>The narrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this sense is the perfect image of an</v>

147
00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:28.524
<v Speaker 1>emasculated consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's weak and goes to support groups </v>

148
00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>where he hugs people and cries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>girl stuff at the testicular cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>support groups.</v>

150
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have literally become </v>
<v Speaker 1>emasculated.</v>

151
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.233
<v Speaker 1>One of the participants laments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been cuckolded as his wife has had </v>

152
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:43.740
<v Speaker 1>the child they could never have had with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new man.</v>

153
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 3>She had her first child last week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a girl with her new husband.</v>

154
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 1>The film really drives this symbolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>home with the character of Bob.</v>

155
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.793
<v Speaker 1>Once a bodybuilder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bob literally loses his balls to </v>

156
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.580
<v Speaker 1>testicular cancer and gross bitch tits </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of hormone therapy.</v>

157
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 3>There's still men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

158
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Where I'm at man is what we are.</v>

159
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>His loss of masculinity results in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger from his family.</v>

160
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Any fields completely dehumanized?</v>

161
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.640
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Baker up,</v>

162
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 3>divorced my two grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean return?</v>

163
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.124
<v Speaker 3>My phone calls.</v>

164
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.193
<v Speaker 1>The narrator and Tyler also discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>their absentee fathers wondering what </v>

165
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the role of being raised by women has </v>
<v Speaker 1>played in their lives.</v>

166
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 3>We're a generation of men raised by </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

167
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering if another woman is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer.</v>

168
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Speaker 3>We name</v>

169
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.050
<v Speaker 1>and Tyler tells the narrator,</v>

170
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it couldn't be worse.</v>

171
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Woman could cut off your penis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wave sleeping,</v>

172
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 3>toss out the window of a moving car.</v>

173
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.753
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole movie is about losing your </v>

174
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:48.794
<v Speaker 1>balls and or Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given the emasculation of modern </v>

175
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:51.824
<v Speaker 1>consumer society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight Club is appealing because it </v>

176
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:54.434
<v Speaker 1>allows members to express themselves by </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting in a way they can't in everyday </v>

177
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>life being really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really violent,</v>

178
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>which is something they associate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>being men with a capital m.</v>

179
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Masculinity through aggression provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>a way for the men to cope with their </v>

180
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>girly day jobs and domestic consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

181
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.403
<v Speaker 1>But while Tyler durden laments the fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of masculinity sold to us by </v>

182
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sells them another kind of manliness.</v>

183
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 1>The second half of fight club is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how tyler durden has taken all the</v>

184
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.354
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Project mayhem is supposed to rebel </v>

185
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:23.544
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repackaged it and sold it to his </v>

186
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayhem stooges,</v>

187
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the members of fight club just become </v>
<v Speaker 1>copies of copies of each other.</v>

188
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.380
<v Speaker 1>They shaved their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called each other magnet.</v>

189
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.960
<v Speaker 1>They even lose their names in project </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem.</v>

190
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>We have no names rebelling against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that's made them faceless drones.</v>

191
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They become well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faceless drones and rumor,</v>

192
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff about losing your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

193
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>testicles under the reign of tyler </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't fairing much better either.</v>

194
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.523
<v Speaker 1>The movie gives us an early glimpse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's to come as tyler durden just </v>

195
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly punches this guy in the Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>Project.</v>

196
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Mayhem later threatens to cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's balls off</v>

197
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.473
<v Speaker 3>publicly state that there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wunderground or these guys are going to </v>

198
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.090
<v Speaker 3>take your balls.</v>

199
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.183
<v Speaker 1>Even its own founder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said if anyone ever interferes with </v>

200
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.673
<v Speaker 1>project mayhem even you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to get his balls for Bob and the </v>

201
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:12.574
<v Speaker 1>narrator fight club has simply replace </v>
<v Speaker 1>the support groups in their lives and </v>

202
00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:16.594
<v Speaker 1>they chat about their fight club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Days like one might talk about their </v>

203
00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:20.410
<v Speaker 1>weekly support groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schedules</v>

204
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 3>go Tuesdays and Thursdays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go Saturday,</v>

205
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.970
<v Speaker 1>tyler acts like a strong father figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the narrator and the rest of Project</v>

206
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.803
<v Speaker 1>Bay Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will carry you kicking and screaming </v>

207
00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 1>and in the end you will think of me but </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the narrator's he father,</v>

208
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.113
<v Speaker 3>he left when I was like six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this other woman had kids and he </v>

209
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.103
<v Speaker 3>like did this every six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes to a new city and starts a new </v>

210
00:10:42.471 --> 00:10:43.304
<v Speaker 3>family</v>

211
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 1>franchise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pilar abandoned him.</v>

212
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 1>The most devoted members of fight club </v>
<v Speaker 1>are put through intense hazing to become</v>

213
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>members of project mayhem before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can join.</v>

214
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.233
<v Speaker 1>Perspective members have to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the paper street mansion for </v>

215
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 1>three days without food or shelter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her verbally and physically abused.</v>

216
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Those who tough it out are allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the house and Become Part of a </v>

217
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:04.224
<v Speaker 1>well oiled machine that blows up </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer stores to horizons politicians </v>

218
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>and since corporate sculptures rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>into coffee shops.</v>

219
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.883
<v Speaker 1>As Tyler's movement gains momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it transforms from an afterschool </v>

220
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:14.394
<v Speaker 1>activity into a fascist cult that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>just be as bad as the capitalism they </v>

221
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>rebelled against in the first place.</v>

222
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 4>You are not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not beautiful,</v>

223
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 4>no place for the same decaying organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter and everything else.</v>

224
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Time was built himself in army.</v>

225
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 4>We are the all singing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all dancing wrap up the world.</v>

226
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.310
<v Speaker 4>We are all hard to say pop magic</v>

227
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.850
<v Speaker 1>mayhem operates through strict rules and</v>
<v Speaker 1>systematic efficiency.</v>

228
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.953
<v Speaker 1>Even rely on capital to run properly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fund their activities by making and </v>

229
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:52.070
<v Speaker 1>selling soap out of human fat stolen </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a liposuction clinic.</v>

230
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.083
<v Speaker 1>The difference is now instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting to the demands of their </v>

231
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:55.954
<v Speaker 1>corporate bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>members report to their patriarchal </v>

232
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:59.900
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyler durden.</v>

233
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Sooner or later we all became what tyler</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted us to be.</v>

234
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Chapters began springing up all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

235
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.370
<v Speaker 1>The narrator even calls them franchises.</v>

236
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Tyler had been busy setting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>franchises all over the country</v>

237
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.523
<v Speaker 1>the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Project mayhem has been plotting toward </v>

238
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:17.074
<v Speaker 1>a master plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing up the officers of the credit </v>

239
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:19.984
<v Speaker 1>card companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrator discovers this plan and </v>

240
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>also discovers that he and tyler durden </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the same person.</v>

241
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Is that a pretty accurate description?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got relationship tyler.</v>

242
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 2>We have just lost cabin pressure.</v>

243
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Tyler durden was the manly virile </v>
<v Speaker 1>compliment to the narrator's emasculated</v>

244
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:35.534
<v Speaker 1>helplessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we recall when the narrator says </v>

245
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.540
<v Speaker 1>early on that</v>

246
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.030
<v Speaker 2>and suddenly I realized that all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

247
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.470
<v Speaker 2>the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bombs,</v>

248
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 2>the revolution that's got something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with a girl named Marla sings</v>

249
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.880
<v Speaker 1>probably means that his spiral into </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis began when he needed to create</v>

250
00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:52.530
<v Speaker 1>an alter ego to be with her.</v>

251
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.570
<v Speaker 5>You were looking for a way to change </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life.</v>

252
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Speaker 5>Could not do this on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the ways you wish you could be.</v>

253
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.930
<v Speaker 5>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look like you want to look like you want</v>

254
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:05.160
<v Speaker 5>to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm smart,</v>

255
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.690
<v Speaker 5>capable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and most importantly,</v>

256
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm free and all the ways that you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

257
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.920
<v Speaker 1>he's able to get rid of durden by </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting himself in the face,</v>

258
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:12.754
<v Speaker 1>but the damage is already done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The buildings collapsed supposedly to </v>

259
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:16.894
<v Speaker 1>reset societies debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not sure how that actually </v>

260
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like tyler and the narrator are two</v>

261
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>sides of the same person for Adorno and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Horkheimer.</v>

262
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Fascism and capitalism are two sides of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same coin.</v>

263
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.043
<v Speaker 1>They argued that both fascism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism see human beings as numbers </v>

264
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:33.454
<v Speaker 1>instead of individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alienated objects to be used and </v>

265
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think?</v>

266
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.243
<v Speaker 1>What's worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So coming to the lower of Ikea catalogs </v>

267
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.064
<v Speaker 1>and coffee chains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or following the orders of a fascist </v>

268
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 1>soap salesman offering promises of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
