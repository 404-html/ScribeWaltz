1
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

2
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:12.364
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that to the pursuit of shareholder </v>

3
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've lost raison d'etre,</v>

4
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Blair shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Fuqua School of business,</v>

5
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:28.621
<v Speaker 1>Duke University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get your resume dettra right,</v>

6
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not in conflict with making money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.090
<v Speaker 1>it just frames how you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you do it in a way which is,</v>

8
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.353
<v Speaker 1>is more likely to sustain itself over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and more likely to contribute to </v>

9
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:42.764
<v Speaker 1>society and larger sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out you fail fast when </v>

10
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you've lost your resin data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Arthur Anderson,</v>

11
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>right the year before Arthur Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 1>was put out of business.</v>

12
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It was the number one company for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>business schools in the world.</v>

13
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Students wanting to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

14
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.193
<v Speaker 1>Because they made a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really professionally while </v>

15
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a spectacular firm to work for,</v>

16
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but they forgot their resident Natura,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was to ensure fairness,</v>

17
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>honesty in the marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.723
<v Speaker 1>Was to make sure that the numbers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were produced were numbers we could </v>

19
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>believe as soon as they forgot that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed overnight.</v>

20
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Enron failed overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>financial services firms fail overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

22
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Because whole bunch of reasons didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the right risk controls in place.</v>

23
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:31.311
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>they forgot that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their brand matter,</v>

25
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:34.864
<v Speaker 1>they forgot that the franchise manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at one level you could look at it </v>

26
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>and say they forgot the resin data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so all I'm saying when I sort of say</v>

28
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a moral side of business is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's straightforward,</v>

29
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>which is remember why you're in business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and predicate every decision you make on</v>

30
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:54.224
<v Speaker 1>that as well as whether you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money and it turns out if you do </v>

31
00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>those two things together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will sustainably make money.</v>

32
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Forget the one you'll go out of business</v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

33
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:04.724
<v Speaker 1>Forget the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to business because you won't </v>

34
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>have the cash to support the business </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

35
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>What they need to do is fix what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken and invent the future,</v>

36
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as they come out of it,</v>

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.483
<v Speaker 1>the question of what's the mental model </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have for how you manage the </v>

38
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:21.864
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no question that what you need </v>

39
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:30.171
<v Speaker 1>to do is innovate and call at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time always what occurs,</v>

40
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

41
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>as we get wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we forget to call.</v>

42
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And so what has to happen then as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>call in the worst of times,</v>

43
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>which means layoffs because if you call </v>
<v Speaker 1>in good times,</v>

44
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>you can actually repurpose physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant,</v>

45
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:50.784
<v Speaker 1>you can give people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can train people to put them in new </v>

46
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.454
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

47
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>if you do it when you're wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually absorb the consequences</v>

48
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.314
<v Speaker 1>of calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you wait to bed to do your </v>

49
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.424
<v Speaker 1>calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually just gonna devastate </v>

50
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>both yourself as a firm in your employee</v>
<v Speaker 1>base and your customer base.</v>

51
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.573
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the issue is be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined at the same time you're </v>

52
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.594
<v Speaker 1>being creative,</v>

53
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

54
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.463
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if he can be discipline at the same </v>

55
00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:14.904
<v Speaker 1>time you're being creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will prepare yourself for the next </v>

56
00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:21.381
<v Speaker 1>downturn because you'll be trim right </v>
<v Speaker 1>where others won't be.</v>

57
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.463
<v Speaker 1>and you'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll just survive better through a </v>

59
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.114
<v Speaker 1>difficult time.</v>
