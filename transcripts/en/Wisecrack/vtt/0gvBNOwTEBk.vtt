00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.743
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley has been a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual resource to us in putting </v>

2
00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>together I innovation agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.803
<v Speaker 1>our discussions began at Stanford </v>
<v Speaker 1>University and when we put the </v>

4
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:15.304
<v Speaker 1>innovation agenda together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became clear that a energy security </v>

5
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:21.274
<v Speaker 1>was it competitiveness issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only a national security issue </v>

6
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>for our country and an economic issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a competitiveness issue.</v>

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.143
<v Speaker 1>So right from the start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we put the innovation agenda </v>

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.683
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley was there from the start </v>

9
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and on energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

10
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:40.321
<v Speaker 1>the green momentum that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a springing forth from Silicon Valley.</v>

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.793
<v Speaker 1>Is there an important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we're going to succeed with </v>

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>our new green economy and with our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

13
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:47.704
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing climate crisis and energy </v>

14
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to have the marketplace,</v>

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead the way.</v>

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.113
<v Speaker 1>So when we see Silicon Valley with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the invention and ingenuity and </v>

17
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.811
<v Speaker 1>discovery plus all of the venture </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital flowing toward that,</v>

18
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.380
<v Speaker 1>we know that we can be successful.</v>
