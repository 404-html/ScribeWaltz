1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 2>well I was still in my parent's basement</v>
<v Speaker 2>busily making money,</v>

3
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 2>doing our audio visual stuff and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>an older brother at the time who was off</v>

4
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:18.574
<v Speaker 2>in medical school and he's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright guy doing both an md and a phd </v>

5
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:28.611
<v Speaker 2>program and his phd work was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing therapies for pediatric,</v>

6
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neonatal,</v>

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer patients,</v>

8
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.271
<v Speaker 2>babies with leukemia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was developing the drug therapies</v>

9
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 2>for these neonates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're so small,</v>

10
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.204
<v Speaker 2>they weigh a couple of pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no practical equipment out </v>

11
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:49.941
<v Speaker 2>there for him to deliver his therapies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He'd show up in the basement on trips</v>

12
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.294
<v Speaker 2>home from med school and whine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>complain about his lack of equipment </v>

13
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.344
<v Speaker 2>designed for babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't surprising to me that there </v>

14
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.004
<v Speaker 2>isn't a lot of equipment for babies </v>
<v Speaker 2>because fortunately not a very large </v>

15
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 2>piece of the medical population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately old people get sick.</v>

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.883
<v Speaker 2>Babies don't normally have that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could sit in the basement and </v>

17
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.224
<v Speaker 2>imagine that I could build tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny little drug delivery systems </v>

18
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 2>essentially using a syringe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

19
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 2>as a whole day supply of drug instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ivy bottle.</v>

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.833
<v Speaker 2>So I built for my brothers some little </v>
<v Speaker 2>devices that use the syringe as the </v>

21
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:26.454
<v Speaker 2>reservoir and build some electronics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>control systems that would allow him to </v>

22
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 2>program those things for drug delivery </v>
<v Speaker 2>for his research.</v>

23
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.933
<v Speaker 2>I think he was very proud of my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wasn't doing it as a </v>

24
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was helping my brother,</v>

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.363
<v Speaker 2>but he would take it to med schools with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he ended up doing a little time </v>

26
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 2>at Harvard where he met a lot of doctors</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in Boston.</v>

27
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:48.214
<v Speaker 2>Then he ended up doing a residency at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale where he met a lot of the adult </v>

28
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 2>docs and one of these docs at one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

29
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little thing is so small,</v>

30
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 2>it's great that it sits in an isolet </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving around with babies,</v>

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.163
<v Speaker 2>but it's so small you could slap it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the belt or put it in the pocket of an </v>

32
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.274
<v Speaker 2>adult who could walk around getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic therapy for things that might </v>

33
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 2>dramatically improve their healthcare.</v>

34
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about insulin for diabetics?</v>

35
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.873
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly I took this core technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I developed for this very rare </v>

36
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 2>disease that we owe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people will,</v>

37
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 2>will never have to deal with pediatric </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

38
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.343
<v Speaker 2>and it would serve a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very broad population of people walking </v>

39
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>around meeting I insulin to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their diabetes.</v>

40
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And so we modified the pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We moved out of the basement,</v>

41
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>we started making lots of different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.953
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical delivery systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up building an ice company around </v>

43
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

44
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:51.374
<v Speaker 2>and to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we continue to build stuff for home </v>

45
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 2>dialysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes care.</v>

46
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.273
<v Speaker 2>We build lots of products related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping people get both better therapy </v>

47
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>and live better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live simultaneous.</v>
