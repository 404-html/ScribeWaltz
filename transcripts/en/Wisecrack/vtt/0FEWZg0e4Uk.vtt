00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Pick somebody in your life and you send </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a message asking them how their day</v>

2
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:13.501
<v Speaker 1>is going on a scale of one to 10 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that you ask them on</v>

3
00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>a scale of one to 10 for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually get more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer because usually,</v>

5
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you know if somebody says a three or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>they'll explain it a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly you're getting a little more in</v>

7
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:28.164
<v Speaker 1>depth information than you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally get if you had just asked them </v>

8
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

9
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine,</v>

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>or I'm tired or I'm hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you do get a reply,</v>

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you immediately texts </v>
<v Speaker 1>back or write back and say,</v>

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>is there anything I can do to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>number plus one?</v>

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.283
<v Speaker 1>Anything I could do to move you from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to a four or from an eight to a </v>

14
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:50.984
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

15
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.143
<v Speaker 1>And that shows that you are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to take some time and effort to </v>

16
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>little favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little boost for your friend.</v>

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.433
<v Speaker 1>We know in looking at video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is one of the reasons why video </v>

19
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 1>games are such effective relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>management tools,</v>

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>specifically social games like Farmville</v>
<v Speaker 1>or candy crush saga.</v>

21
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Lots of research has shown that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>play these games regularly with people,</v>

22
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>you become more likely to talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about non game topics.</v>

23
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.753
<v Speaker 1>You do that more frequently and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>also more likely to ask them for help </v>

24
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>with a real life problem or more willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to offer them help and the reason why is</v>

25
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.154
<v Speaker 1>the design of the Games supports more </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequent interactions which are really </v>

26
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.204
<v Speaker 1>important for building up that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and also to show </v>

27
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:40.924
<v Speaker 1>reciprocity where you are asking someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>for help or you are offering help and </v>

28
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:47.434
<v Speaker 1>you think about a game like farmville </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can go water some of these </v>

29
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.360
<v Speaker 1>crops or feed their chickens for them.</v>

30
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.193
<v Speaker 1>Or Candy Crush Saga where I'm constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking my inlaws to send me extra lives </v>

31
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sending them little power booths</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the game.</v>

32
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.250
<v Speaker 1>That little act of reciprocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to help you.</v>

33
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to help me and doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly.</v>

34
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:06.514
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday or a couple times a week that </v>

35
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.244
<v Speaker 1>firmly cements in somebody's mind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of you as an ally and you might </v>

36
00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>have people that you want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of you that way,</v>

37
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>that aren't playing any of these video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

38
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:19.564
<v Speaker 1>So the plus one technique is a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you're talking regularly </v>

39
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:25.954
<v Speaker 1>about these everyday topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that you have a chance to give </v>

40
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of support or help just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I move you just plus one on this</v>

42
00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:34.174
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something small that I can do today and </v>

43
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I do quite often </v>
<v Speaker 1>that not only does it help,</v>

44
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make someone else's Day,</v>

45
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:42.904
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of enjoyed it when I get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to hear how people are doing and </v>

46
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>just do that one little thing to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>their day better.</v>

47
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Parents love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents will love it.</v>

48
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

49
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.600
<v Speaker 1>that's like the most prime audience for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

50
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 1>They will write you back a paragraph on </v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's an eight day and then,</v>

51
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>and then you offered you plus one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their dislike.</v>

52
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It's already plentiful on because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>
