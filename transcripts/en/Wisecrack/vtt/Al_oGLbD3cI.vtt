<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack.</v>

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you following ourself,</v>

<v Speaker 1>respect or authortalk.</v>

7
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been reflecting on how this season</v>

8
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:17.144
<v Speaker 1>is focused more on people's reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our modern cultural cluster rather than </v>

9
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the actual events themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:23.654
<v Speaker 1>this week the show commented on people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to something very close to our </v>

11
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park itself.</v>

12
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.163
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel old saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many of you may not remember a </v>

13
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>little movie called South Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

14
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:35.384
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uncut because it's almost 20 years </v>

15
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode artfully echoes the movie,</v>

16
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but this time things are a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

17
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Is southpark showing signs of a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis?</v>

18
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out for those of you who </v>

19
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>aren't caught up on this season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kyle falls for carbons,</v>

20
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:50.384
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi.</v>

21
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>But after a brief flirtation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi cakes,</v>

22
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>kyle to the curb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>returns to Cartman sweaty,</v>

23
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>stubby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>armed embrace,</v>

24
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it starts to match her bloated bow right</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to his trademark.</v>

25
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Assholery Jag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a special needs science fair.</v>

26
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.193
<v Speaker 1>No thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start the discussion with Heidi </v>

27
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:06.554
<v Speaker 1>and Hartman brawling in the hallway </v>
<v Speaker 1>while goes to break up the fight and of </v>

28
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>course everyone hates that he ruined the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

29
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.471
<v Speaker 2>Shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kai.</v>

30
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 2>You sound like your mom.</v>

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>From that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kyle is the butt of a thousand jokes and</v>

32
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's figured out what's caused</v>

33
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>such a culture of meanness at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His former favorite show,</v>

34
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.463
<v Speaker 1>terrence and fill up those two Canadians</v>
<v Speaker 1>have kept on farting into old age and </v>

35
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>have even tooted their way into a brand </v>
<v Speaker 1>new netflix original series.</v>

36
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.213
<v Speaker 1>The new show is a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kyle hates it because having been a </v>

37
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.054
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically farted on in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds himself sympathizing with the </v>

38
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>people getting farted on in the show for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time.</v>

39
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:44.534
<v Speaker 1>I feel kind of bad for the person being </v>
<v Speaker 1>farted on rather than letting those </v>

40
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>loose bowel loonies continue poisoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hearts and minds of children.</v>

41
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.643
<v Speaker 1>Heile takes a stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're organizes an activist group </v>

42
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:54.614
<v Speaker 1>called millennials against Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His protest leads him to shutting down </v>

43
00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the show and eventually it goes all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to the president.</v>

44
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.423
<v Speaker 1>Garrison tells kyle to stop the protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he won't and kyle eventually gets </v>

45
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:05.804
<v Speaker 1>garrison literally turned on drew's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little chubb by the idea of </v>

46
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Nuking Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with that plot.</v>

47
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Sounds familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

48
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>You like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have watched a lot of south park.</v>

49
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Turns out those jokes about kyle being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like his mom were just empty insults.</v>

50
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Kyle's protest mirrors the behavior of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother in south park bigger,</v>

51
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:24.794
<v Speaker 1>long for an uncut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as Sheila created mothers against </v>

52
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Candida to protest the obscenity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrance and Philip movie.</v>

53
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.123
<v Speaker 1>Hile has created millennials against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada to protest terrence and Phillips </v>

54
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:34.754
<v Speaker 1>and new Netflix show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parallels are more than just </v>

55
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>conceptual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lift entire scenes from the movie.</v>

56
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.723
<v Speaker 2>We can't believe that a movie was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>foul language would piss you off summer </v>

57
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I finish?</v>

58
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's how you know.</v>

59
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.443
<v Speaker 2>How can I bet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you were all waste on it </v>

60
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

61
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Can I finish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

62
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I finished</v>

63
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>on one level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is south way of playfully comparing</v>

64
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.444
<v Speaker 1>millennial hostility toward offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>media to the parents of the 90s who </v>

65
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>blamed issues like drug use and </v>
<v Speaker 1>columbine on everything from heavy metal</v>

66
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:09.244
<v Speaker 1>to south park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something else going on </v>

67
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.484
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The South Park movie features a movie </v>

68
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>within a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists and Philip asses a fire.</v>

69
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It was a metal stand in for the South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Park movie itself.</v>

70
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.703
<v Speaker 1>Just as Kyle and company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're witnessing a cruder r rated </v>

71
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:27.931
<v Speaker 1>version of an already obscene TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We the audience were similarly consuming</v>

72
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.304
<v Speaker 1>a cruder r rated version of an already </v>
<v Speaker 1>obscene TV show while parents were </v>

73
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:37.774
<v Speaker 1>protesting southpark in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents in the movie protested terrence </v>

74
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:41.764
<v Speaker 1>and Philip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Canadian duo has always been a riff </v>

75
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:44.554
<v Speaker 1>on how people who've never watched south</v>
<v Speaker 1>park characterize the show is nothing </v>

76
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.214
<v Speaker 1>but Barton poop jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thinking is South Park is far from </v>

77
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:51.814
<v Speaker 1>terrance and fill up these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park has gotten increasingly </v>

78
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>topical and specific over the years with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the occasional returned to their roots.</v>

79
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>add big hairy baths.</v>

80
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Do My shopping list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

81
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I've added big hairy balls to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shopping list.</v>

82
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>That means that old tariffs and Philip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite sharing initials with South Park</v>

83
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.793
<v Speaker 1>Creator Trey Parker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't a perfect parallel to the show </v>

84
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that both shows are objects</v>

85
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>of both love and scorn in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>respective universes holds up.</v>

86
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>So with carrots and Philip acids have </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

87
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:22.414
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Trey were asking us to go along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them as they wonder about their </v>

88
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>place in the cultural landscape where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they to blame back then,</v>

89
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>their answer was a resounding no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

90
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>in the turbulent times of 2017 they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it again,</v>

91
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.673
<v Speaker 1>but this time the answer up to whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not they're implicated in society's </v>

92
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.364
<v Speaker 1>ills is not so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once Kyle realizes that the person </v>

93
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>getting farted on has feelings too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds the show cruel and offensive.</v>

94
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.883
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle's growing distance from terrance </v>

95
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:50.034
<v Speaker 1>and Philip is a commentary on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials new found awareness has </v>

96
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>rendered old school south park humor no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer relevant,</v>

97
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>which leaves Matt and Trey Feeling as </v>
<v Speaker 1>old as terrorists and Philip look,</v>

98
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.723
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the beginning of the show's </v>

99
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.584
<v Speaker 1>attempt at self evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heile takes his concern to the new vice </v>

100
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong woman.</v>

101
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.493
<v Speaker 3>There's a culture at the school and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't break his meanness and I believe </v>

102
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 3>now it comes from a Canadian TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the boys watch it.</v>

103
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.363
<v Speaker 3>I did too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all laugh while they fart innocent </v>

104
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 3>people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>

105
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 3>I never felt for the person being farted</v>
<v Speaker 3>on until now.</v>

106
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 1>There's no shortage of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces that suggests that south park may</v>

107
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:32.030
<v Speaker 1>have fostered this culture of meanness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but strong woman disagrees.</v>

108
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 2>You want to blame farts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems kind of ridiculous,</v>

109
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:39.590
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

110
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.453
<v Speaker 2>it's a slippery slope when we start </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing the finger for our own </v>

111
00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:43.034
<v Speaker 2>shortcomings.</v>

112
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.943
<v Speaker 1>She's making a very salient point here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that we can dig deeper into by </v>

113
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:48.090
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning to bigger,</v>

114
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>longer and uncut as the war with Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>rages.</v>

115
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Kyle runs into his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says it was all for him,</v>

116
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but kyle doesn't see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

117
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing very important</v>

118
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you never took the time to talk to </v>

119
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I get in trouble,</v>

120
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.820
<v Speaker 3>you'll go up and blame everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm the one to blame here with me.</v>

121
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.833
<v Speaker 1>Sheila has started an entire wars that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she could avoid confronting the fact </v>

122
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:11.374
<v Speaker 1>that she was simply a bad parent who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't pay attention to what her child </v>

123
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.730
<v Speaker 1>needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like his mom.</v>

124
00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Kyle brings about horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because of his principles,</v>

125
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but because of his self absorbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>

126
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 3>What do you like what I want to world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've mapped,</v>

127
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:26.204
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't come at someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expense where people can live freely </v>

128
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 3>without fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think farted on.</v>

129
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.433
<v Speaker 3>I want a world we want ridiculed for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Teigen out a world where nice girl that </v>

130
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I liked is it turned into another Eric,</v>

131
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you're kyle admits the real reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his actions,</v>

132
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.843
<v Speaker 1>the shortcomings he was trying to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if Sheila was protesting the terrans </v>

133
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Speaker 1>and Philip movie to cover her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>failings as a parent,</v>

134
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.163
<v Speaker 1>and Kyle is doing it to hide his </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of having lost Heidi to </v>

135
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Cartman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that say about South Park?</v>

136
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>The show since kyle is so often the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice of the show,</v>

137
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did shamelessness get to this?</v>

138
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.283
<v Speaker 3>Did it start with that people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>scooters or did the bar get lowered way </v>

139
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 3>before that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started thinking maybe it was</v>

140
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

141
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.473
<v Speaker 3>but maybe somehow we lower the bar a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago and now we're all sitting </v>

142
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 3>here in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of it all.</v>

143
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.973
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe kyle sadness at losing Heidi who </v>

144
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:27.474
<v Speaker 1>has basically turned into a female </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of cartman antisemitism in all </v>

145
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.360
<v Speaker 1>mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and trey sadness at creating a show</v>

146
00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:34.194
<v Speaker 1>that may have spawned a few real life </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartman's they've always prided </v>

147
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:39.840
<v Speaker 1>themselves on making fun of everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally,</v>

148
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.823
<v Speaker 1>but now do they just come off like out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of touch old people farting on </v>

149
00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:44.574
<v Speaker 1>minorities?</v>

150
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.013
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Now just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love South Park and hate censorship.</v>

152
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Put this critical look in the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>also reflects the show's identity crisis</v>

153
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.180
<v Speaker 1>after a failed attempt at full on </v>
<v Speaker 1>satirical serialization.</v>

154
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.320
<v Speaker 1>We're now in the midst of a season full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ups and downs and a mix of tones.</v>

155
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.273
<v Speaker 1>The episodes range from terrance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philip's style fart jokes to failed </v>

156
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:09.904
<v Speaker 1>political satires two successful ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and episodes that don't make a lot of </v>

157
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.850
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should they be a political show?</v>

158
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.803
<v Speaker 1>Don't even want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can he still be funny if people are now </v>

159
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:21.670
<v Speaker 1>concerned that people are farting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>half feelings,</v>

160
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.230
<v Speaker 1>are we truly in a post funny era of </v>
<v Speaker 1>satire knowing that Matt and Trey find a</v>

161
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 1>lot of 2017 to be miserable just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us.</v>

162
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.333
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that unlike bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer and uncut they aren't giving </v>

163
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:36.220
<v Speaker 1>themselves a free pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know how that evaluation is</v>

164
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:37.054
<v Speaker 1>going to play out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the episode ends on a real </v>

165
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 1>cliffhanger.</v>

166
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 1>What comes after the bombs land on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada?</v>

167
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll just have to twiddle our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers until the season finale.</v>

168
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.810
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the show is getting Maudlin</v>

169
00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:53.050
<v Speaker 1>in its old age looking back on its past </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bleary-eyed former football state</v>

170
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>champion or do Matt and Trey just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>give it?</v>

171
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're overthinking it either way.</v>
