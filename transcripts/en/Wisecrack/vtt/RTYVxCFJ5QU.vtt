<v Speaker 1>a wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.993
<v Speaker 1>Jack is back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means it's time to saddle up and </v>

4
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>head back to the strange and depressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of Hollywood.</v>

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.393
<v Speaker 1>Now we've already talked about Frodo </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and distraction in previous </v>

6
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:18.934
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this season really dives deep into </v>

7
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>an idea that's always been present in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>that idea loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's comfortable with it,</v>

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.183
<v Speaker 1>who's uncomfortable with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who takes 100 painkillers a day to </v>

10
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>avoid it at all costs through its </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensemble of dysfunctional relationships.</v>

11
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Bojack gives us a fresh and quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuanced perspective on loneliness,</v>

12
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.603
<v Speaker 1>not often seen on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can loneliness be healthy or even </v>

13
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.304
<v Speaker 1>let's find out in this wisecrack quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on bojack horseman season five and </v>

15
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.860
<v Speaker 1>of course spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but real quick,</v>

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>a shadow tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new channels sponsor wicks.</v>

17
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.123
<v Speaker 1>We're building a new website using wix </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'll have a bunch of fun and </v>

18
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:56.974
<v Speaker 1>interactive features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a way for you to vote on what </v>

19
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>we should cover in an upcoming episode.</v>

20
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So more on that at the end of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>

21
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 1>back to bojack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first guys,</v>

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.033
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This season revolves around the </v>

23
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>production of bojack's new TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filbert,</v>

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>where bojack navigates a semi </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his Costar,</v>

25
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Gina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

26
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Princess Carolyn attempts to adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

27
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Todd manages his career as a VP at what </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is it right now,</v>

28
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:21.184
<v Speaker 1>dot com and Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter and Diane finalized their </v>

29
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>divorce in an attempt to move on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives as early as the first line.</v>

30
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Willingness is established as a central </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme of the season.</v>

31
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Nothing lonelier than a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good thing.</v>

32
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't need anyone or I might feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>lonesome and as we'll see,</v>

33
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>every major character struggles with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in their own way.</v>

34
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the most obvious one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>

35
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.583
<v Speaker 1>who is struggling to reconcile her </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity as a newly divorced single </v>

36
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:47.794
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen in previous seasons how hard </v>

37
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 1>she used to try to keep up with Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter's expectation speed.</v>

38
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>A fun party goer like him having to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself in relation to him for so long,</v>

39
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.313
<v Speaker 1>only made her focus on her supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings as an introvert while </v>

40
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>abandoning other aspects of herself that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she actually liked.</v>

41
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.393
<v Speaker 2>This is all the stuff that cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 something Diane had to put away when </v>

42
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 2>she moved in with old man peanut butter.</v>

43
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.433
<v Speaker 1>In episode two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we follow her non sequentially across a </v>

44
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 1>timeline that starts with her hitting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack.</v>

45
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 2>You could totally make out right now</v>

46
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.993
<v Speaker 1>during a moment of lonely desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after finding out that Mr peanut </v>

47
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>butter has a new girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she flees to Vietnam for a solo trip.</v>

48
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Once there she's rendered doubly alone </v>
<v Speaker 1>by her inability to speak Vietnamese and</v>

49
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>her fellow Americans assumptions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't speak English.</v>

50
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>You Viet Nam.</v>

51
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>No me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

52
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>She copes with her loneliness in various</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

53
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.103
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in a mega brief romance with a </v>

54
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:42.104
<v Speaker 1>grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every interaction puts Diane Moore </v>

55
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Ilities from a conversation with todd </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something.</v>

56
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to go to the roller rink </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

57
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully there won't be any mob bosses </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

58
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>What am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so random to the grips.</v>

59
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.344
<v Speaker 1>Endless pontification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane realizes often interacting with </v>

60
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>the outside world only leaves her </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling more alone.</v>

61
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>She eventually comes to terms with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic aloneness,</v>

62
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.893
<v Speaker 1>apologizing to bojack for her mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages and admitting that I just </v>

63
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>really need a friend right now over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of the season,</v>

64
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.864
<v Speaker 1>she seems increasingly self actualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>from being able to comfort her romantic </v>

65
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>semi rival pickles to performing a solo </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention for bojack.</v>

66
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.413
<v Speaker 1>Now more on that later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally she's able to exist more </v>

67
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.444
<v Speaker 1>truthfully now that she's not dating </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who doesn't align with our </v>

68
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even her therapist admits that</v>

69
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.340
<v Speaker 3>sounds like our time together is done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What fact that you're setting a boundary</v>

70
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.183
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go forth with the tools that I've given </v>

71
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

72
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.003
<v Speaker 1>through Diane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that self sufficiency and </v>

73
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>embracing solitude can be key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing the truest,</v>

74
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>strongest version of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

75
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:47.854
<v Speaker 1>while Diane is able to be happily alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other characters attempt to make </v>

76
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>relationships work in order to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting loneliness.</v>

77
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.633
<v Speaker 1>Just as Diane's relationship with Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter makes her obsess over her </v>

78
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>fun quotient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Todd's relationship seemed to only bring</v>

79
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>out his two shortcomings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

80
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:03.754
<v Speaker 1>in his relationship with Yolanda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>todd is hurt by the hyperfocused on his </v>

81
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>lack of life direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you tell her</v>

82
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 3>family?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to college.</v>

83
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

84
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess I just wanted you to seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive.</v>

85
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately he decides to end the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

86
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Yolanda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to break up.</v>

87
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.423
<v Speaker 1>Second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so eager to make things work with </v>

88
00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:21.794
<v Speaker 1>emily that he constructs a sex robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he is convinced could compensate </v>

89
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:26.384
<v Speaker 1>for his disinterest in sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While emily isn't super into boning the </v>

90
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:30.194
<v Speaker 1>sex robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big wigs at what time is it right </v>

91
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:32.474
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com are impressed by its Moxie and </v>

92
00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:35.414
<v Speaker 1>the robot is ultimately promoted to CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Todd ultimately destroys the sexual </v>

93
00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Speaker 1>robot and takes off his executive suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thereby eliminating the parts of himself</v>

94
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>that we're trying to please Yolanda and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emily.</v>

95
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.270
<v Speaker 1>As with Diane Todd's interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show how some romantic relationships can</v>

96
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.104
<v Speaker 1>leave you feeling more alone and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now for Princess Carolyn in episode </v>

97
00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:56.594
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get some deeper insights into her </v>

98
00:04:57.711 --> 00:04:58.544
<v Speaker 1>past learning how she went from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>the helps knocked up daughter at the </v>

99
00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:02.084
<v Speaker 1>mercy of her boyfriend's answering </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine tape dynasty only to miscarry </v>

100
00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:09.410
<v Speaker 1>and find herself on her own instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mourning the life she lost.</v>

101
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.423
<v Speaker 1>She created an entirely new one for </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself by moving to La and clawing her </v>

102
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:14.984
<v Speaker 1>way up the Hollywood ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth noting that her latest </v>

103
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:21.230
<v Speaker 1>journey and selfsufficiency also came </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a miscarriage,</v>

104
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.720
<v Speaker 1>the one that blew up her relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Milton.</v>

105
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see Princess Carolyn land on her feet</v>

106
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.883
<v Speaker 1>and channel the same bravery as her </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenage self and starting over after a </v>

107
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 1>difficult loss while sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital waiting to meet her maybe baby.</v>

108
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.363
<v Speaker 1>She admits to Milton that fourth season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess Carolyn did want him to stick </v>

109
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 1>around the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kicked him out.</v>

110
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I wish you'd stayed with me that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you told me to leave?</v>

111
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I guess the lesson is don't listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

112
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:48.804
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

113
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.993
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later she clearly tells him to leave </v>

114
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 1>saying that she doesn't want to raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby with him,</v>

115
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and this time she means it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's what?</v>

116
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:59.730
<v Speaker 1>She wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self sufficiency.</v>

117
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolyn's joke about her baby's name,</v>

118
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>untitled Princess Carolyn project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just that as with her previous career</v>

119
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:07.544
<v Speaker 1>successes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess Carolyn will manage single </v>

120
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>motherhood just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

121
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
<v Speaker 1>so Diane Todd and Princess Carolyn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>journeys through season five illustrate </v>

122
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>various takes on that double edge sword </v>
<v Speaker 1>of loneliness and self sufficiency,</v>

123
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter,</v>

124
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.363
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter also fits this narrative </v>

125
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>because as the character most in need of</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

126
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.590
<v Speaker 1>he's also the least inclined to self </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflections.</v>

127
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not tough enough.</v>

128
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.480
<v Speaker 4>I'll show them how tough I can be.</v>

129
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll be back with more of the red </v>
<v Speaker 1>carpet pre show fashion stravaganza.</v>

130
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the other characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

131
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter rarely appears to want </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything beyond fame,</v>

132
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.303
<v Speaker 1>fun and parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems physically incapable of being </v>

133
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:50.594
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting with the first half his age dog </v>

134
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>lady he meets after signing his divorce </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers as a serial monogamist.</v>

135
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.880
<v Speaker 1>He made desperately hide from loneliness</v>
<v Speaker 1>or self reflection,</v>

136
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>seeking solace in relationships the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way he seek solace in loud parties.</v>

137
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>In the Halloween episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

138
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.663
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter gets dangerously close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>introspection as he wonders how each of </v>

139
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>his wives became bitter and unhappy by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of their relationship.</v>

140
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>What's the common denominator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane offers some insights.</v>

141
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.810
<v Speaker 4>You keep dating women in their twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do do that are not fully formed yet.</v>

142
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Life changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People know about me.</v>

143
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 1>The women he marries eventually grow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>while Mr.</v>

144
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter remains the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that in constantly dating women</v>

145
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 1>who are younger than him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

146
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.263
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter has carved out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient emotional niche he can </v>

147
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 1>continue to occupy as he replaces each </v>
<v Speaker 1>consecutive life with a younger,</v>

148
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.123
<v Speaker 1>more fun version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This safe paint by numbers approach to </v>

149
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:45.634
<v Speaker 1>marriage has kept Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter happy but prevented him </v>

150
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>from maturing in any meaningful way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

151
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:51.664
<v Speaker 1>Mr peanut butter reveals himself to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly pathological in his need to be </v>

152
00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:55.204
<v Speaker 1>coupled up when instead of telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickles the truth about his infidelity </v>

153
00:07:58.031 --> 00:07:58.864
<v Speaker 1>and risking losing her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decides to put a radio and finally </v>

154
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:05.500
<v Speaker 1>our boy bojack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Mr peanut butter may be needy,</v>

155
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.440
<v Speaker 1>at least he's totally upfront about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack.</v>

156
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:09.274
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a more complex and more painful </v>

157
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:12.514
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the outside world from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holly Hawk in the middle of the </v>

158
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>night to inform her that he liked her on</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>

159
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.930
<v Speaker 4>Let you know that I started your </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram photo</v>

160
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.160
<v Speaker 1>to pretending to match Gina's blahzay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take on the relationship.</v>

161
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.900
<v Speaker 1>We work together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make six together.</v>

162
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:29.290
<v Speaker 1>We don't talk about her feelings and yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I've been grudging respect can</v>

163
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:30.124
<v Speaker 1>blossom into blossoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into nothing is when I was going to say </v>

164
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you go bojack's need for human slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

165
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Companionship is palpable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pojoaque has gone the Mr.</v>

166
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter route in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting with women to avoid solitude,</v>

167
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 1>a a toxic pattern that peaked with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nears seduction of his ex girlfriends,</v>

168
00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:46.924
<v Speaker 1>teenage daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This season piece kind of dating these </v>

169
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 1>supremely Jaden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gina,</v>

170
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't appear to need anything from</v>
<v Speaker 1>him emotionally.</v>

171
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I love</v>

172
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 4>being alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish were alone right now,</v>

173
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.650
<v Speaker 4>leaving him</v>

174
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.120
<v Speaker 1>just as lonely as before so he decides </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bypass the whole learning to be alone</v>

175
00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:03.850
<v Speaker 1>with your thoughts thing by altering his</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of being,</v>

176
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.893
<v Speaker 1>enter painkillers writer Johann Hari </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a compelling case for considering </v>

177
00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:11.350
<v Speaker 1>drug addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a disease of bonding.</v>

178
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.423
<v Speaker 1>Humans have an innate primal need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bond and when they're unable to bond </v>

179
00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:16.114
<v Speaker 1>with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll bond with a negative behavior </v>

180
00:09:18.131 --> 00:09:20.350
<v Speaker 1>like smoking or gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

181
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:21.184
<v Speaker 1>he argues that substance use is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substitute for meaningful human </v>

182
00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:24.784
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while researchers are also studying </v>

183
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>how other social and economic factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>can influence addiction in the fictional</v>

184
00:09:30.731 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>world of bojack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loneliness seems like a closely,</v>

185
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Find Solace and drugs even as the </v>

186
00:09:36.731 --> 00:09:37.564
<v Speaker 1>embed him deeper into a fantasy world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly cutting him off from the </v>

187
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:41.674
<v Speaker 1>people around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He begins to see friends and loved ones </v>

188
00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:44.584
<v Speaker 1>as tools for getting what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gina is a tool for helping him sees the </v>

189
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.003
<v Speaker 1>limelight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hollyhock is a tool for helping him </v>

190
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.290
<v Speaker 1>steal his pills back from Gina's </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine cabinet.</v>

191
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Our sense of Bojack's loneliness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented by the Filbert TV show.</v>

192
00:09:57.161 --> 00:09:57.994
<v Speaker 1>Narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert is a hard boiled loaner </v>

193
00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:02.830
<v Speaker 1>detective with a penchant for secrets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and grizzly voiceover.</v>

194
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.610
<v Speaker 4>Why do you still use a landline?</v>

195
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 1>What am I supposed to tell her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just an old fashioned guy,</v>

196
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.880
<v Speaker 1>or maybe I like things that are plugged </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the wall.</v>

197
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.783
<v Speaker 1>Something to grab onto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I start floating away from the </v>

198
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>opening lines of the series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack tries to imply that he relates to</v>

199
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the character as a fellow loaner slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sinek.</v>

200
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.160
<v Speaker 1>This develops into an ongoing joke about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the similarities between the two.</v>

201
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>The set of the show looks exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack's house and boat,</v>

202
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.430
<v Speaker 1>constantly wearing his silver costume </v>
<v Speaker 1>offset.</v>

203
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a costume I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just finished filming a show.</v>

204
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.813
<v Speaker 1>Normally people return the costume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also bojack frequently reach too deeply </v>

205
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:39.460
<v Speaker 1>into his characters narrative despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminders that it's not about you,</v>

206
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filbert.</v>

207
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.760
<v Speaker 1>By the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's become so dissociated,</v>

208
00:10:43.761 --> 00:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>he's completely lost himself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

209
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.233
<v Speaker 1>even the character filbert loses track </v>
<v Speaker 1>of where he begins and ends inventing a </v>

210
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:53.960
<v Speaker 1>make believe partner who he blamed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife's murder.</v>

211
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Rather than taking responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

212
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.420
<v Speaker 4>there's no record of you ever having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>partner at all.</v>

213
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.890
<v Speaker 1>You say you killed your wife and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chief and the coroner and the others.</v>

214
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.503
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack loses any distinction between </v>

215
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 1>himself and Filbert also because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't cope with the horrible things he's</v>

216
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result of this disassociation bojack</v>

217
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.440
<v Speaker 1>pretty much retreats into a fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where he does crazy like choke.</v>

218
00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Gina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>

219
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:22.614
<v Speaker 1>he comes face to face with the bloated </v>
<v Speaker 1>balloon version of himself as if to </v>

220
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:26.424
<v Speaker 1>illustrate the fact that his inability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to face himself is ultimately to blame </v>

221
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:31.164
<v Speaker 1>for all of his problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In an interesting moment in the season </v>

222
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:34.524
<v Speaker 1>finale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bojack begs diane to write one of her </v>

223
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:37.254
<v Speaker 1>Internet takedowns of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants everyone to know about his </v>

224
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 1>worst behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be despised,</v>

225
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 1>chastise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and punished.</v>

226
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.573
<v Speaker 1>Here bojack craves the feeling of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>held accountable by the world for the </v>

227
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:52.581
<v Speaker 1>same exact reason he craves it's company</v>
<v Speaker 1>praise and romantic attention because he</v>

228
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:53.974
<v Speaker 1>has no consistent sense of self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needs the world to reconcile his </v>

229
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:58.474
<v Speaker 1>persona as lovable Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading man and narcissistic creep </v>

230
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>because he can't seem to do it on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

231
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>A soap actualized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane is no longer interested in playing</v>

232
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 1>bojack's games and diagnosis is request </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what it is self serving.</v>

233
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane convinces him,</v>

234
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 1>but the only person whose job it is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold him accountable.</v>

235
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 1>He is himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am asking to be held accountable</v>

236
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.990
<v Speaker 5>and I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to happen.</v>

237
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.280
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you put in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one is going to hold you accountable.</v>

238
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.260
<v Speaker 5>You need to take responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself</v>

239
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>and faster than UPC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Narcotics anonymous.</v>

240
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.473
<v Speaker 1>She's persuaded him to go to Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are we to take from bojack </v>

241
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>season five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cannot rely on other people.</v>

242
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Bojack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

243
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.420
<v Speaker 1>not quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

244
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Jack and his dad's certainly know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a pessimistic spin,</v>

245
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>our relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we shouldn't buy into their bleakest</v>

246
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:45.844
<v Speaker 1>insights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we can't hide ourselves in the </v>

247
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:48.214
<v Speaker 1>company of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have options beyond live and die </v>

248
00:12:50.331 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While romantic relationships may fail or</v>

249
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:54.094
<v Speaker 1>prove toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the platonic friendships that </v>

250
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:56.824
<v Speaker 1>radiate through season five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the budding roommate hood </v>

251
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.244
<v Speaker 1>between todd and Princess Carolyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the lasting bond between Diane and </v>

252
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:04.024
<v Speaker 1>bojack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may have their ups and downs and </v>

253
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 1>stolen cheese sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they prove uniquely enduring.</v>

254
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Bojack starts the season claiming he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need anyone,</v>

255
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.413
<v Speaker 1>but he ends up knowing there's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who you can count on his friend </v>

256
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.433
<v Speaker 1>Diane.</v>

257
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we all alone in the world?</v>

258
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.033
<v Speaker 1>Our romantic relationships elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 1>traps for making us feel bad about </v>

259
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and is there power in being </v>
