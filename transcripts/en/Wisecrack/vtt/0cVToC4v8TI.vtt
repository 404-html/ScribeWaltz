00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Hey wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack jared again and today we're </v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>talking about everyone's favorite anime </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an uncomfortable amount of underage</v>

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.443
<v Speaker 1>crotch fondling a curatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aamas enduring and much beloved dragon </v>

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragon ball may appear to be little more</v>

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>than a run of the mill adventure show </v>
<v Speaker 1>for kids.</v>

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.283
<v Speaker 1>The series and it's spinoffs actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have roots in some pretty hefty </v>

7
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>philosophical material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many fans are aware that in creating the</v>

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:26.544
<v Speaker 1>earliest episodes of Dragon Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyama drew inspiration from a 500 year </v>

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:30.624
<v Speaker 1>old Chinese classic journey to the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These superficial similarities are easy </v>

10
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>to spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both feature a group of four adventurers</v>

11
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>in search of powerful magical objects </v>
<v Speaker 1>among them,</v>

12
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>a monkey like creature with a magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff,</v>

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>a horny piggish looking fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Often overlooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however is the fact that dragon ball,</v>

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>much like journey to the West can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>read as an explicitly Buddhist allegory.</v>

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Indeed a show that many of us watched in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our underwear on Saturday mornings while</v>

17
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.214
<v Speaker 1>wolfing down cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris offers a surprising take on </v>

18
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements of Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine.</v>

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.033
<v Speaker 1>Welcome his wise crack addition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of dragon ball and note to </v>

20
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:05.904
<v Speaker 1>the die hard fans keeping score at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since a full discussion of the extended </v>

21
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Dragon Ball universe would take quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

22
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.883
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll focus mainly on the episodes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the original animate most heavily </v>

23
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.364
<v Speaker 1>influenced by journey to the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 13 episodes comprising the emperor </v>

24
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>loft saga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick refresher.</v>

25
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.413
<v Speaker 1>Dragonball follows Goku a young boy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monkey tale and superhuman strength </v>

26
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.003
<v Speaker 1>and Bouma a girl who plans to collect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon balls in order to wish for a </v>

27
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>new boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Along the way,</v>

28
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the team up with oolong a shape shifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pig and yum cha,</v>

29
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>a desert dwelling band that with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crippling fear of women,</v>

30
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.313
<v Speaker 1>they are in a race against time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect all seven dragon balls before </v>

31
00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>the evil emperor Pilaf can snag them for</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

32
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.393
<v Speaker 1>At the last moment when Pilaf has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathered all the dragon balls and it's </v>

33
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:48.904
<v Speaker 1>about to wish for world domination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oolong saves the day by sabotaging his </v>

34
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>wish.</v>

35
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.533
<v Speaker 2>I want to have no world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world's most cocky about parallel </v>

36
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.233
<v Speaker 2>track</v>

37
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.843
<v Speaker 1>journey to the west follows trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit tikka a Buddhist monk and his three </v>

38
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>disciples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey pigs,</v>

39
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:06.784
<v Speaker 1>he and sandy on their quest to locate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bring back sacred Buddhist scrolls </v>

40
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:10.874
<v Speaker 1>to the Chinese court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the pilgrims arrived at the </v>

41
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:13.184
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scrolls they received out to be </v>

42
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:16.064
<v Speaker 1>completely blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While journey to the West involves </v>

43
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>character searching for a magical </v>
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>

44
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>there's more to it than your basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying fetch quests.</v>

45
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>The novel is often read as a Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegory,</v>

46
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>one concerned with spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened.</v>

47
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.143
<v Speaker 1>The characters move from a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance to one of insight as they get </v>

48
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>closer to their destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprisingly enough,</v>

49
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>the same applies to dragonball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Dragon Ball and journey to the West</v>

50
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:39.194
<v Speaker 1>have their philosophical grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Mahayana Buddhism de Vastly </v>

51
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:42.824
<v Speaker 1>oversimplified the Mayana approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism is distinguished from the </v>

52
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:46.244
<v Speaker 1>earlier teravata school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice emphasis on the collective </v>

53
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment of all sentient beings in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe rather than that of any one</v>

54
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.714
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

55
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.703
<v Speaker 1>Accordingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon ball puts a premium on acts of </v>

56
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.344
<v Speaker 1>compassion and on the growth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group as a when the heroes are dragging </v>

57
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put others first.</v>

58
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.613
<v Speaker 1>They advance in their quest when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>act selfishly and refuse to see things </v>

59
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>from other's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their progress is delayed.</v>

60
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.753
<v Speaker 1>In the second episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goku and Boma encounter a beach turtle </v>

61
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.024
<v Speaker 1>who explains that he's lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish there was a way we could help </v>

62
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

63
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:17.464
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you like me to carry you to the </v>

64
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>scene?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Turtle while go,</v>

65
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>who wants to put their journey on hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to help the turtle?</v>

66
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Boma wants to get right back to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>quest to find the dragon ball.</v>

67
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.753
<v Speaker 2>We're on an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have time to transport a beach </v>

68
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 2>turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

69
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go coups.</v>

70
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.034
<v Speaker 1>Active compassion unexpectedly turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the most direct route to the next </v>

71
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>dragonball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter master Roshi hermit and pervert.</v>

72
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.594
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinary Roshi is grateful to go Ku</v>
<v Speaker 1>for returning the turtle to the sea and </v>

73
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>gives Goku his iconic flying Nimbus </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud as a reward.</v>

74
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.403
<v Speaker 1>You also happens to own a dragon ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he's willing to give the boma and </v>

75
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>exchange for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird show guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethical implications of trading peep</v>

77
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>shows for magical jewelry aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact remains that Boba and Goku find</v>

78
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>the dragonball because Goku is willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to delay his own gratification and rover</v>

79
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.703
<v Speaker 1>to help out a fellow being in need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So aren't you glad we decided to help </v>

80
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the turtle now it paid off.</v>

81
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I sure am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are so right.</v>

82
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it as the series goes on.</v>

83
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.193
<v Speaker 1>Goku spends a lot of time dragging </v>
<v Speaker 1>around his useless childhood friends </v>

84
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>while doing all the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crillon did that ain't compassion.</v>

86
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this correlation between ethical</v>

87
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:33.824
<v Speaker 1>behavior and speed of progress is lifted</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight from journey to the West in </v>

88
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:41.120
<v Speaker 1>which a lack of compassion on part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilgrims causes delays that can only</v>

89
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:43.520
<v Speaker 1>be resolved through compassion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

90
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.623
<v Speaker 1>Monkey often gets in fights with </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters only to realize that those </v>

91
00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:48.254
<v Speaker 1>monsters were supposed to help him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Peggy and sandy start out his foes </v>

92
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.603
<v Speaker 1>only to eventually become allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes part of the way toward </v>

93
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:56.174
<v Speaker 1>explaining early dragon balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected attitude toward violence for </v>

94
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:01.520
<v Speaker 1>a franchise that would eventually go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to features,</v>

95
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:04.160
<v Speaker 1>scenes such as this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

96
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

97
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.893
<v Speaker 1>and this.</v>

98
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.793
<v Speaker 1>Dragon ball and its earliest episodes as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a surprising lack of violence like </v>

99
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:18.904
<v Speaker 1>journey to the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show is preoccupied with a </v>

100
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>particular Buddhist conception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonviolence.</v>

101
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Violence is not universally wrong so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as it is cumbersome to some degree.</v>

102
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It does get in the way of insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conversely,</v>

103
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>compassion facilitates spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

104
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>This understanding of violence as </v>
<v Speaker 1>roadblock is most clearly displayed with</v>

105
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the ox cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the group first meets the ox,</v>

106
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:39.784
<v Speaker 1>King Goku tries to beat him up in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clear the pathway of Fire Mountain </v>

107
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.863
<v Speaker 1>and take his dragon ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enormous man barely feels go cruise </v>

108
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:47.734
<v Speaker 1>attacks for the duration of this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone involved is stuck in an </v>

109
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.603
<v Speaker 1>unproductive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointless cycle that gets the pilgrims </v>

110
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.604
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is only when Goku and the ox king </v>

111
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.394
<v Speaker 1>begin to each other's needs through </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that the team gets any </v>

112
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.244
<v Speaker 1>closer to their goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are collecting these and I think you </v>

113
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:04.604
<v Speaker 1>have one.</v>

114
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen one in my cousin so of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course you could have it.</v>

115
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>My new little friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and understanding rather than</v>

116
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>violence lead to the trade that </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually nets the team.</v>

117
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.604
<v Speaker 1>Another dragon ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is all well and good when you're </v>

118
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>dealing with a scary but ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmless threat like the ox king.</v>

119
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>But how should our heroes approach a </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat that can't be reasoned with?</v>

120
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>According to writer Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Fleischman,</v>

121
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.573
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhist approach to nonviolence </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes room for this kind of scenario as </v>

122
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.294
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>permitting someone else to perpetrate </v>

123
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>harm without consequences is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonviolence.</v>

124
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Defending innocent lives with violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>means is hardly ideal,</v>

125
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's preferable to rigid pacifism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last few episodes of the emperor</v>

126
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.124
<v Speaker 1>p Loft Saga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the team is confronted with an </v>

127
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>existential threat when Goku turns into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant ape at the site of the full moon</v>

128
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>and threatens to eat boma.</v>

129
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.103
<v Speaker 1>So Yom Chupp wore an oolong cutoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go coos tail to safe Boma and stop Goku </v>

130
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>from doing something he'd later regret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're limited use of violence prevents</v>

131
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>worst violence down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way at least nobody dies.</v>

132
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.453
<v Speaker 1>This more nuanced understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence would pop up in Torrey aamas </v>

133
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.024
<v Speaker 1>later work as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to go description of himself in </v>

134
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>response to freeze his question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

135
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

136
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:17.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm the hope of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the answer to all living things </v>

137
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:24.660
<v Speaker 1>that cry out for peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am protector of the innocent.</v>

138
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I am the light in the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am true nightmare.</v>

139
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.293
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the various villains that maim </v>
<v Speaker 1>and murder throughout the series go Ku </v>

140
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.344
<v Speaker 1>commits violent acts to preserve peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps most interesting is how dragon </v>

141
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.670
<v Speaker 1>ball handles the Buddhist concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>empties.</v>

142
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.603
<v Speaker 1>The idea that things in themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how no inherent or fixed essence early </v>

143
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.134
<v Speaker 1>on Toyama asks us to consider this </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept in relation to the dragon balls </v>

144
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.173
<v Speaker 1>are these gems have the power to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>great things and not so great from the </v>

145
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

146
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 1>The series points out that the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls are neither inherently good,</v>

147
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.523
<v Speaker 1>bad or anything in between there simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>a store of potential energy use to </v>

148
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:09.220
<v Speaker 1>fulfill wishes even so the hero's revere</v>
<v Speaker 1>them as a life changing miracles.</v>

149
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.243
<v Speaker 1>Their disposition toward the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls mirrors the pilgrims attitude </v>

150
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>toward the sacred scrolls in journey to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the west.</v>

151
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>When the Buddha's assistants actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them scrolls that are blank,</v>

152
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>they are more than a little pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they shouldn't be.</v>

153
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Scholar Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are used at the blankness of the </v>

154
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:25.844
<v Speaker 1>scrolls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a material manifestation of the </v>

155
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:28.184
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist doctrine of emptiness assigned </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing to the nature of ultimate </v>

156
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:32.474
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha himself explains to the </v>

157
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:34.664
<v Speaker 1>pilgrims that as a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is such blank scrolls as these that </v>

158
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>are the true scriptures by undercutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their expectations.</v>

159
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.893
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha provides the pilgrims with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound lesson about the nature of </v>

160
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.284
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that it's empty of any inherent </v>

161
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>essence.</v>

162
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.853
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prank actually advances their </v>

163
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:51.254
<v Speaker 1>spiritual progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A similar bait and switch occurs in </v>

164
00:08:53.371 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>dragon ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

165
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.403
<v Speaker 1>oolongs panty wish by ruining pilafs </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish oolong undercuts the hero's </v>

166
00:08:59.011 --> 00:08:59.844
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning something as momentous as the </v>

167
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>summoning of the eternal dragon into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

168
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>While the dragon balls may have provided</v>
<v Speaker 1>oolong with a pair of Panties,</v>

169
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 1>they haven't changed anyone's life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any meaningful way,</v>

170
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say the journey was for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing far from it in both the show and</v>

171
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:16.554
<v Speaker 1>the novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revelation of the quests inherent </v>

172
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.133
<v Speaker 1>emptiness serves as a catalyst for </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth beyond what the characters </v>

173
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.763
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the final chapters of journey to the </v>

174
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.344
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilgrims are made into high ranking </v>

175
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:27.444
<v Speaker 1>members of the Buddhist Paradise while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes of dragon ball gain insight </v>

176
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.760
<v Speaker 1>into the true scope of their various </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

177
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 1>which turned out to be not as terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>or permanent as they thought.</v>

178
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.923
<v Speaker 1>Boma and Yom Cha plan to use the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls to find a boyfriend and cure </v>

179
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 1>social anxiety respectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after long pulses stunt they realize</v>

180
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the solution to their mutual problem has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in front of them the whole time.</v>

181
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.713
<v Speaker 1>They agree to get together on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobo lets go of her need for perfection </v>

182
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and Yom sure lets go of his fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Oolong who we first meet kidnapping</v>

183
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.604
<v Speaker 1>young girls to staff his would be Harem </v>
<v Speaker 1>has learned to find happiness in </v>

184
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>thinking about others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides himself.</v>

185
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>When asked whether he will accompany Yom</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying boma to the city,</v>

186
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.240
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

187
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys need me.</v>

188
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>So turtles flashing panties and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All in all a pretty weird way of getting</v>

189
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>a religious message across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of the point.</v>

190
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.330
<v Speaker 1>My Yana Buddhism with its emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching and collective enlightenment is</v>

191
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:22.164
<v Speaker 1>big into the concept of skillful means </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the guiding of Cindy and beings </v>

192
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>toward enlightenment according to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>current abilities and other words,</v>

193
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 1>meeting people where they're at.</v>

194
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.523
<v Speaker 1>One way to meet people where they're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to dispense with the dry lecturing </v>

195
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.393
<v Speaker 1>and tell them a damn good story and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is exactly what dragon ball and journey </v>

196
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.804
<v Speaker 1>to the west do with engaging plotlines </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative characters and writing that is </v>

197
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:44.424
<v Speaker 1>alternatively tense and hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragonball successfully weaves Buddhist </v>

198
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.984
<v Speaker 1>morals into a story that people love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to again and again and it's </v>

199
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>bad as thanks for watching wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't get enough dragon ball.</v>
