<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watches in sunglasses,</v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>more on movement at the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.461
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack,</v>

4
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.294
<v Speaker 1>jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all just saw thor ragnarok and </v>

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some thoughts.</v>

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it quite possibly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest smart movie,</v>

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>it's also very close to being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smartest.</v>

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.303
<v Speaker 1>Like most marvel clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a metric buttload of smashy </v>

9
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:23.551
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

10
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>punctuated by smug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self awareness is a friend from work,</v>

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>but underneath the ocean of jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and uncredited Matt Damon Cameos.</v>

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>There are a few scenes that speak to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting ideas,</v>

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but before we dive in any further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your obligatory spoiler warning.</v>

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>One of the most enduring images of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie is thor missing,</v>

15
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>and I just like his father odin and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't help but ponder.</v>

16
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.343
<v Speaker 1>If in norse mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>odin loses his eye to see a greater </v>

17
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:52.944
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What truth does thor see when he loses </v>

18
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.003
<v Speaker 1>his eye?</v>

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>So let's see why marvel took thor's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I in this quick take on Thor Ragnarok.</v>

20
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.463
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap for returns to as garden </v>

21
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>from a spirit quest complete with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crown of a fire.</v>

22
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Giant only defined Loki in charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>disguised as Odin.</v>

23
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.673
<v Speaker 1>They go to find the real odin who </v>
<v Speaker 1>promptly dies immediately after big </v>

24
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:14.964
<v Speaker 1>sister Hela Goddess of death comes back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from her banishment to hot topic to </v>

25
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>claim the as guardian thrown and expand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the empire.</v>

26
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>So she destroys thor's hammer and sends </v>
<v Speaker 1>thor and Loki tumbling in the space.</v>

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Thor ends up being a gladiator on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet called Secar.</v>

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Loki weasels himself into Jeff Gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>boons aristocracy.</v>

29
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>And with the help of new friends like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Valkyrie and his colleague,</v>

30
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:35.964
<v Speaker 1>the incredible hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thor gets back to asgard by Tele and </v>

31
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>saves his people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a ride.</v>

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Door fights the hulk again.</v>

33
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Goldwin plays a space.</v>

34
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Cj and Loki gets rescued by Acuvi rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

35
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.293
<v Speaker 1>But what's more interesting is rackner </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur occupation with the past </v>

36
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.643
<v Speaker 1>and how it forms the world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is most clearly seen during hellos </v>

37
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>reign over as guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When hello arrives,</v>

38
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.034
<v Speaker 1>She sees a fresco depicting as guards </v>
<v Speaker 1>history as all peace treaties and </v>

39
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.054
<v Speaker 1>celebrations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not how she remembers it to </v>

40
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:06.654
<v Speaker 1>her as guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History is all blood and conquest and </v>

41
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>feeding enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tour giant Wolf.</v>

42
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.813
<v Speaker 1>She wrecks the fresco revealing one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden beneath one that depicts the </v>

43
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Odin tried to sweep under the rug.</v>

44
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>He anhelica conquering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing,</v>

45
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.023
<v Speaker 1>and generally wreaking havoc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She destroys what appears to be the </v>

46
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:24.564
<v Speaker 1>entire as guardian army on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then brings her old army's back to life </v>

47
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and suddenly as guard is just like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she left it,</v>

48
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>a military dictatorship run by a power </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry deity.</v>

49
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.293
<v Speaker 1>What's really clever here is that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>as hello wants to reach into the dark </v>

50
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and bring the past back to life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to do all our central characters need</v>

51
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>to reconcile with their past in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make any progress.</v>

52
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the substance buried under all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy in this movie.</v>

53
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>It's interested in how we deal with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

54
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>For the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is simple.</v>

55
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Banner has been stuck in hoke mode for </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

56
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.663
<v Speaker 1>It's not until he witnesses his past by </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing a video of black widow that he's </v>

57
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>forced to confront what he left behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he flew into outer space,</v>

58
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>allowing banner to emerge and the escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>to truly start.</v>

59
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Valkyrie used to be a member of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite,</v>

60
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>all female as guardians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strikeforce,</v>

61
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.853
<v Speaker 1>but ages ago when Hella killed everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>but her and a huge battle she gave up </v>

62
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>that life and became a scavenger.</v>

63
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.893
<v Speaker 1>It's only when she confronts those </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories that she can return to the </v>

64
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>heroism she left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lokeys confrontation with the past comes</v>

65
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>through his connection to his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loki has always wanted thor to recognize</v>

66
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>him either with love or fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but toward the end of the movie,</v>

67
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Dor indicates that he no longer cares </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Loki.</v>

68
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>It takes until the last 20 minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>

69
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>but Loki finally realizes that to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own future,</v>

70
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>he has to grow out of the person he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past.</v>

71
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Despite his self aggrandizing battle cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your savior is here.</v>

72
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.163
<v Speaker 1>We see real growth in his decision not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to steal the tesseract and in the fact </v>

73
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>that after the fight he sticks around </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of running away.</v>

74
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>But what about thor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:03.394
<v Speaker 1>that's the biggest issue with this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of history and what keeps the film from </v>

76
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>being decisively Marvel's smartest </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

77
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>We never get to see thor dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own history,</v>

78
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>nor with as guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest we get to this is his battle</v>

79
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:16.384
<v Speaker 1>with hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be considered as a </v>

80
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical conflict between as God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and it's past.</v>

81
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.750
<v Speaker 1>This is the concept of the heart of full</v>
<v Speaker 1>ragnar rock.</v>

82
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>In order to move into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and societies need to reckon with</v>

83
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>their past and idea that is very present</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout human history.</v>

84
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.063
<v Speaker 1>It starts with the way that society's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell stories to themselves about </v>

85
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:36.664
<v Speaker 1>themselves for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as God presented itself as a warlike </v>

86
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Odin one of the shift toward a more</v>

87
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.844
<v Speaker 1>peaceful arrangement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rewrote the history of as guard to </v>

88
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.874
<v Speaker 1>exclude Hela and all the fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>position himself as a benevolent </v>

89
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.624
<v Speaker 1>protector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard the phrase that </v>

90
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.174
<v Speaker 1>history is written by the winners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to scholars like Michelle </v>

91
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>from co and Jenny Ed Kins history is </v>
<v Speaker 1>written for the winners,</v>

92
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>but what that means is that history is </v>
<v Speaker 1>written to justify past violence and set</v>

93
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>the stage for whatever needs to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

94
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Atkins explains this process by </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing the end of a war.</v>

95
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.393
<v Speaker 1>Victory Parades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remembrance ceremonies and war museums </v>

96
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>tell of glory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage and sacrifice.</v>

97
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.913
<v Speaker 1>The Nation is renewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state strengthened with the </v>

98
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:17.944
<v Speaker 1>commemoration of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We justify the measures taken to reach </v>

99
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.424
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means the story of the past </v>

100
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.063
<v Speaker 1>dictates the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this idea played with at the </v>

101
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>beginning when lokeys disguises Odin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's putting on a play recontextualizing</v>

102
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:31.954
<v Speaker 1>his deception as sacrifice and rewriting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of as guard with himself as </v>

103
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all wild munching on fresh grapes.</v>

104
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.143
<v Speaker 1>The as guard around him is centered on </v>
<v Speaker 1>indulgence and celebration and Loki </v>

105
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>crafts its history to justify that </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

106
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.343
<v Speaker 1>He's not the only one to pull this trick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's certainly not the most </v>

107
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:50.674
<v Speaker 1>dangerous for Hela as guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History is inextricably tied to this </v>

108
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.724
<v Speaker 1>idea of place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She believes that expanding the </v>

109
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>territory of as guard is the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>making as guard.</v>

110
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>More powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This equation of a people to a place has</v>

111
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.094
<v Speaker 1>a long role in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theorist David Campbell explains the </v>

112
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>dangers of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political identity,</v>

113
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:09.584
<v Speaker 1>and security to a single place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of his ideas is essentially that </v>

114
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:13.964
<v Speaker 1>when a population and its power is tied </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a place that makes everyone outside </v>

115
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.004
<v Speaker 1>of that place and enemy and a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat and in a world full of potential </v>

116
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:23.744
<v Speaker 1>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety is an illusion and that means </v>

117
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.640
<v Speaker 1>hell is wars would wage forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a visit from ghost dad for thor</v>

118
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.483
<v Speaker 1>to understand that the people of Asgard </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter more than the place or even the </v>

119
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the epiphany that lead owed into</v>

120
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.474
<v Speaker 1>casting hell out her militarism based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>defending the land of as guard from </v>

121
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>threats or expanding its power would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruin of the people of Asgard.</v>

122
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.930

<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>

123
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Odin trades his iphone knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

124
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:54.554
<v Speaker 1>thor loses his eye in the moment when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally sees the truth that what really </v>

125
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>matters isn't territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the people who create the culture.</v>

126
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.253
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loki unleashes the fire giant who </v>

127
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.354
<v Speaker 1>destroys as guard and hello whippet by </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying the territory and making the </v>

<v Speaker 1>as guardians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nomadic space travelers.</v>

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.403
<v Speaker 1>They now have a chance to create their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own history unbound from the past </v>

130
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>despite the pain it brings underneath a </v>
<v Speaker 1>secar sized pile of space,</v>
