00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live action.</v>

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Jared here these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media means everything we do ends</v>

3
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.174
<v Speaker 1>up on permanent record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just being on the Internet is a </v>

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>minefield and there's no survival guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>for handling.</v>

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>We're not the only ones worrying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it either.</v>

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>As the newest episode of Southpark </v>
<v Speaker 1>tackles these ideas head on.</v>

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So let's get into this quick take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>season 21 episode three holiday special.</v>

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.513
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead if you've been listening </v>

9
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>to our ourself park podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect our authortalk,</v>

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.363
<v Speaker 1>you know that we've been fascinated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that this season has been more </v>

11
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.024
<v Speaker 1>focused on people's reaction to world </v>
<v Speaker 1>events rather than the events </v>

12
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.384
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has never been more clear than in </v>

13
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>this past episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holiday Special Randy's quest for social</v>

14
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>justice hits a lot of ideas right on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose,</v>

15
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>but it also raises some really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting questions.</v>

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick recap.</v>

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Randy caught up and yet a nother wave of</v>
<v Speaker 1>activism gets Columbus State canceled,</v>

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.343
<v Speaker 1>which means no more day off school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's still not enough for south </v>

19
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>park's most vocal father.</v>

20
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>He sets off to tear down a statue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>takes a crap and Columbus circle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>berate the residents of Columbus,</v>

22
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an intolerant pig.</v>

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.903
<v Speaker 1>You just choose to live in a city named </v>
<v Speaker 1>for ethnic cleansing is activism keeps </v>

25
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>escalating until the kids discover a </v>
<v Speaker 1>treasure trove of instagram.</v>

26
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Pictures depicting randy in Columbus </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy goes to great lengths,</v>

28
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.953
<v Speaker 1>including falsifying a DNA test in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>randy way possible to inoculate himself </v>

29
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>against criticism by presenting himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a native American,</v>

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.441
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>

31
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>A descendant of Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These victims.</v>

32
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.613
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy finds out that he's just an </v>

33
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.653
<v Speaker 1>average white dude of European descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with more than average amount of </v>

34
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:49.974
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fact he spins into his own story of </v>

35
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:53.634
<v Speaker 1>victim hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth wasn't big enough for the </v>

36
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Andrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts to your ancestors.</v>

37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.504
<v Speaker 1>Just got rid of them up after all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal homo sapiens for race </v>

38
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>neanderthals from the face of the earth.</v>

39
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>So what does Randy's quest tell us about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world we live in?</v>

40
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.193
<v Speaker 1>Well more than you might think and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain why we're turning to something </v>

41
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about in one of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking dead videos.</v>

42
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.553
<v Speaker 1>The pen off the con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panopticon is an idea originally </v>

43
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:16.674
<v Speaker 1>created by philosopher Jeremy Bentham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a prison where a single guard in a </v>

44
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:20.934
<v Speaker 1>tower can watch all the inmates at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prisoners can't tell if they're </v>

45
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.194
<v Speaker 1>being watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to always be on their best </v>

46
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But postmodern theorists,</v>

47
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:29.664
<v Speaker 1>Michel Foucault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was a perfect metaphor for </v>

48
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:32.214
<v Speaker 1>how society controls that citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we never know when our actions </v>

49
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>might result in punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We try our best to follow the rules,</v>

50
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.403
<v Speaker 1>which means we'd become controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>those rules even when no one enforces </v>

51
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:44.304
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even internalize those rules and </v>

52
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know if we're acting because</v>

53
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>of our beliefs or because of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>systemic control and fear of punishment.</v>

54
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.423
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for Randy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media has become a kind of real </v>

55
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.574
<v Speaker 1>life panopticon don't post that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything we do exist on the Internet </v>

56
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.114
<v Speaker 1>for forever and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have to be careful with what we </v>

57
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>do and what we say online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy feels this in a very real way.</v>

58
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.553
<v Speaker 1>When the kids discover his prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>predilection for Columbus because he's </v>

59
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.214
<v Speaker 1>always being watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy has internalized his fear of </v>

60
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.484
<v Speaker 1>punishment and his desire to live up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>social ideals as a means of creating </v>

61
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>social capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys found those pictures online.</v>

62
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>It's only a matter of time before </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else does.</v>

63
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.743
<v Speaker 1>People won't care about what I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll just see me as a thoughtless </v>

64
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>indigenous son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

65
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.074
<v Speaker 1>as a perpetual band wagoner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy needs to be a guy who protest </v>

66
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Columbus because that's what he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>society wants from him,</v>

67
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.123
<v Speaker 1>but with the advent of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly terrified of what his </v>

68
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>peers might uncover about his past.</v>

69
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.063
<v Speaker 1>Once the points Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon they're going to become an </v>

70
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With social media,</v>

71
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>our culture is evolving faster than </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

72
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.543
<v Speaker 1>but it's also becoming or judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes made in the past are looked at </v>

73
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:56.074
<v Speaker 1>through the lens of the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because he's suddenly not cool now </v>

74
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean I'm going to be the scape </v>
<v Speaker 1>goat.</v>

75
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.923
<v Speaker 1>This goes for both Columbus who </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely did horrible things and </v>

76
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>randy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just kind of an idiot.</v>

77
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.713
<v Speaker 1>It's only now when everyone's being so </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous to me that I realized how </v>

78
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>indigenous I've been acting all along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy tries to explain that he's changed</v>

79
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that what he did in the past shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

80
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was younger,</v>

81
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.813
<v Speaker 1>we were all young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another time you have to </v>

82
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>understand it was 2013 two bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>randy.</v>

83
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no codified statue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations on bad behavior.</v>

84
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.913
<v Speaker 1>Randy gets caught acting in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>with ways not entirely kosher with the </v>

85
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

86
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>He can't be an advocate for a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's seen as disingenuous and sends,</v>

87
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Randy defines himself by his project of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the week.</v>

88
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>He can't afford to let that happen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because social media judges all action,</v>

89
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>we often fetishize purity when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to social issues.</v>

90
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I'm from New York,</v>

91
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.933
<v Speaker 1>I drive around a big circle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrates a guy who murdered native </v>

92
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily for Randy,</v>

93
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>he stumbles across the commercial for </v>
<v Speaker 1>appears to be a perfect solution.</v>

94
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.363
<v Speaker 1>DNA in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you like to know the story of </v>

95
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes you you?</v>

96
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>The DNA testing program lets people </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim affinity with marginalized groups.</v>

97
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm on cell part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Asian and even some Kurdish.</v>

98
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm a victim of oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they aren't apparently a part of</v>

99
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>them DNA and be showed I was 8% Navajo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody making fun of me.</v>

100
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Now are my people who are victims.</v>

101
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.373
<v Speaker 1>The ability to claim victim hood enables</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to stake out a moral high ground </v>

102
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>and make themselves immune from </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>

103
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Are you in health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

104
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:35.494
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the irony of this is a course that </v>

105
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:37.894
<v Speaker 1>most people who need a DNA test to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out if they're victims of oppression </v>

106
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>probably are not oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 13% victim.</v>

107
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm 21% victim to protect himself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential fallout.</v>

108
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Randy pays a native American to make out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him in order to guarantee he'll end</v>

109
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>up with the DNA of an indigenous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In doing this,</v>

110
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:56.854
<v Speaker 1>randy demonstrates and indifference </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the feelings of the native </v>

111
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>American man who ends up falling in love</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

112
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.543
<v Speaker 1>I have never felt so alive and tone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even managers to recreate the misdeeds </v>

113
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>of Columbus all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get off my land,</v>

114
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:10.634
<v Speaker 1>you'll pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all adds up to show that randy's </v>

115
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>political aspirations are ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish.</v>

116
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>He's so desperate to claim victim hood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so utterly ill informed about pretty</v>

117
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>much everything that he leans on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>2.8%</v>

118
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.224
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They claim that his people were erased </v>

119
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>from history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:28.724
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gang up on the neanderthal </v>

121
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>visited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny again,</v>

122
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Randy's bizarre behavior raises </v>
<v Speaker 1>something important.</v>

123
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>How do we decide when people can claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim hood?</v>

124
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.170
<v Speaker 1>That's not to minimize the suffering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

125
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.023
<v Speaker 1>but how do we distinguish between people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are legitimately effected by a </v>

126
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:44.864
<v Speaker 1>legacy of oppression and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get in trouble for always </v>

127
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>using the n word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with DNA and me,</v>

128
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>I found out that I'm 2.1%</v>
<v Speaker 1>black morning Steve,</v>

129
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the line?</v>

130
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.163
<v Speaker 1>How close do you need to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family tree for oppression to be passed </v>

131
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly a thousand years is too much,</v>

132
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>but what about a hundred years or 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

133
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Even five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated debate,</v>

134
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.743
<v Speaker 1>but we know exactly what randy thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>even tens of thousands of years is fair </v>

135
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

136
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.143
<v Speaker 1>All these ideas add up to one compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minute critique of how we approach </v>

137
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>politics in the age of social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Questions of how we deal with our public</v>

138
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:22.034
<v Speaker 1>lives being saved online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we treat past mistakes and how we </v>

139
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:25.784
<v Speaker 1>understand victimhood in our hyper aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>era are ones that we need to answer and </v>

140
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>South Park knows that until we resolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

141
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.913
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a whole lot of misguided </v>
<v Speaker 1>randy's running around and causing </v>

142
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:37.784
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the show is ultimately </v>

143
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:39.914
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to figure out how we talk to </v>

144
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:42.524
<v Speaker 1>each other about history and complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas of culture or else we'll just be </v>

145
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>crossing wires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making messes and in public places.</v>

146
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.713
<v Speaker 1>The 21st season of south park wants us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think how we handle an increasingly </v>

147
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>complicated world that demands faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and less nuanced reactions.</v>

148
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to Overdo it in today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

149
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:00.734
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be nuanced and subtle anymore </v>

150
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Critics go,</v>

151
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the point of that?</v>

152
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>The show doesn't have answers though and</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither do we,</v>

153
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.203
<v Speaker 1>but the first step is asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to hear these questions </v>
