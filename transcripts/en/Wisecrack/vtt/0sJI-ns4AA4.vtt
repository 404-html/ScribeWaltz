<v Speaker 1>Talking with them doesn't mean not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having sanctions on them.</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>We would continue to have sanctions the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way we do now.</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just a question of making progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>while those sanctions are in place.</v>

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>We had sanctions on Iraq for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

5
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>We didn't make a great deal of progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>in dismantling the well.</v>

6
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>We claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or George Bush claim that we didn't make</v>

7
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>any progress in dismantling the weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mass destruction program,</v>

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>which was why he claimed we had to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in again.</v>

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.373
<v Speaker 1>So sanctions alone don't do much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we asked earlier about hard and </v>

10
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:35.004
<v Speaker 1>soft power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it's a whole combination of </v>

11
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>things that have to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an example.</v>
