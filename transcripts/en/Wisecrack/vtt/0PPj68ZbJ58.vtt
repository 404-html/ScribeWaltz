1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 2>well it's always been a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big breakthroughs and transportation</v>

3
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.150
<v Speaker 2>has always been propulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>however you're gonna how you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the vehicle going from,</v>

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 2>from the ground transportation side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 2>horse and buggies gave way to a steam </v>
<v Speaker 2>engines,</v>

7
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 2>locomotives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first practical small gasoline </v>

9
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 2>engine and the cars first cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a steam ships,</v>

10
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>sailing ships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave way to steam ships,</v>

11
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 2>gave away to diesel and nuclear powered </v>
<v Speaker 2>vessels.</v>

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.531
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.364
<v Speaker 2>the airplane started out as these tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>little engine's turning propellors to a </v>

14
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 2>turbo props and modern propeller </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplanes to the jet engine,</v>

15
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 2>advent of the jet engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turbo jets,</v>

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 2>and then two turbo fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were efficient enough to allow,</v>

17
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air transportation system as it is </v>

18
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.044
<v Speaker 2>today to develop same as rockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rockets have remained fundamentally </v>

19
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 2>unchanged except for a few exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 2>for the last almost 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for there to be a fundamental shift in,</v>

22
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.423
<v Speaker 2>in rocketry and getting into space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there almost has to be a breakthrough </v>

23
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.034
<v Speaker 2>and propulsion either and how to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>the price down or how to more </v>

24
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 2>efficiently get people up into space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

25
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.943
<v Speaker 2>as we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key barrier is the expensive a </v>

26
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:19.424
<v Speaker 2>rocket.</v>

27
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.353
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of getting enough energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get off of the planet and into lower </v>

28
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 2>earth orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.613
<v Speaker 2>it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a fixed amount of energy to do </v>

30
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>that per massive payload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that part is fixed.</v>

31
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 2>But how you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get the energy,</v>

32
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.353
<v Speaker 2>how do you extract it from the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>propulsion you're using or if you're </v>

33
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>coming up with a whole new way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

34
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.983
<v Speaker 2>the neatest thing about research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>science is that we don't necessarily </v>

36
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 2>know what's going to come down the pike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

37
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:46.364
<v Speaker 2>we think we know what we're working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes discoveries are made when </v>

38
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to discover something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

39
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up accidentally discovering a </v>

40
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:53.684
<v Speaker 2>different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of those things might happen </v>

41
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.680
<v Speaker 2>then enable us to have more efficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>rockets.</v>

42
00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for me to,</v>

43
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>to kind of guess what that might be.</v>
