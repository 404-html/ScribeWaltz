<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack jared here.</v>

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>If you've been listening to our self </v>
<v Speaker 1>park podcast,</v>

7
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>respect our authortalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>we've been low key obsessed with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting problem south park is</v>

9
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:21.104
<v Speaker 1>facing this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you make social satire when </v>

10
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>reality is already so absurd and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews?</v>

11
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.164
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Trey have noted that liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conservatives frequently praise the </v>

12
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:31.244
<v Speaker 1>same episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each thinking of the show has secretly </v>

13
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:34.184
<v Speaker 1>sided with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after season 20 was all been </v>

14
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 1>railroaded by the 2016 election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jeez.</v>

15
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't look very fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a new valve.</v>

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Avoid trump related narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be CNN.</v>

17
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:46.544
<v Speaker 1>They told the independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with divisive politics dominating </v>

18
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:49.844
<v Speaker 1>our national discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can a show that prides itself on not </v>

19
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>taking sides continue to stay relevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>judging by their latest episode,</v>

20
00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>which manages to take a stance without </v>
<v Speaker 1>resorting to partisan talking points?</v>

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>The answer is absolute.</v>

22
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.943
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this episode is one of my favorite </v>

23
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>indictments of trump on television and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite possibly one of the most nuanced.</v>

24
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.663
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not to say they have anything </v>

25
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>uplifting to say because if there's any </v>
<v Speaker 1>one consistent message this season,</v>

26
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 1>it's that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all to death.</v>

27
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.083
<v Speaker 1>Let's make this country great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack quick take on </v>

28
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>South Park's doubling down and as always</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

29
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.923
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi once again tries to end things </v>

30
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>with Eric probably for something petty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cogni or foreign pushed me in front of a</v>

31
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>

32
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:36.184
<v Speaker 1>he ugly cries and emotionally blackmail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir and just staying with him after </v>

33
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:39.994
<v Speaker 1>watching cartman continue to abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi Kyle makes it his duty to rescue </v>

34
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:44.104
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is our problem and eventually </v>

35
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>realizes he's fallen for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

36
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:49.884
<v Speaker 1>Paul Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Mcconnell and Mike Pence try to </v>

37
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.104
<v Speaker 1>stand up to the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but garrison gives them a little taste </v>

38
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>of his signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can people to death.</v>

39
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.533
<v Speaker 1>Hope you brought some condoms after some</v>
<v Speaker 1>illicit courtship Heidi dumps cartman </v>

40
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>gets with Kyle and carbon vows to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge on his least favorite too.</v>

41
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.003
<v Speaker 1>Things seem to be looking up for Heidi </v>
<v Speaker 1>until her friends make her feel like </v>

42
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 1>forever dating carbon in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

43
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>All the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you,</v>

44
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>so's make Heidi feel hurt and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing her to double down on carbon.</v>

45
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.943
<v Speaker 1>Who presumably gives her an offscreen </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture about the merits of </v>

46
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>antisemitism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know for that.</v>

47
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>People are always trying to get ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in blankets and bruises.</v>

48
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.883
<v Speaker 1>Pence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan and Mcconnell commemorate </v>

49
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>garrison's first anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

50
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.164
<v Speaker 1>As president and garrison reassures them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the next three years will be even </v>

51
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.523
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's so brilliant about this episode </v>

52
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>is how the A and b plots parallel each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

53
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>The main gist is just as Heidi is in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive relationship with Cartman,</v>

54
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>so two are trump supporters in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive relationship with trump.</v>

55
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>The parallel is hinted at early in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode through subtly coded language.</v>

56
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Kyle wondering why Heidi staying with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartman asks,</v>

57
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.110
<v Speaker 2>she's still supporting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves him,</v>

58
00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he clearly sucks.</v>

59
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Really sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever was going on</v>

60
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>here are his wording is deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 1>identical to be stock language.</v>

61
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Critics used to question why trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>voters continue to support him.</v>

62
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.193
<v Speaker 1>Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then straight up ask tidy what the deal </v>

63
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 1>is and here's where the parallel falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly into place.</v>

64
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.893
<v Speaker 1>It turns out Heidi Hartmann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like president garrison are about to </v>

65
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>celebrate their one year</v>

66
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.453
<v Speaker 2>bursary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you and Carmen have an </v>

67
00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 2>anniversary coming up and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering,</v>

68
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:34.200
<v Speaker 2>you've known him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you think he's doing?</v>

69
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Has a boyfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle presses the point,</v>

70
00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:37.194
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using language perfectly suited to </v>

71
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:39.354
<v Speaker 2>trumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of us are thinking that maybe he's </v>

72
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:42.990
<v Speaker 2>not super qualified to be with you</v>

73
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle was pretty clearly playing the role</v>

74
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>of a liberal reporter interviewing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump supporter.</v>

75
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.023
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about carbon that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find remotely redeeming this approach </v>

76
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 2>does not prove very tactful and Heidi </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubles down on Cartman.</v>

77
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.963
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what Eric's like when </v>

78
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>we're alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually really good to me.</v>

79
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.823
<v Speaker 1>Later in the episode we see the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>same exchange in a more familiar </v>

80
00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:07.574
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

81
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.463
<v Speaker 2>Speaker Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the anniversary of the president </v>

82
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 2>being elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you think he's doing well?</v>

83
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean he's great?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing great.</v>

84
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people judge him and just see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative.</v>

85
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>People don't know how great the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president can be behind closed doors.</v>

86
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.913
<v Speaker 1>The irony becomes layered when just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>kyle uses political polling lingo to </v>

87
00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:25.784
<v Speaker 1>talk about Cartman Paul Ryan starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>using language associated with domestic </v>

88
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:30.290
<v Speaker 1>abuse to protect trump</v>

89
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 2>and is that semen on your black art?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Nah,</v>

90
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I tripped on a tornado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

91
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.960
<v Speaker 2>that's thrown up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come</v>

92
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.893
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi finally admits to kyle that she </v>

93
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>may have made a mistake here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

94
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.154
<v Speaker 1>her description of falling for cartman </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like the description reporters </v>

95
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>use to explain how the white working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class voter fail for trump.</v>

96
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Before we started going out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in a really bad place.</v>

97
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.773
<v Speaker 2>I felt pushed away by society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Famous guy came along who told me all </v>

98
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 2>the things I wanted to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just wait with it.</v>

99
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Does that make me a bad person</v>

100
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.933
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle helpfully points out how cartman </v>

101
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 1>like trump constantly plays the victim </v>
<v Speaker 1>to when sympathy.</v>

102
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.693
<v Speaker 1>No run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see ourselves as the victim </v>

103
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:12.554
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but carbon sees himself as the victim </v>

104
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.590
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

105
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Heidis essentially the perfect stand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the regretful trump voter who really</v>

106
00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:20.774
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to admit he was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'm going to face </v>

107
00:05:23.151 --> 00:05:23.984
<v Speaker 1>people with funding and we give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This culminates in a beautiful montage </v>

108
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that essentially sums up the episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight dejected.</v>

109
00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:30.674
<v Speaker 1>Heidi evaluates her relationship and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>took her job's dudes cry watching trump </v>

110
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:36.740
<v Speaker 1>on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The message is clear.</v>

111
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.723
<v Speaker 1>Heidi represents the white working class</v>
<v Speaker 1>voter who is struggling to accept that </v>

112
00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:41.654
<v Speaker 1>banking on trump was a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a glimmer of hope appears for both </v>

113
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Heidi and the Republican leadership </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectively.</v>

114
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>A healthy relationship with kyle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>garrison's dismal poll numbers.</v>

115
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll republican leaders and high he be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to escape their cycles of abuse,</v>

116
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>not so as garrison says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

117
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.684
<v Speaker 1>I know something about societal </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology that you three turd balls </v>

118
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's gonna be fine.</v>

119
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>What is garrison talking about first to </v>
<v Speaker 1>preface,</v>

120
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>something unique about South Park is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuanced way it critiques liberals.</v>

121
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Whereas due to the general liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of Hollywood,</v>

122
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>most satirical shows tend to mock </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

123
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.043
<v Speaker 1>That trend has been particularly true in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past year when snl and others </v>

124
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
<v Speaker 1>doubled down on trump theme lampoon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course these shows are unlikely to </v>

125
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>resonate with even a vaguely regretful </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump voter.</v>

126
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.533
<v Speaker 1>This climate is part of what has made </v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Trey reluctant to constantly </v>

127
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>take easy shots at trump or his </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters this season,</v>

128
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.763
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to the dinner with Heidi</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her pouch who bombard her with an </v>

129
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>array of smug jokes about cartman's </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism and sociopathic tendencies.</v>

130
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately all these antiques do is put </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi on the defensive,</v>

131
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.443
<v Speaker 1>making her feel stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Trey seem to be critiquing the </v>

132
00:06:54.271 --> 00:06:58.500
<v Speaker 1>way Hollywood has essentially declared </v>
<v Speaker 1>open season on trump and his supporters.</v>

133
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.633
<v Speaker 1>This is most clearly expressed through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle will often acts as the metal voice </v>

134
00:07:02.941 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 1>of reason for the show.</v>

135
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 2>You guys shouldn't criticize her so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>for going with carton.</v>

136
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.503
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in Kirby's non verbal person </v>

137
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 2>trust yet he carved as much as any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

138
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 2>but just give her some space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

139
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep saying we told you sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because if you make her feel dumb,</v>

140
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.520
<v Speaker 2>she just doubles down and tries to prove</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards south and it wasn't done.</v>

141
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Here are the show</v>

142
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>professors unambiguous disdain for </v>
<v Speaker 1>trunk,</v>

143
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.263
<v Speaker 1>but seems to be urging the liberal media</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be less condescending toward trump </v>

144
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less eager to feel smug and say,</v>

145
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:30.254
<v Speaker 1>I told you so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girls should have heated kyle's </v>

146
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:33.104
<v Speaker 1>warning because their comments during </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner made Heidi run right back to </v>

147
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>carbon.</v>

148
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.473
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe I am just stupid and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what I want and it ends up </v>

149
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 2>partying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

150
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know something.</v>

151
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.740
<v Speaker 2>None of this is your fault</v>

152
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.783
<v Speaker 1>at this moment and isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure Heidi is prime to believe </v>

153
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:52.624
<v Speaker 1>whatever radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigoted garbage carbon wants to serve </v>

154
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably like the voters she's come to</v>

155
00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:01.660
<v Speaker 1>represent and a surprisingly well </v>
<v Speaker 1>quaffed kyle is in for a surprise.</v>

156
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.643
<v Speaker 1>Just as trump has convinced his base to </v>
<v Speaker 1>blame the left for everything that goes </v>

157
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:06.574
<v Speaker 1>wrong with his presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carmen is convinced Heidi to make kyle </v>

158
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:11.940
<v Speaker 1>her well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish scape goat.</v>

159
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how you were raised,</v>

160
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 2>what you were tying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My heritage is Irish,</v>

161
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 2>so I'm prone to being moody and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>heritage.</v>

162
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a little sneaky sometimes and</v>

163
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>not even realize it.</v>

164
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Now a word on this episode's treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of antisemitism.</v>

165
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jew jokes have been carbons,</v>

166
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:32.380
<v Speaker 1>bread and butter since before Kenny's </v>
<v Speaker 1>first death.</v>

167
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

168
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.163
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

169
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you'll have that by got Kobe fat.</v>

170
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.283
<v Speaker 1>This episode felt a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardy's final speech to kyle is pretty </v>

171
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:42.214
<v Speaker 1>shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not loaded with the usual overt </v>

172
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:44.884
<v Speaker 1>punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we get is kyle looking pretty </v>

173
00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:47.884
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

174
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did she just call me a dirty Jew?</v>

175
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.330
<v Speaker 2>South Park's mockery of antisemites has </v>
<v Speaker 2>never looked so dark,</v>

176
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>which may be the shows way</v>

177
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 1>of acknowledging how fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different Hartman's character sounds </v>

178
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:00.354
<v Speaker 1>since the rise of the alt right has </v>
<v Speaker 1>southpark consciously graduated from </v>

179
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.553
<v Speaker 1>goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>childish bigotry to genuinely ugly </v>

180
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it.</v>

181
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>In the meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are worse than ever.</v>

182
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.813
<v Speaker 1>Heidi is now completely controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartman and the Republicans and the </v>

183
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>nation are going to get with an even </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger strap on.</v>

184
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Things are looking pretty bleak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you guys think?</v>

185
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.313
<v Speaker 1>We'll regretful trump voters be shamed </v>
<v Speaker 1>right back into his voting base or even </v>

186
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any hope for Heidi Paul Ryan or</v>
