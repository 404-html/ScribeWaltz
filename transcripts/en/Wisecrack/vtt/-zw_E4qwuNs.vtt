1
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here in the flesh this time,</v>

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.043
<v Speaker 1>you guys may or may not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why Scott conditions take a really </v>

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.134
<v Speaker 1>long time and we've been wanting to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something where we can quickly react to </v>

4
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>what's currently on TV or in theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

5
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>because we try it out with season three </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rick and morty and hey,</v>

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>if you like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us know.</v>

7
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to do these on things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones,</v>

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>stranger things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever this Jake Paul Person Is,</v>

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.493
<v Speaker 1>you name it in Rick Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stone we see rick summer and morty </v>

10
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>traversing a Mad Max inspired post </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse.</v>

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.913
<v Speaker 1>What struck me most about this episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an idea that has popped up in </v>

12
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:35.364
<v Speaker 1>previous episodes but hasn't been as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleshed out as fan favorites like </v>

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.323
<v Speaker 1>existences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and everything you believe his </v>

14
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>bullshit scientifically traditions or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot thing.</v>

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>That idea modern alienation through </v>
<v Speaker 1>April,</v>

16
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Glowing Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mustachioed murderer and Jerry,</v>

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.143
<v Speaker 1>the episode explores another depressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is guiding that society may be slowly </v>

19
00:00:58.621 --> 00:00:59.454
<v Speaker 1>destroying our soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on </v>

20
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.084
<v Speaker 1>rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing the stone and of course </v>

21
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first a quick recap.</v>

22
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.063
<v Speaker 1>Rick Morty in summer infiltrate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aptly named death stalkers to steal a </v>

23
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>glowing rock that rick wants for science</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 and summer.</v>

24
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.343
<v Speaker 1>Use this aggressive world to vent all </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're confused emotions about their </v>

25
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:18.804
<v Speaker 1>parents' divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Summer does all kinds of acting out and </v>

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.883
<v Speaker 1>then falls for a swole dude with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket on his head and eventually goes </v>

27
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>through her own divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There he is,</v>

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.073
<v Speaker 1>there's the nihilistic brute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I married allowing her to contextualize </v>

29
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>her parents' separation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morty fences,</v>

30
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.623
<v Speaker 1>frustration by living vicariously </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a revenge driven arm and </v>

31
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>eventually realizes he should just let </v>
<v Speaker 1>it go.</v>

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.593
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the lesson we've learned is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's our parents marriage </v>

33
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>glowing green rock or an awesome giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

34
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later you've got to let it go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rick acts like a child,</v>

35
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.823
<v Speaker 1>kind of my daughter's going through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce and I am not dealing with it in </v>

36
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>a healthy way at all.</v>

37
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Early in the episode we hear Rick </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced the idea of alienation,</v>

38
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you're really that alienated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm as willing to exploit it as the next</v>

39
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Guy Church army or Olympic gymnastics </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer suggesting that summer's tension</v>

40
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.054
<v Speaker 1>with Jerry has made her disillusioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing that can make her </v>

41
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>feel alive is to travel to a place where</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization has crumbled.</v>

42
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.493
<v Speaker 1>Now the cover thing here is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show not only tackles alienation on a </v>

43
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>micro level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family kind that summer and morty </v>

44
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.364
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on a macro level be alienation of </v>

45
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.274
<v Speaker 1>society as a whole and through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show frames how we lose agency in </v>

46
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>our everyday lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hasten point,</v>

47
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.573
<v Speaker 1>Sherry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this quote informs a lot of </v>

48
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in this episode to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to risk it off.</v>

49
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.033
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're just in a NERC chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly assembled molecules drifting </v>

50
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>wherever the universe blows you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

51
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see you there.</v>

52
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>How much of that did you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What rick is not so subtly suggesting is</v>

53
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Jerry's complete and utter lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal resolve,</v>

54
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>power agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

55
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>he's a doormat to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea of powerlessness informs a lot</v>

56
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:55.944
<v Speaker 1>of mortise resentment towards Jerry as </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidenced by this group standing in the </v>

57
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>driveway talking about custody and </v>
<v Speaker 1>either Kelly or you want to stay married</v>

58
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>or get on with your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you do,</v>

59
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>stop being a baby.</v>

60
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if dad really wanted to be here,</v>

61
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 2>he'd stop at nothing to make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

62
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe dad just doesn't want you back.</v>

63
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he just doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength to fight.</v>

64
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And in either case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got his life,</v>

65
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I got mine.</v>

66
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.440
<v Speaker 1>But mortise bitterness goes much further</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Jerry's failed marriage.</v>

67
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.393
<v Speaker 1>And that's because in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerry is the every man of the modern </v>

68
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:30.084
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the days of the industrial </v>

69
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:32.004
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been complaining about loss </v>

70
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.470
<v Speaker 1>of control in the modern world instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of having our own trade or farm,</v>

71
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:42.210
<v Speaker 1>many toil away at monotonous jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This loss of autonomy is reflected on by</v>

72
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>countless authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars,</v>

73
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:44.814
<v Speaker 1>and films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we might as well just throw this </v>

74
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>example at you.</v>

75
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.630
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>y'all need some attention.</v>

76
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's flown.</v>

77
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 3>God dammit and entire generation pumping</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas waiting tables.</v>

78
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.863
<v Speaker 3>Slaves with white cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Advertising has is chasing cars and </v>

79
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working jobs we hate so we can buy.</v>

80
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 3>We don't need the middle children of </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

81
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:08.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No purpose in place</v>

82
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is what frames mortise anger at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry's powerlessness.</v>

83
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Jerry is the pinnacle of modern stew </v>
<v Speaker 1>jury.</v>

84
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.043
<v Speaker 1>His existence as a cog in a meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine is really driven home in the </v>

85
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Rick Shank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Redemption or the Galactic Federation </v>

86
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:22.434
<v Speaker 1>keeps everyone compliant and docile </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a liberal use of </v>

87
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:26.274
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Galactic Federation taking over </v>

88
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Earth's best thing that's ever happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his family.</v>

89
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I just got my six promotion this week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still don't know what I do.</v>

90
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerry is so bad at being a person.</v>

91
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>He thrives in a society devoid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

92
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.473
<v Speaker 1>Summer show your father some respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling down a six chewable figure </v>

93
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:43.554
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His inability to assert himself is put </v>

94
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>on display in every interaction he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>with rick.</v>

95
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.033
<v Speaker 1>Of course there is a version of Jerry </v>
<v Speaker 1>who isn't in Rick's words and a nerd </v>

96
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:54.204
<v Speaker 1>chunk of randomly assembled molecules </v>
<v Speaker 1>drifting wherever the universe bloats </v>

97
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.863
<v Speaker 1>and that would be jerry from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cronenberg's when stripped of the </v>

98
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:00.954
<v Speaker 1>trappings of modern society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carey goes from being a useless hack in </v>

99
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:04.764
<v Speaker 1>a loveless marriage to a total badass </v>
<v Speaker 1>who seems to be keeping his marriage </v>

100
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

101
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.790
<v Speaker 1>This in itself is hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with this latest episode,</v>

102
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.653
<v Speaker 1>I think Rick and more use playing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that the trappings of modern </v>

103
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:20.120
<v Speaker 1>society are inherently alienating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>create Jerry's out of all of us.</v>

104
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.830
<v Speaker 1>After rick introduces electricity to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasteland,</v>

105
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>it's soon resembles a modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialized society.</v>

106
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Summers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent lifestyle has been traded in for</v>

107
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:31.800
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banalities she is an out murdering ubs.</v>

108
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.673
<v Speaker 1>She's grocery shopping for human bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The savagery of the death stalkers has </v>

109
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 1>been reduced to complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 1>recycling and hemorrhage.</v>

110
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 1>The murdering machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what good for nothing.</v>

111
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.174
<v Speaker 1>Couch potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't moved since I left to </v>

112
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 1>scavenge this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's so clever here is the implication</v>

113
00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:50.640
<v Speaker 1>that modern comforts are what drive our </v>
<v Speaker 1>banal,</v>

114
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:51.474
<v Speaker 1>terrible lives with no mutans to fend </v>
<v Speaker 1>off people resort to bickering about </v>

115
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>trivialities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We noticed that you've been put in scrap</v>

116
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.150
<v Speaker 1>metal in the boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

117
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.203
<v Speaker 1>Due to electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People aren't murdering each other in </v>

118
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>the blood dome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're watching blood doe see most post</v>

119
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.444
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic fiction functions as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautionary tale of how awful our lives </v>

120
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>might become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>

121
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:14.774
<v Speaker 1>being the darkest show on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty goes out of its way to </v>

122
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>prove that modern life is its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>special brand of soul.</v>

123
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 1>Crushing our comforts eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienate us from meaning creating </v>

124
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.633
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or as Rick says about ruining summer's </v>

125
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:28.994
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grandpa just sped things up with a few </v>

126
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>creature comforts of modern society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an interesting question that's</v>

127
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>a bit speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the summer,</v>

128
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:37.214
<v Speaker 1>forgive her father because she sees that</v>
<v Speaker 1>modernization turns every man into an </v>

129
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:41.894
<v Speaker 1>action list slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a post apocalyptic </v>

130
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.883
<v Speaker 1>badass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to speculate a little bit </v>

131
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>about Jerry here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's likely that rick will stay the same</v>

132
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 1>old uncaring ass he's ever been.</v>

133
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>But I think we're gonna see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>character growth in his family members.</v>

134
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry,</v>

135
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>what if he has a tyler durden moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Cronenberg Sherry?</v>

136
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.943
<v Speaker 1>What if he liked Edward Norton goes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a disaffected modern buffoon to a </v>

137
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>man of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the show has countless references</v>

138
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:08.804
<v Speaker 1>to popular cinema and I think a fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>club shout out would work perfect for </v>

139
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Jerry's season three arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

140
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're just going to have to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>as season three continues.</v>
