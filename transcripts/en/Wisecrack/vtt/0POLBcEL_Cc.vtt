<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>do I think that there will be newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women's?</v>

3
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

4
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that the New York Times will </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive the Internet.</v>

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their traffic is unbelievable striking.</v>

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I think most cities in Israel as </v>

7
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not sure.</v>

8
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:25.604
<v Speaker 1>They're only hope and their aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So says the big man at the top of the </v>

9
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.883
<v Speaker 1>boards is to go local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even the Los Angeles Times is being </v>

10
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>pressured to become a local newspaper in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a larger sense of what local is in La.</v>

11
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.003
<v Speaker 1>So there are very few truly national </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers left and foreign bureaus are by </v>

12
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the gear are being cut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.303
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problem is I understood as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that the newspapers face is that </v>

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.653
<v Speaker 1>websites like google glean off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>content from a newspaper without the </v>

15
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>revenue from that content going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper.</v>

16
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>google hat makes revenue from these ads,</v>

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>but they get the content for vr </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually for free.</v>

18
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a whole generation,</v>

19
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>my generation and younger who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to expect print news for free.</v>

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.973
<v Speaker 1>They were up in arms because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being asked to pay $50 a year for the </v>

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>New York Times Tacan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I find,</v>

22
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd that they would be so aghast over</v>

23
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:20.624
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think newspapers are in trouble.</v>

25
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible time to be a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

26
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>There's less jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less demand in,</v>

27
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the American public for international</v>

28
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.763
<v Speaker 1>news and there's less demand clearly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our less desire among people to pay for </v>

29
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>their news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I don't think it's a good time.</v>
