00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.080
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>skillshare.</v>

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>a wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared,</v>

4
00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

5
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is obsessed with fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>life analysts was wrong.</v>

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Wife analysts was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The philosophy of Santos,</v>

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

8
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.403
<v Speaker 1>Even showed up in fortnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but aside from infinity war grossing </v>

9
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>more money than the entire GDP of Belize</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Josh Brolin being a bad ass.</v>

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Why is this fill in the most ubiquitous </v>
<v Speaker 1>since this dude,</v>

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.193
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all diabolic plans get this much </v>

12
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>internet debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell,</v>

13
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:37.444
<v Speaker 1>let's just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always do hijacks Jackson nuclear </v>

14
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 1>weapons and hold the world hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>after a classic wisecrack brainstorm </v>
<v Speaker 1>session,</v>

16
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I eat unsafe amounts of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've come up with a possible answer.</v>

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>It all has to do with the transition </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this to this nanos.</v>

18
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.703
<v Speaker 1>Welcome Liz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wise crack edition on this very </v>

19
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>distinguished Chin and spoilers for </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity war and the comics ahead.</v>

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that the 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pianos isn't to fan,</v>

21
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>knows has always been a comic book fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was was created by Jim Starlin in 1973</v>

22
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>and issue number 55 of the invincible </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironman,</v>

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>and he immediately became a hit with </v>
<v Speaker 1>readers in part due to.</v>

24
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outright weirdness of his cars.</v>

25
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.993
<v Speaker 1>You see everything comic book Fan Ost </v>
<v Speaker 1>did he did to impress the object of his </v>

26
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>affection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marvel's personification of death,</v>

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.073
<v Speaker 1>who appears as a robed female skeleton </v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't really talk a lot and </v>

28
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just not into him,</v>

29
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.230
<v Speaker 1>but maybe if he defeats one more </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure or conquers one more planet.</v>

30
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So you're telling me there's a chance.</v>

31
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his later counterpart Comic Book </v>

32
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Vanos is definitely a product of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

33
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.543
<v Speaker 1>America in the late sixties and early </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies seemed to be infused with </v>

34
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr</v>

35
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>were slain in 68,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 1968 and 1972 over a hundred and</v>

36
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:00.094
<v Speaker 1>30 American commercial airplanes were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hijacked with many of these hijackings </v>

37
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>ending in fatalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By 1973 over 58,000</v>

38
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>American soldiers had died in Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had infested our culture.</v>

39
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Why not have a super villain lust after </v>
<v Speaker 1>her?</v>

40
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not the first time art has lusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>after death in many ways.</v>

41
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:20.914
<v Speaker 1>Comic Book Vanos with his obsessive form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Necrophilia hearkens back to an </v>

42
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.163
<v Speaker 1>earlier time when obsessions like his </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all the rage he fits right in with </v>

43
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the capital are romantics of the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

44
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.113
<v Speaker 1>The poets like Lord Byron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Keats and Percy shelley depth was </v>

45
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>nature at its most glorious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphant,</v>

46
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.043
<v Speaker 1>keats himself and used on being half in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love with death and it's no surprise </v>

47
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that the greatest American poet from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this era is Edgar Allen Poe,</v>

48
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.963
<v Speaker 1>the man who invented the spirit of hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic hundreds of years before it </v>

49
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself in every mall across </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

50
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And in this vein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comic Book Fan.</v>

51
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:56.674
<v Speaker 1>Osu is a romantic 100 percent angsty </v>
<v Speaker 1>banjos once the whole universe to feel </v>

52
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.064
<v Speaker 1>his pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if comic book Fan Ost Living His </v>

53
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.034
<v Speaker 1>passion driven emo life dovetailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely with be so full sleep heart at </v>

54
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would he fair?</v>

55
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.004
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while today's America certainly has its </v>

56
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>own boogeyman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death isn't really one of them.</v>

57
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Sure there's terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fears of the information age are</v>

58
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>more analytical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more driven by endless streams of data,</v>

59
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>whether it be 24 hour news cycles or 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our social media feeds,</v>

60
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.403
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking about it gives me a panic </v>

61
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.300
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So marvel had to augment Thanos.</v>

62
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.233
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to tinker with primary </v>

63
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep him in obsessive lunatic,</v>

64
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.853
<v Speaker 1>but changes obsession from death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so retro to data retain his </v>

65
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>distinctive costume and appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Even keep the tire tracks on that sexy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinet,</v>

67
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.633
<v Speaker 1>his Butler bottom eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the fields cinematic banjos in </v>

68
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>contrast to his four color antecedent is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not impulsive at all.</v>

69
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>He rarely even raises his voice as </v>
<v Speaker 1>befitting to our era.</v>

70
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.553
<v Speaker 1>Cinematic Banjos is a rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically rationalism first rose to </v>

71
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>prominence during the 17th and 18th </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

72
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.713
<v Speaker 1>This is Galileo pushing back at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>church about the movement of the earth </v>

73
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Newton deducing,</v>

74
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the three laws of classical mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pascal,</v>

75
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>furthering our understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry,</v>

76
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the salient furthering our understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human anatomy.</v>

77
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It's descartes proclaiming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am not.</v>

78
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:25.504
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think these are the men and women </v>

79
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>who pushed against all emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction in order to achieve a higher</v>

80
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.004
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Berlin goes about his business with </v>

81
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:36.064
<v Speaker 1>the detachment of a rationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It explains how he's able to murder his </v>

82
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.263
<v Speaker 1>own daughter for the sake of achieving </v>
<v Speaker 1>his utilitarian solution to </v>

83
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>erases every other man,</v>

84
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child from existence,</v>

85
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>and justifies it to cold logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why this change?</v>

86
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a sign of the times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:55.234
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a second reason to </v>

88
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:57.874
<v Speaker 1>highlight the flaws of Tony Stark in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminal work on literary criticism </v>

89
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:03.484
<v Speaker 1>poetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle claims that effective </v>

90
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>antagonists act not only in opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hero,</v>

91
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>but also reflect a vital flawed aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hero.</v>

92
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.593
<v Speaker 1>This is the literary theory of foils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamlet's self righteousness is so </v>

93
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>complete that it compels him to deceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kill,</v>

94
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but the same could be said of his enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Claudius,</v>

95
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.543
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

96
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.883
<v Speaker 1>you killed my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absent Fathers Syndrome leads both Luke </v>

97
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:33.334
<v Speaker 1>skywalker and Darth vader to make some </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad decisions and Sour Mon is </v>

98
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>little more than Gandalf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen from grace.</v>

99
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And so when we apply poetics to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avengers,</v>

100
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:43.654
<v Speaker 1>infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

101
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.493
<v Speaker 1>we discover why big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad thing I was had to be a rationalist </v>

102
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>because our protagonist Tony Stark is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one to granted.</v>

103
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark has his moments of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtaken with emotion.</v>

104
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>He begins his first movie as a carefree </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich boy arms dealer.</v>

105
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Later events shake him out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort zone.</v>

106
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.783
<v Speaker 1>So much so that by iron man three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so overcome with the emotional </v>

107
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of a near death experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's more or less crippled.</v>

108
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.403
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ping pongs back to the security of </v>

109
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.014
<v Speaker 1>stubborn rational thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's in this headspace that he </v>

110
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>creates ultron and advocates for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sokovia accords documents like that.</v>

111
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Documents which exists solely to enforce</v>
<v Speaker 1>order or rationalist best friend,</v>

112
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to infinity war.</v>

113
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Remember Tony Solution to defeating </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanos?</v>

114
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>He's going to secure Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange if he can keep the analysts from</v>

115
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:31.724
<v Speaker 1>acquiring the time stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinity gauntlet can't be </v>

116
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:34.604
<v Speaker 1>completed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so mathematical that even Sheldon </v>

117
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Cooper would have no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

118
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more big bang theory jokes.</v>

119
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It's an elegant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical strategy.</v>

120
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It is rational and it fails utterly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it does.</v>

121
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.173
<v Speaker 1>A need for rational solutions is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vital flawed characteristic that Tony </v>

122
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:51.434
<v Speaker 1>has in common with Vanos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotelian storytelling demands that </v>

123
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Tony Fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>

124
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if Tony Stark is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>character in the movie.</v>

125
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.763
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one could argue that the true beating </v>

126
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>heart of the mcu belongs instead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>captain America himself.</v>

127
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.613
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it Steve's emotional fortitude which </v>

128
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>finally brings the avengers together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rescues the winter soldier from darkness</v>

129
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and denies the confines of the Sokovia </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corps.</v>

130
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rogers is marvel's capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our romantic hero is driven by loyalty,</v>

131
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his own principles,</v>

132
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>romanticism versus rationalism.</v>

133
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>It's this age old duality which forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>the core of the Tony Stark,</v>

134
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antagonism from the moment they meet,</v>

135
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it forms the foundation of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate attempts to stop vanos stark.</v>

136
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:36.944
<v Speaker 1>The rationalist tries to out strategize </v>
<v Speaker 1>him while Roger's the romantic tries to </v>

137
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.700
<v Speaker 1>beat him up with an army and they both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that they both fail,</v>

138
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:47.414
<v Speaker 1>that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the only way they can come up </v>

139
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>with to solve a complicated problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>two diametrically opposed worldviews,</v>

140
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or romanticism.</v>

141
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.613
<v Speaker 1>Having to choose between two extremes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a defining characteristic of infinity </v>

142
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The avengers can either a,</v>

143
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.273
<v Speaker 1>let vision live and risk vanos getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the milestone or be killed her best </v>

144
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>friend and stop Nanos or look at Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>strangest dilemma.</v>

145
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.253
<v Speaker 1>He can either let Tony Stark die and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps defeat pianos or give it up and </v>

146
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.694
<v Speaker 1>save Tony and let half the world die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to use the time stone as a way </v>

147
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.160
<v Speaker 1>to defeat nanosecond.</v>

148
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.093
<v Speaker 1>After exploring 14 million options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only find success once one in 14 </v>

149
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

150
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Strange then gives up the time stone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>save stark.</v>

151
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.873
<v Speaker 1>Now we can assume that this rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice that strange makes is necessary </v>

152
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:36.104
<v Speaker 1>toward that one in 14 million success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now it sure looks awful </v>

153
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:40.424
<v Speaker 1>because it allows our villain to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>being stuck between option a and option </v>

154
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>B is stenosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whole Shtick,</v>

155
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.953
<v Speaker 1>a man who literally control space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>time can somehow only think of two </v>

156
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>outcomes in response to dwindling </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

157
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Let overpopulation run its course </v>
<v Speaker 1>through war,</v>

158
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and misery,</v>

159
00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.273
<v Speaker 1>or kill half the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't just snap his fingers to </v>

160
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>make more food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources or even planets to live on,</v>

161
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.603
<v Speaker 1>but as a reflection of modern society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly the point and perhaps </v>

162
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:14.451
<v Speaker 1>why fantas resonates so much in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Maggie asked her recently observed in</v>

163
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our life expectancy is declined.</v>

164
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Suicide rates have risen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opioid crisis has worsened.</v>

165
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Inequality has grown in confidence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has fallen when confronted </v>

166
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 1>with the enormous problems of our modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

167
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.703
<v Speaker 1>It seems like every choice is damned if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do damned if you don't work a job </v>

168
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>that pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be miserable or work a job you love.</v>

169
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.993
<v Speaker 1>Be Poor and miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vote for a Douche or vote for a Turd </v>

170
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like in many facets of life,</v>

171
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>we're given the options of Pepsi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coke,</v>

172
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>but no RC cola Bago boil on Fox and park</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Moxie,</v>

173
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.433
<v Speaker 1>and that's the problem with Dan knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a political imagination is </v>

174
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.250
<v Speaker 1>so limited and you only have a choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two things.</v>

175
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 1>All the rationality and the world isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to help you make progress.</v>

176
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 1>In order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need more imagination.</v>

177
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.533
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

178
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.243
<v Speaker 1>and what our political imagination is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she will never experience the joy of </v>

179
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:11.564
<v Speaker 1>Phaco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any escape Hegel road that </v>

180
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes in history the way forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>

181
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.163
<v Speaker 1>so when we take two diametrically </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed things and synthesize them into </v>

182
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:21.374
<v Speaker 1>a fresh approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is probably what lays before us in </v>

183
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:24.744
<v Speaker 1>avengers four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is probably how our heroes will </v>

184
00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:29.960
<v Speaker 1>ultimately defeat banjos and saved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe as they say.</v>

185
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.590
<v Speaker 1>When the old tricks fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to come up with new tricks.</v>

186
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.880
