<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Skillshare,</v>

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>a wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared,</v>

3
00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you one of the million spending your</v>

4
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:10.784
<v Speaker 1>evenings as a digital dark elf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shotgunning strangers in the world's </v>

5
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>most popular video game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if not,</v>

6
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.184
<v Speaker 1>are you wondering why everyone won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up about the fluorescent cartoon </v>

7
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>version of Pub g?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're a fortnight fan or not,</v>

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.123
<v Speaker 1>you might have a more pressing question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell was this free game making </v>

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think you know the answer,</v>

10
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>but here's something you might not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered for night,</v>

11
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't making money in spite of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's free.</v>

12
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It's making money because it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.453
<v Speaker 1>it's stupendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success might aluminate one of the </v>

14
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>fundamental tenants of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.793
<v Speaker 1>so climb off your Air Force One and </v>
<v Speaker 1>button up your virtual bridges as we </v>

16
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:45.914
<v Speaker 1>break down the economics of fortnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you living under a </v>

17
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:49.664
<v Speaker 1>pixelated rock fortnight is a battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>royale style shooter where you hunger </v>

18
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>games or weighted the finale in hopes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the last cat standing.</v>

19
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You can also play in squads or 50 slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>

20
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.343
<v Speaker 1>It sets itself apart from the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle royale games with it's more </v>

21
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>colorful and cartoonish style and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to build things like a murderous</v>

22
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>minecraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

23
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>and also everything is free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game is free to download.</v>

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>The weapons are free and you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>need an inexpensive console.</v>

25
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.014
<v Speaker 1>Since you can play online on a potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This essentially makes the game </v>

26
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>available to everyone with access to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.313
<v Speaker 1>but fortnights producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epic games is making staggering amounts </v>

28
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In May of this year alone,</v>

29
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.523
<v Speaker 1>they made $318,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough for Elon musk to launch </v>

30
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>five rockets to space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

31
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly fortnight,</v>

32
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>makes its money on in game purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's in game currency vbox.</v>

33
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>We're going to assume the V stands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual,</v>

34
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>not vapid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacant or vacuous because what does this</v>

35
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:48.824
<v Speaker 1>virtual cash gets you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad ass weaponry to slay your foes or </v>

36
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>super powerful armor to protect you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad men trying to teabag you.</v>

37
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

38
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:57.284
<v Speaker 1>You can buy dances and shiny things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>functionless armor and different </v>

39
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

40
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you can buy all the bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly or individualized you want,</v>

41
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.823
<v Speaker 1>but it's all purely cosmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know lots of games manipulate us </v>

42
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>into buying things.</v>

43
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 2>It pays the payer with a skimper game </v>
<v Speaker 2>loop.</v>

44
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.763
<v Speaker 2>Use Lots of flashing into things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>condiments to make the player feel good </v>

45
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:17.794
<v Speaker 2>about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Train the players to spend your </v>

46
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.853
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Offer the payers away to spend real </v>

47
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:23.344
<v Speaker 2>currency for your picker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they'll forget that are spending </v>

48
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 2>money and make the game about waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let the player base,</v>

49
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.523
<v Speaker 2>not the wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a surefire way to make lots of </v>

50
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

51
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
<v Speaker 1>That's not news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fortnight is different than other </v>

52
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:35.494
<v Speaker 1>free to play games where you can buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that actually you know helps you </v>

53
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.633
<v Speaker 1>in those games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free to play is essentially paid when </v>

54
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.013
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait 20 hours for your fortress to </v>

55
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:44.914
<v Speaker 1>upgrade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can speed it up for ninety nine </v>

56
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 1>cents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fortnight insists on equal access to</v>

57
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>all players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you suck,</v>

58
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

59
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 2>this is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is better than another.</v>

60
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

61
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.330
<v Speaker 1>making sure that none of the purchases </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually give you any advantage,</v>

62
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.760
<v Speaker 1>which even if you hate the game is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty cool,</v>

63
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>so why do people buy this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only function is cosmetic,</v>

64
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.460
<v Speaker 1>but we all just idiots trying real hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn reality into an episode of Black</v>

65
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.911
<v Speaker 1>Mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:18.744
<v Speaker 1>laugh all you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our fortnights show boaters are </v>

67
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 1>actually just doing something that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all do,</v>

68
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.273
<v Speaker 1>whether we like to admit it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically just the logic on which </v>

69
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.503
<v Speaker 1>our whole economy is built to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people want to spend their money on </v>

70
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>books just to spend those bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pick that's shaped like a baseball</v>

71
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:35.874
<v Speaker 1>bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to hop on a battle bus and </v>

72
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:39.470
<v Speaker 1>transport ourselves to the year 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>

73
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.523
<v Speaker 1>Back then most economists were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how the markets worked based </v>

74
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 1>on how useful goods were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much labor went into making them,</v>

75
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and of course the supply and demand of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those items.</v>

76
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Economists essentially believed people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would rationally ordered their purchases</v>

77
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:53.514
<v Speaker 1>based on need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You buy bread because it feeds you </v>

78
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>coats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they keep you warm at second,</v>

79
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.793
<v Speaker 1>but then they looked at how the wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>were spending their money and thought </v>

80
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.943
<v Speaker 1>what it turns out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were buying the 19th century </v>

81
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:05.334
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of bunny brawler or ginger </v>
<v Speaker 1>gunner skins except probably filthy </v>

82
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:10.134
<v Speaker 1>engaged you smallpox or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then along came economist and </v>

83
00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>sociologist Thorstein veblen tomato </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>

84
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>That might seem obvious today for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Veblen.</v>

85
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:19.704
<v Speaker 1>You can explain these irrational </v>
<v Speaker 1>purchases by recognizing that people </v>

86
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:23.664
<v Speaker 1>don't just purchase for utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also purchase basically just to be </v>

87
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:27.804
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might call this the snob factor and </v>

88
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:31.530
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he gave it a different name.</v>

89
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.573
<v Speaker 1>Conspicuous consumption Bebo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and recognize that people purchased </v>

90
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:36.414
<v Speaker 1>certain goods and services in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly flex their wealth and what did </v>

91
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>veblen observed the wealthy doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show us their Mad Moolah?</v>

92
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>The ceremonial differentiation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary basically really,</v>

93
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 1>really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boone's along with servants,</v>

94
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:51.474
<v Speaker 1>huge houses and cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the poor had to get by on bread and </v>

95
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:55.134
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to consume and even waste </v>

96
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>set the wealthy apart because what says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm special more than literally throwing</v>

97
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:05.880
<v Speaker 1>or drinking away your cash or in a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical sense,</v>

98
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 1>stealing your mom's credit card to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of dollars on viva.</v>

99
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 3>You have spent a bunch of panels on </v>
<v Speaker 3>playstation.</v>

100
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you have done this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

101
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 3>you've done this before.</v>

102
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.703
<v Speaker 1>Without this conspicuous consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our modern economies might not even </v>

103
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.300
<v Speaker 1>exist if the economy just fed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothed us,</v>

104
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.183
<v Speaker 1>housed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gave us medical care and all the </v>

105
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.484
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy would grind to a halt for </v>

106
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>companies that always need to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>their profits.</v>

107
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>How do you squeeze a few more dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a coat?</v>

108
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you slap a designer's name on it or you </v>

109
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:38.344
<v Speaker 1>jack up the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To attract those obsessed with status </v>

110
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.183
<v Speaker 1>fortnight is maybe one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive examples of the digitization </v>

111
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>of conspicuous consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can set yourself apart.</v>

112
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Irl is you spend hundreds of hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing video games.</v>

113
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can see your sweet cakes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>vineyard bind swag and when all eyes are</v>

114
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've made it to the last two,</v>

115
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.663
<v Speaker 1>don't you want to leave an impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for night does more than just </v>

116
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>scratch a digital age for behavior.</v>

117
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.913
<v Speaker 1>We see everywhere around us in fashion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cars and houses because it takes </v>

118
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.560
<v Speaker 1>this idea of conspicuous consumption and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gamifies it.</v>

119
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.803
<v Speaker 1>Mobile Games have the benefit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive piles of data which allow them </v>

120
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.260
<v Speaker 1>to optimize your spending night </v>
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

121
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.103
<v Speaker 1>These techniques which are now common on</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecommerce sites and mobile games like </v>

122
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>limited time offers with countdown </v>
<v Speaker 1>clocks.</v>

123
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>That really reminds you how much you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>regret.</v>

124
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Not taking advantage of this deal in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next 13 hours,</v>

125
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but what sets fortnight apart is its </v>
<v Speaker 1>babbled pash structure.</v>

126
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a regular player,</v>

127
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 1>each season you can level up up to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times getting the occasional skin glider</v>

128
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.483
<v Speaker 1>tag or now toy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not every level and as you a </v>

129
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>free player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the seat.</v>

130
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four levels.</v>

131
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll look like the red skull crossed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with ne more the submariner,</v>

132
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but you'll also see side by side all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you're missing,</v>

133
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>vbox and XP bonuses and costumes.</v>

134
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.853
<v Speaker 1>You get the idea and at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a nice little reminder that if </v>

135
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you spend 10 bucks on the battle pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could unlock all these things you've</v>

136
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.323
<v Speaker 1>already earned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas some games might offer loot </v>

137
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:08.564
<v Speaker 1>boxes to manipulate you like a casino </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing you in with a dopamine hit from </v>

138
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the luck of the draw fortnight draws you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in with pure conspicuous consumption.</v>

139
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else with a series of ebooks is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have this emote.</v>

140
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you really want to be the lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>without it,</v>

141
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.173
<v Speaker 1>and of course you can earn vbox by </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the game and completing </v>

142
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:26.354
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that'll just take too much time and </v>

143
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.874
<v Speaker 1>set you apart as the poor kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might be thinking conspicuous </v>

144
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.560
<v Speaker 1>consumption is for the rich or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tay.</v>

145
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't even have a park.</v>

146
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>People dropping money on fortnite aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily loaded well for veblen.</v>

147
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:46.054
<v Speaker 1>Just because conspicuous consumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts with the rich doesn't mean it </v>

148
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.983
<v Speaker 1>ends there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the rich want to show how important </v>

149
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:52.804
<v Speaker 1>they are with the things they own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor want to escape the stigma of </v>

150
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>poverty by appearing rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once the poor have successfully</v>

151
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:00.364
<v Speaker 1>emulated the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rich need to buy more equally </v>

152
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:05.530
<v Speaker 1>useless things to again distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

153
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Veblen called this depressing cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic epn waving pecuniary emulation.</v>

154
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.170
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortnights battle pat system works a lot</v>

155
00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:17.710
<v Speaker 1>like fashion magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can afford to peruse the pages to</v>

156
00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:18.544
<v Speaker 1>see what high society is wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they can't afford the clothing </v>

157
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

158
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.973
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the point you want the audience as </v>

159
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:30.991
<v Speaker 1>large as possible so that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of well can spot your $50,000</v>

160
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.823
<v Speaker 1>and this is how fortnight makes money by</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing on our desire to meet at least </v>

161
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.460
<v Speaker 1>as cool but preferably cooler than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

162
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.563
<v Speaker 1>What better way to earn money than my </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a game free to everyone so that </v>

163
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.014
<v Speaker 1>nobody feels left out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then providing incentive for folks </v>

164
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:49.570
<v Speaker 1>to pay to demonstrate their awesomeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

165
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.750
<v Speaker 1>the game isn't making boucoup bucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that it's free.</v>

166
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's making money because it's free and </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it work?</v>

167
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.113
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at some stats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a survey of a thousand fortnight </v>

168
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.054
<v Speaker 1>players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>68 point eight percent had spent an </v>

169
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>average of $85 on the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the bids on cosmetic stuff.</v>

170
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.133
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's all about keeping up with </v>

171
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:09.564
<v Speaker 1>the Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's four nine really doing anything </v>

172
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>we don't already experienced in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>analog lives,</v>

173
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've just found the shiny new digital</v>

174
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>arena in which we all want to be liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and feel special,</v>

175
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>so free or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're totally by now.</v>

176
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Next time you need a break from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of slurp,</v>
