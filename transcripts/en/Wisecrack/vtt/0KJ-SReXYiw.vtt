1
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he essentially,</v>

2
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>his innovation was to recognize from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>start that the campaign is just really a</v>

3
00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>bad reality show and he made it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>a good reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not saying that qualitatively</v>

5
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>he was a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that he knew how to make</v>

6
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:20.014
<v Speaker 1>good television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew he knew how to attract the </v>

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entertainment.</v>

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.693
<v Speaker 1>the financial incentives of everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's on the bus or on the campaign </v>

10
00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:29.374
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the candidates who are funded </v>

11
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 1>a very small group of ultra powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial donors.</v>

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the press and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

14
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.770
<v Speaker 1>they're basically funded by advertising </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.633
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere along the line there was a </v>

16
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>synergy between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.643
<v Speaker 1>the person who was the most entertaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand and who was able to </v>

18
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>satisfy the donor class.</v>

19
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.353
<v Speaker 1>And the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find that sweet spot in the </v>

20
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.593
<v Speaker 1>middle of those two phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's usually where you were going to </v>

21
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.564
<v Speaker 1>get your candidate a is someone who is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit entertaining and also a </v>

22
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>little bit more flexible as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that at the,</v>

23
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>at the outset of the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was able to attract mountains and,</v>

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars,</v>

26
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>probably a free coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.833
<v Speaker 1>at a period of the race when other </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates have to buy their own </v>

28
00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:16.504
<v Speaker 1>publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he made it into a kind of a genuine </v>

29
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:19.504
<v Speaker 1>revolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a where his voters perceive themselves </v>

30
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:24.484
<v Speaker 1>as to kind of be aggrieved victims of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy of elites that were </v>

31
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>represented by all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the donors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press,</v>

33
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two parties.</v>

34
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And he managed to get past a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the bulwarks that we usually</v>

35
00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>had thrown up in the past to keep him.</v>

36
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 1>People like that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

37
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:41.284
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally when a candidate slips up and </v>

38
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>make some mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Howard Dean when he made his scream or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Hart when it got busted with the </v>

41
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>monkey business photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we typically used to descend upon a </v>

43
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.274
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reporter I know used to call it the </v>

44
00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>seal of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.801
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.634
<v Speaker 1>we would kind of swirl around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate with negative attention and </v>

47
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.200
<v Speaker 1>that would really be it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>a few hundred times and they would show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.780
<v Speaker 1>a damning clip and the person would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>exit the scene.</v>

50
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be humiliating public apology </v>

51
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:17.314
<v Speaker 1>and then a few a drop in the polls and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few weeks later you wouldn't hear from </v>

52
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that candidate again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen this time,</v>

53
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:23.134
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump managed to survive countless </v>

54
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>scandals like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time everybody expected him to</v>

55
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>go down in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went up in the polls.</v>

56
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our profession,</v>

57
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of flummoxed by that.</v>

58
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of defined the usual laws of</v>

59
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>gravity and we just didn't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do about it.</v>
