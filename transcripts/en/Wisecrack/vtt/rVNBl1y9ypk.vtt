<v Speaker 1>What's up everyone?</v>

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Disembodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared again,</v>

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.903
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DCEU has had a pretty rough go of </v>

6
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:15.204
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already broken down what went </v>

7
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>wrong in Batman v Superman and suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>squad,</v>

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but today we're going back to the source</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all these issues.</v>

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.733
<v Speaker 1>The movie that began Zack Snyder's </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of the DC universe that gave </v>

10
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>birth to mustache gape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tramp stamp,</v>

11
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>joker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Momoa,</v>

12
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>dead eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonder woman.</v>

13
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one was pretty great.</v>

14
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.843
<v Speaker 1>They never ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will they or won't they all ultimately </v>

15
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:35.514
<v Speaker 1>leading to the tragically bland </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate mandated void that is the </v>

16
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:39.534
<v Speaker 1>justice league.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But none of this would exist if it </v>

17
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.671
<v Speaker 1>weren't for the film that set the tone </v>
<v Speaker 1>man of steel by trying to graph darkness</v>

18
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>and grit onto a character devoid of such</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities,</v>

19
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>man of steel stumbles into a mess that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ultimately doom the DCEU.</v>

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.433
<v Speaker 1>So let's rotate the earth back half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade and see how the Dcu went so </v>

21
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So early.</v>

22
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wisecrack addition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>man of steel.</v>

23
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always spoilers ahead.</v>

24
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Back in 2013 DC films was riding high </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the critical and financial success</v>

25
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>of Christopher Nolan's dark knight </v>
<v Speaker 1>trilogy.</v>

26
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.273
<v Speaker 1>Those films successfully merge the pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic of a superhero film with a </v>

27
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>previously unmatched sense of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one explored.</v>

28
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.774
<v Speaker 1>The darker aspects of being the Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning whether the vigilante </v>

29
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:25.344
<v Speaker 1>himself was a destructive force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did Batman beak in the very cycle of </v>

30
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>violence he fights against with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joker,</v>

31
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.154
<v Speaker 1>Bain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the rest of these villains ever </v>

32
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>have come to fruition if he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

33
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>If true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what good is Batman are suppose it hero?</v>

34
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Is he a necessary evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are weighty questions to ask.</v>

35
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And yet the dark knight trilogy never </v>
<v Speaker 1>tipped over into pump hostility.</v>

36
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>The rare superhero films to be both </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart and entertaining.</v>

37
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.173
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise then that DC wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreate this same success with their </v>

38
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>other tentpole comic character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superman.</v>

39
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean those Christopher Nolan Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

40
00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.664
<v Speaker 1>Sure we're successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why not do the exact same thing for </v>

41
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>superman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a sure fire hit.</v>

42
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>What could go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the powers that be hired,</v>

43
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.404
<v Speaker 1>another dark and gritty filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchman in 300 Zack Snyder brought in </v>

44
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:11.694
<v Speaker 1>the co writer of the Dark Knight Trilogy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even gave our boy Nolan a story </v>

45
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>credit and producer role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just one little problem.</v>

46
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Superman isn't that feed darkness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight intrinsic to Batman and </v>

47
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>emotionally scarred vigilante avenging </v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of his parents just isn't true</v>

48
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>for Superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>

49
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Superman is supposed to be the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all powerful,</v>

50
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.413
<v Speaker 1>yet completely pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a malevolent bone in his </v>

51
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the ultimate good guy.</v>

52
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So how the hell do you impose darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grit,</v>

53
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and weight onto the symbol of hope on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

54
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It means hope for Snyder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer didn't lie with Superman,</v>

55
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.513
<v Speaker 1>but in the world around him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has changed a whole lot since </v>

56
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:54.714
<v Speaker 1>Superman's comic book introduction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1938 where once upon a time the good </v>

57
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>guys and bad guys were easy to deduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>and label.</v>

58
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man of steel was written.</v>

59
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>The endless war on terror had muddied </v>
<v Speaker 1>the waters,</v>

60
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>one ton of obey Sinophobia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficient veteran services.</v>

61
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.454
<v Speaker 1>Painting America as a far cry from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed shining city on a hill man of </v>

62
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Questions.</v>

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>If Superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of the American ideal can</v>

64
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>survive in the current disillusioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

65
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>will he be accepted or rejected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ostensibly,</v>

66
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a coming out story where this </v>
<v Speaker 1>central question becomes,</v>

67
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>should superman revealed himself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and lest anyone ever accused man</v>

68
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.714
<v Speaker 1>of steel of being subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Clark first discovers his powers </v>

69
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>during class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs away and hides out in,</v>

70
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you guessed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a closet.</v>

71
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.273
<v Speaker 1>So what answer does the film provide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should Superman remain in the closet or </v>

72
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>reveal his powers and save the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the hero he's always been?</v>

73
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer becomes far darker and </v>

74
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.254
<v Speaker 1>murkier than you'd expect after young </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark saves a bus full of students from </v>

75
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.604
<v Speaker 1>drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Kent tells him that maybe he </v>

76
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was I supposed to do?</v>

77
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.323
<v Speaker 2>Just let him die.</v>

78
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

79
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.673
<v Speaker 1>let that sink in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The All American dad tells the </v>

80
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:13.230
<v Speaker 1>burgeoning hero he should probably just </v>
<v Speaker 1>let a bunch of children drown.</v>

81
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 1>The crazier part man of steel treats us </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice as sound.</v>

82
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.783
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan in the same scene tells Clark </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's more at stake than the </v>

83
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>lives of a bunch of children in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world finds out what you can do.</v>

84
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It's going to change everything or</v>

85
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 2>our beliefs or our notions of what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means to be human.</v>

86
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.493
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

87
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan fears that when confronted with</v>
<v Speaker 1>WHO and what Clark is,</v>

88
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.640
<v Speaker 1>people will fear and reject him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humanities,</v>

89
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:41.570
<v Speaker 1>very reality will shatter and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results won't be pretty,</v>

90
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout man of steel,</v>

91
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:44.594
<v Speaker 1>we see this to be exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Clark hides in the closet after </v>

92
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>discovering his powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hears the children afraid of him.</v>

93
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.823
<v Speaker 1>When Perry Mason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's about the possibility of </v>

94
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Superman's existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He remarks.</v>

95
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine how people on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet would react?</v>

96
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>They knew there was someone like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

97
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 1>even lowest lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superman's true.</v>

98
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Paramour is afraid when she first sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Almighty alien.</v>

99
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.993
<v Speaker 2>The questions raised by my rescuer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Subsistence are frightening to </v>

100
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:19.624
<v Speaker 2>contemplate.</v>

101
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.130
<v Speaker 1>If Clark does decide to come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it could end in his death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Case in point as a teenager,</v>

103
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Clark is framed reading a book on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Plato.</v>

104
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.533
<v Speaker 1>Plato actually detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if a perfectly just </v>

105
00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>and righteous man were to ever come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

106
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.610
<v Speaker 1>A man just like Superman in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic,</v>

107
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.640
<v Speaker 1>one of Socrates's pals suggest that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect van,</v>

108
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>we'll be scourged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rack bound,</v>

109
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.783
<v Speaker 1>evil of his eyes burned out and it lasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>after suffering every kind of evil he </v>

110
00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:48.254
<v Speaker 1>will be impale so not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Superman were to reveal his identity </v>

111
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and notably people would turn against </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and seek to kill him.</v>

112
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>A fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see play out in v Superman.</v>

113
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Snyder drives this point home by </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing the hero to the other.</v>

114
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>All good being in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was an act of God.</v>

115
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.644
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was providence when Clark debates </v>

116
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:10.934
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they preached about whether he should </v>

117
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>reveal his identity.</v>

118
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.303
<v Speaker 1>He's framed in the foreground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would they stained glass depiction of </v>

119
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:16.094
<v Speaker 1>Jesus in the background and later when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Superman rescues lowest from an escape </v>

120
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:20.084
<v Speaker 1>pod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see him in the classic crucifixion </v>

121
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>pose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

122
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.623
<v Speaker 1>not very subtle by comparing superman </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Christ snider as a real sense of </v>

123
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.604
<v Speaker 1>foreboding to man of steel because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know how Jesus's story ends and </v>

124
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>here in lies the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark has to become superman because the</v>

125
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>movie's called man of steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not hipster,</v>

126
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:39.914
<v Speaker 1>sad beard man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man of steel puts itself into a </v>

127
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>corner where it's constantly arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark shouldn't reveal his powers,</v>

128
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>that if he does become superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be feared,</v>

129
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>hated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inevitably murdered.</v>

130
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no logical reason for Clark to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal himself to the world.</v>

131
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>So this leads to two issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

132
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Clark becomes a reluctant hero and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire film becomes a refusal of the</v>

133
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

134
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.763
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reluctant hero is a well worn </v>

135
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:05.924
<v Speaker 1>narrative archetype in which a person is</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrust into circumstance where he must </v>

136
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 1>save the day despite never really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do so.</v>

137
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Think Han Solo in star wars or John </v>
<v Speaker 1>mcclane in die hard.</v>

138
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>This hero doesn't ever look to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

139
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>He's just drawn into situations where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>must.</v>

140
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.033
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark doesn't look to save anybody in </v>

141
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:24.524
<v Speaker 1>man of steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sort of ends up at the right </v>

142
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>place at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The school bus crash,</v>

143
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark's already on the bus,</v>

144
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>so why not the oil rig disaster Clarkson</v>
<v Speaker 1>in nearby fishing boat.</v>

145
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>So why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

146
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.893
<v Speaker 1>lowest gets attacked by a tentacle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sketch Clark's only a couple feet </v>

147
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the point.</v>

148
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.610
<v Speaker 1>But this reluctant hero archetype is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>antithesis of the superman myths.</v>

149
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>If Superman is the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we strive to be the hero among heroes.</v>

150
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Then his reluctance to save anybody runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to his ethos.</v>

151
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Further by making superman a reluctant </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

152
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 1>it turns him into a passive character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things happen to Clark.</v>

153
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>The bus crashed the oil rig disaster or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stage five tornado as opposed to Clark</v>

154
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:04.904
<v Speaker 1>leading the narrative through action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire film in turn becomes a </v>

155
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>refusal of the call for Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's Hero's journey.</v>

156
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>When our hero is first called into </v>
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>

157
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:14.984
<v Speaker 1>he chooses to refuse often because </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying at home is easier and far less </v>

158
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

159
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.163
<v Speaker 1>in Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new hope luke initially refuses to </v>

160
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:24.254
<v Speaker 1>help Obiwan safe Princess Leia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only when Luke returns home to see </v>

161
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:27.764
<v Speaker 1>his house destroyed and his aunt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle dead that he decides to take up </v>

162
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.574
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The refusal of the call is typically </v>

163
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:36.540
<v Speaker 1>only a brief stop on the hero's journey </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Campbell's monomyth.</v>

164
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 1>It takes up less than a 17th of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero's journey.</v>

165
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Get in man of steel.</v>

166
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.983
<v Speaker 1>Clark refuses the call to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>superman for over half the film more </v>

167
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.903
<v Speaker 1>than an hour of runtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if luke had spent over an hour </v>

168
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>contemplating the pros and cons of using</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force you'd grow to hate the guy.</v>

169
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>This becomes the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man of steel.</v>

170
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.083
<v Speaker 1>Clark spends so much time debating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>merits of becoming a hero that in the </v>

171
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 1>end he seems like a bit of a Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

172
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.013
<v Speaker 1>he's an almighty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all powerful being who can save the </v>

173
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:06.864
<v Speaker 1>earth on one leg with only his pinkie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet we the audience are as to </v>

174
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>sympathize with why he shouldn't save </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

175
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>When Jonathan Ken gets sucked up into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tornado,</v>

176
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>man of steel's intent is to depict the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment as a tragic lesson,</v>

177
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but in execution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

178
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:23.454
<v Speaker 1>it's far less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark could save his Paul from imminent </v>

179
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 1>death but can't because doing so would </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal his powers to too many.</v>

180
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I let my father die</v>

181
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.593
<v Speaker 2>because I trusted him because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that I had to wait at the </v>

182
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 2>world is not ready</v>

183
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.321
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

184
00:09:42.321 --> 00:09:45.590
<v Speaker 1>man of steel treats this as a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable action,</v>

185
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>like of course that's what anyone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

186
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Superman's just let us father die </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's at least 25 people under</v>

187
00:09:51.441 --> 00:09:55.160
<v Speaker 1>the bridge watching even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blame is placed on the world.</v>

188
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.410
<v Speaker 1>It's our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Kent died.</v>

189
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.333
<v Speaker 1>We're to ennoble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the superhero that could've saved </v>

190
00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:01.341
<v Speaker 1>him in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

191
00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two seconds.</v>

192
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Man of steel carries the cynicism to its</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion where superman in Zod duke it</v>

193
00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:08.414
<v Speaker 1>out in metropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonchalantly killing hundreds of </v>

194
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.210
<v Speaker 1>thousands if not more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not superman who is cavalier to</v>

195
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:16.640
<v Speaker 1>this loss of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the film itself,</v>

196
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.593
<v Speaker 1>man of steel doesn't realize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implication this conclusion has on </v>

197
00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:21.224
<v Speaker 1>superman and his heroic ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ending has treated it as a triumph </v>

198
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.570
<v Speaker 1>superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeat sod and saves the world.</v>

199
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Who cares about a couple hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand extras?</v>

200
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Lois is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get over it.</v>

201
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Humanity never even accept superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After Clark reveals his powers and sorta</v>

202
00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:36.104
<v Speaker 1>saves metropolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government tracks in with a drone </v>

203
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.880
<v Speaker 1>questioning his motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know you're woke one day?</v>

204
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Act against America's interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superman two doesn't trust humanity.</v>

205
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.823
<v Speaker 1>Destroying the Afa mentioned drone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the government to take a hike </v>

206
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.140
<v Speaker 1>that they'll never find out where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>hangs his cake.</v>

207
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uneasy relationship between humanity</v>

208
00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:59.411
<v Speaker 1>and superman is still well exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's still isn't ready.</v>

209
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.823
<v Speaker 1>Early in man of Steel Clarksburg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father Jarell echoes the idealistic </v>

210
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:06.080
<v Speaker 1>sentiments of Superman's past.</v>

211
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.420
<v Speaker 3>You will give the people of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

212
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.703
<v Speaker 3>an ideal to strive tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right behind you that will stumble </v>

213
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.673
<v Speaker 3>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in time they will join you in the </v>

214
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Sun Gow and time it will help them </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish one.</v>

215
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.910
<v Speaker 1>This is the Superman of the 1930s of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Donner and Christopher Reed.</v>

216
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.080
<v Speaker 1>But the words ring hollow in Snyder's </v>
<v Speaker 1>morally obfuscated worldview.</v>

217
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.153
<v Speaker 1>By the end of man of steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snyder has crafted a superman who </v>

218
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:42.544
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have saved a bus full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children who let his father die and </v>

219
00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:49.090
<v Speaker 1>destroyed the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sought to protect all the idealism of</v>

220
00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:49.924
<v Speaker 1>yesteryear has been sucked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaving a hollow shell were one stood </v>

221
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>beacon of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man of steel's intent is to pave the way</v>

222
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:57.244
<v Speaker 1>for Superman and the Dcu to showcase the</v>
<v Speaker 1>uplifting origins of the greatest of </v>

223
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 1>heroes and begin a multi crossover film </v>
<v Speaker 1>franchise.</v>

224
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.343
<v Speaker 1>But in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film has the exact opposite </v>

225
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 1>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wanton destruction of the third act,</v>

226
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 1>the wishy washy hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morally obfuscated world,</v>

227
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.283
<v Speaker 1>all paint a picture far from idealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an uplifting story of a hero </v>

228
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>coming into his own and being accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the world.</v>

229
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>This is a story of a hero being forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>into hiding,</v>

230
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.993
<v Speaker 1>ultimately rejected in fear by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and the people he seeks to </v>

231
