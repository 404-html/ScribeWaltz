00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool cabin in the woods and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy quest are all well loved and it's</v>

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>easy to see why they make fun of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very genres they inhabit and they're all</v>

5
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:23.071
<v Speaker 1>part of a growing trend of media that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes fun of well itself be a superhero.</v>

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.293
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day I decided to become a crime </v>

7
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 2>fighting swindler who rooms with a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other little whiners at the Neverland</v>

8
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 2>mansion of some creepy old bald heaven's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gate looking mother.</v>

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.083
<v Speaker 2>On that day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send your shiny happy as a friend </v>

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 2>request</v>

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and since this trend isn't going away </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon,</v>

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>we thought we'd give you a little primer</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the complex nature of self criticism.</v>

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 1>So in order to gain elevated insight on </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we get on the world around us,</v>

14

<v Speaker 1>let's explore the ever so important </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between satire and parody.</v>

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Both satire and parody exists to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize the world and hey,</v>

16
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that's like my number one favorite thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.933
<v Speaker 1>but like all things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of bad satire and bad </v>

18
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:05.444
<v Speaker 1>parody today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to figure out the heart of </v>

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Thanks again to alliance here is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spire and now back to your regularly</v>

42
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>scheduled geek out.</v>

43
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with a refresher course in </v>
<v Speaker 1>alphabetical order.</v>

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.833
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man follows cytoma a hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of defeating any enemy in a </v>

45
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>single punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the flip side,</v>

46
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>we've got watchman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story that asks the question,</v>

47
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>what if superheroes were just people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like us?</v>

48
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get into categorizing,</v>

49
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about what these stories have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in common.</v>

50
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.203
<v Speaker 1>Most clear is their willingness to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetypes of their respective </v>

51
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:35.684
<v Speaker 1>genres and twist them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man takes an animate trope </v>

52
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:39.884
<v Speaker 1>like magical girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll off sailor moon and distorts it </v>

53
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:43.034
<v Speaker 1>with a swole ex convict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the familiar hardworking </v>

54
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:46.934
<v Speaker 1>every man hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just a De buffed version of </v>

55
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.024
<v Speaker 1>Toku hero common writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we have a Goku s world's </v>

56
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:53.894
<v Speaker 1>savior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he looks like a low rent Halloween </v>

57
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>costume attached to an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the watchman side,</v>

58
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>we've got an army of Superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>knockoffs.</v>

59
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Both roar shack and Ozymandias are </v>
<v Speaker 1>distillations of certain elements of </v>

60
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ozymandias says the charismatic,</v>

61
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.314
<v Speaker 1>rich and hyper intelligent Bruce Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The force of good that the world needs </v>

62
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>clean cuts and above the fray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roar Shack,</v>

63
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:14.974
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the detective Batman fighting crime </v>

64
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>and searching for truth with a capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>t,</v>

65
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>much like the world's greatest detective</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] shacks,</v>

66
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.074
<v Speaker 1>quest for truth and justice fears </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerously close to a horrifying </v>

67
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.064
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the ugly version of Frank </v>

68
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Miller's take on the Cape Crusader and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for good measure,</v>

69
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.674
<v Speaker 1>there's night owl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recreation of the nerdy inventor </v>

70
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>version of Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allah,</v>

71
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Adam West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his shark repellent.</v>

72
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.173
<v Speaker 1>Both stories use these twisted up </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of recognizable characters to </v>

73
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>make observations about what we take for</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted and supercrew stories.</v>

74
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>The types of heroes we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we expect them to do,</v>

75
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 1>and what we think motivates them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

76
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>10 of them done by changing up what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're used to.</v>

78
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>The departure from the original tropes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks out like a sore thumb.</v>

79
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>In both stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this contrast explores what we'll call a</v>

80
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>more realistic version of superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

81
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>What is having God like power really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to find out?</v>

82
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's turn to a pair of hairless wonders</v>
<v Speaker 1>site Toma and Doctor Manhattan.</v>

83
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.073
<v Speaker 1>While a pair of galactically powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes isn't exactly the kind of thing </v>

84
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.524
<v Speaker 1>you'd see in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're reaction to power very much is </v>

85
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.273
<v Speaker 1>both Cytoma and doctor Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the boredom afforded by </v>

86
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence site to must spends his time</v>
<v Speaker 1>mourning his lack of a true challenge.</v>

87
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>While doctor Manhattan mostly has weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

88
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>hangs out on Mars and contemplates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of time despite their vast power,</v>

89
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.083
<v Speaker 1>neither is a traditional protagonist </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that man or Goku because neither </v>

90
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:46.954
<v Speaker 1>one struggles in a traditional way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Goku has to train with King Kai </v>

91
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>and sprint along passages between </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>

92
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.383
<v Speaker 1>Cytoma just does some pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman puts together clues to solve </v>

93
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:57.604
<v Speaker 1>mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Manhattan literally knows </v>

94
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>everything and Community Jack</v>

95
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.033
<v Speaker 3>wants me to look into my future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if the colors that were publicly </v>

96
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.564
<v Speaker 3>identified,</v>

97
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>where do you see the stories about good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys overcoming the odds,</v>

98
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:11.814
<v Speaker 1>but for site and doctor Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical confrontations are over before </v>

99
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:16.134
<v Speaker 1>they start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Manhattan one the Vietnam War by </v>

100
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:19.374
<v Speaker 1>himself and cite them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat up an alien that searched entire </v>

101
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>galaxies for a worthy adversary without </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever even giving it his full effort.</v>

102
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] Motor,</v>

103
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 4>the hung a tote on Oca.</v>

104
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.493
<v Speaker 1>So what is the one critical difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the method of one punch man and </v>

105
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:39.394
<v Speaker 1>watchman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watchman is a satire and one punch man </v>

106
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:42.934
<v Speaker 1>is a parody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While one is ultimately an adoration of </v>

107
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.354
<v Speaker 1>the genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lovingly pokes fun at the other is a </v>

108
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:49.234
<v Speaker 1>burn it all approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the heroes who used to cover our </v>

109
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:52.324
<v Speaker 1>jammies according to satire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a critical reintroduction by Dustin </v>

110
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.243
<v Speaker 1>Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>org of is designed to attack vice or </v>

111
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:00.524
<v Speaker 1>folly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seeks to persuade an audience that </v>

112
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>something or someone is reprehensible or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

113
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>When it takes over another literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

114
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>it tends not to just borrow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to subvert it or direct its energies</v>

115
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>toward alien ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watchmen as a satire doesn't just attack</v>

116
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the vices and follow these up society </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the superhero genre.</v>

117
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.673
<v Speaker 1>It's specifically assaults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of anyone possessing powers </v>

118
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that even approach that of a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>

119
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>It's largely about nuclear fear only </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

120
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.944
<v Speaker 1>it's not just directed at a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a blue skinned super being John </v>

121
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Osterman becomes doctor Manhattan in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear accident,</v>

122
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>ease then recruited and used as a weapon</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win the Vietnam War.</v>

123
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Even his name is eight far from subtle </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to the Manhattan project.</v>

124
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>He's fascinated by both time and clocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and throughout watchman.</v>

125
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>We often see clocks counting down toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>undesirable outcomes.</v>

126
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>In the graphic novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is even clearer.</v>

127
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear security is referenced all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and fear of nukes drives many kinds</v>

128
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.334
<v Speaker 1>of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vietnam War was a response to fear </v>

129
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:04.364
<v Speaker 1>of nuke wielding Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>riots and violence on the home front in </v>

130
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:07.694
<v Speaker 1>opposition to superheroes all returned </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fear of a nuclear threat </v>

131
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>symbolized by blue skin space wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor Manhattan,</v>

132
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.503
<v Speaker 1>the Ussr and USA need a fabricated </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack on earth to even set aside their </v>

133
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:18.914
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposing the extreme lengths taken and </v>

134
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>casualties sustained just to de escalate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear standoff.</v>

135
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Watchman shows the dangers of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it's indifference.</v>

136
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.733
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Manhattan gets bored of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and in his boredom becomes </v>

137
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>increasingly conflicted about the nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence.</v>

138
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 5>I prefer this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't let here</v>

139
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.900
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible]</v>

140
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 5>I am tired of earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's people.</v>

141
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired of being caught in the tangle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their lives.</v>

142
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>It's ultimately a grim joke about </v>
<v Speaker 1>superman.</v>

143
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>If he were really an all powerful being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would he worry about humanity?</v>

144
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.583
<v Speaker 7>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the existence of life is a highly over </v>

145
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This phenomenon,</v>

146
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 1>it's even clear in his sartorial </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

147
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Superman rocks his costume to evoke the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American values of truth,</v>

148
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the American way.</v>

149
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 1>While doctor Manhattan strips himself of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology and gets naked,</v>

150
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.233
<v Speaker 1>watchmen makes a more explicit point </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the corrupting influence of power </v>

151
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 1>with the comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superhero stories ask us to believe that</v>

152
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 1>the good guys with power are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>who deserve it,</v>

153
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:28.930
<v Speaker 1>but watchman is more than willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out that they're not.</v>

154
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.973
<v Speaker 1>The comedian is a hero in the mold of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain America or Wolverine and extra </v>

155
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:34.750
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

156
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>hyper capable super soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a sadist psychopath.</v>

157
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.353
<v Speaker 1>Watchman isn't just making these </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations to satisfy your brain's </v>

158
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:43.714
<v Speaker 1>thinky parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It uses the form of the superhero genre </v>

159
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.290
<v Speaker 1>like Batman clones and all powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and the content of the story,</v>

160
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 1>the try and persuade an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but persuade them of what you might ask.</v>

161
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly the problem of nukes,</v>

162
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.073
<v Speaker 1>but Griffin also says that satire wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to prove that something or someone is </v>

163
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible or ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this case,</v>

164
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>that's something is the very idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>superheroes.</v>

165
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.543
<v Speaker 1>Watchman is dedicated to making the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the very existence of superheroes </v>

166
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.593
<v Speaker 1>is a dangerous fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can compare it to a classic work of </v>

167
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>satire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Swift's a modest proposal where</v>

168
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the author suggests solving famine by </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating children,</v>

169
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't actually pro kid eating.</v>

170
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.643
<v Speaker 1>He was just trying to show the failure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of society in his time and did so by </v>

171
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:29.784
<v Speaker 1>inhabiting the form of a political essay</v>
<v Speaker 1>that overtly exhibits the indifference </v>

172
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>to suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize those in power.</v>

173
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.283
<v Speaker 1>Just as swift use the form of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political essay to make the people who </v>

174
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>write to political essays look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartless monsters.</v>

175
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.243
<v Speaker 1>Watchmen uses the form of a superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative to make superheroes look </v>

176
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:52.761
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and it posits that superheroes</v>
<v Speaker 1>create an asymmetry of power that defies</v>

177
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:54.714
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>

178
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.733
<v Speaker 1>Superheros can violate the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>commit acts of violence at their own </v>

179
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.364
<v Speaker 1>discretion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they have everybody's best </v>

180
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:02.244
<v Speaker 1>interests at heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That degree of power inevitably becomes </v>

181
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:05.724
<v Speaker 1>dangerous as different ethical frames </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow roar shack and Ozzie Mandy has </v>

182
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.193
<v Speaker 1>come into conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be super powers or nuclear </v>

183
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:13.974
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that degree of power will inevitably </v>

184
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:16.854
<v Speaker 1>lead to some ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watchman can make these arguments so </v>

185
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:20.994
<v Speaker 1>effectively because it uses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of superhero stories to make </v>

186
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>its argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Griffin says,</v>

187
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 1>when it takes over another literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

188
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.793
<v Speaker 1>it tends not just to borrow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to subvert it and direct its </v>

189
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:32.454
<v Speaker 1>energies toward alien ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every inch of watchman is dedicated to </v>

190
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>turning the traits we love about </v>
<v Speaker 1>superheros against themselves.</v>

191
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.283
<v Speaker 1>And the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchman condemned superhero fiction as </v>

192
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a genre because it promotes a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy.</v>

193
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>But site to mum might want a word about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

194
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.623
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that one punch man is </v>
<v Speaker 1>poking fun at superheroes of both Manga </v>

195
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 1>and western comics as well as the genres</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

196
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 1>The villains in one punch man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give intentionally over the top versions</v>

197
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 1>of classic villain monologue.</v>

198
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

199
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.300
<v Speaker 8>We beat up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But to know,</v>

200
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 8>I mean that will pull the hallway on the</v>
<v Speaker 8>wheel.</v>

201
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.590
<v Speaker 8>Somebody [inaudible] you say </v>
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] [inaudible] every</v>

202
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.890
<v Speaker 1>character has a dramatic backstory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coy got cool.</v>

203
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.110
<v Speaker 1>What ain't no causal connection and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting spirit.</v>

204
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It uses anime and Manga tropes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean creatures,</v>

205
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>swarms of people in suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydro style monsters and more.</v>

206
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.510
<v Speaker 1>It's always in conversation with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in the same genre,</v>

207
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.030
<v Speaker 1>but without the judgment we see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>watchman.</v>

208
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one punch man isn't a satire.</v>

209
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a parody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's investigate the difference and</v>

210
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:51.494
<v Speaker 1>I promise it's more than just semantics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already seen how satire has a </v>

211
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>specific persuasive function usually in </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to something,</v>

212
00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.973
<v Speaker 1>but parody isn't quite like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parody exaggerate certain elements of </v>

213
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:04.594
<v Speaker 1>its target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ultimately affirms the literary </v>

214
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>form it in habits to be more specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worsening to Robert videon and his essay</v>

215
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>are parody and deconstruction secretly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

216
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.123
<v Speaker 1>Parody excepts the logic and rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its genre and takes them seriously as </v>

217
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>tools of its criticism.</v>

218
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.070
<v Speaker 1>As Finian says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it operates from inside of the texts and</v>

219
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:24.904
<v Speaker 1>ideas it criticizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of how Genoese mirrors a classic </v>

220
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:28.594
<v Speaker 1>animate protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He suffered a trauma and is trying to </v>

221
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 1>become strong enough to get revenge for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people he loves,</v>

222
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but at every turn he's rendered a joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>by site.</v>

223
00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Tim has immense power that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish Genoese.</v>

224
00:12:39.271 --> 00:12:40.104
<v Speaker 1>His appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can still relate to his desires and </v>

225
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.844
<v Speaker 1>they aren't treated as stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just irrelevant because cytoma </v>

226
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>has thrown all the rules out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the things we mentioned before,</v>

227
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.673
<v Speaker 1>the tropes references,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the structures of character arcs </v>

228
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:53.944
<v Speaker 1>and stories are all classic Monga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt one punch man's </v>

229
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 1>creators truly love the genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't think it's above ridicule.</v>

230
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:02.523
<v Speaker 1>The show makes this argument by </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerating the overpowered hero </v>

231
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 1>archetype in many Manga anime and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>western comics,</v>

232
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>no matter how powerful the villain gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero gets stronger to match.</v>

233
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Take Goku for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies get stronger and stronger,</v>

234
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:17.284
<v Speaker 1>but Goku is always able to save the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually through some intense training </v>

235
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>regimen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragonball z celebrates this,</v>

236
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.860
<v Speaker 1>but one punch man asks why there are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other characters.</v>

237
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Jenn Osen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moomin writer,</v>

238
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 1>much like crillon or Yom Tra train hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to match their stronger friend,</v>

239
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 1>but they never can and honestly don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to.</v>

240
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.243
<v Speaker 1>The real hero will always be there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the day by turning anime and Manga </v>

241
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.444
<v Speaker 1>on their heads to make these points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man is critiquing superhero </v>

242
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:44.284
<v Speaker 1>stories by showing precisely where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>double and collapse for a great example </v>

243
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>of where the lessons of superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories collapse.</v>

244
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.723
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to Moomin writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a classic backstory and grows </v>

245
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.713
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

246
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind you touch him.</v>

247
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to help people and be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes.</v>

248
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:07.680
<v Speaker 1>He looks up to Suny choosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew God,</v>

249
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.943
<v Speaker 1>not unlike Memoria for my hero academia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and much like Muh Doria before he gets </v>

250
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:13.684
<v Speaker 1>his powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moomin writer constantly gets his ass </v>

251
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a message about real life.</v>

252
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.813
<v Speaker 1>Some people just don't have what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes to be a superhero and telling </v>

253
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>everyone they can might get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously hurt.</v>

254
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 1>We can see the same intrusion of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Cytoma.</v>

255
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Most superhero stories end with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

256
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Happy to be saving the world and waiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next challenge.</v>

257
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Site to Ma has a more relatable </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

258
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.453
<v Speaker 1>Boredom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to overcome and that </v>

259
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 1>leaves you without a reason to get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bathtub.</v>

260
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>This may sound like the satire rules so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

261
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 1>but instead of trying to show something </v>
<v Speaker 1>as reprehensible or ridiculous,</v>

262
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.793
<v Speaker 1>the crucial point for parody is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body of words is always pre loved and </v>

263
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.083
<v Speaker 1>redirected.</v>

264
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Parody is used to awaken us to the flaws</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the things we love,</v>

265
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but not to demolish a flawed genre like </v>
<v Speaker 1>watchmen aspires to do with superheroes.</v>

266
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man makes clear it's mocking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animate to help expand the possibilities</v>

267
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.374
<v Speaker 1>of what it can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated relationship mocking </v>

268
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>the things you love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be hard to tell how to approach a</v>

269
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>parotic text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to fit in,</v>

270
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.863
<v Speaker 1>if we read parody straight as sincere </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression without relating it to a </v>

271
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 1>structure of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we misunderstand it.</v>

272
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parody is a tool for criticism,</v>

273
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:24.644
<v Speaker 1>but that criticism operates on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the genre it's </v>

274
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:27.794
<v Speaker 1>criticizing is worth improving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man calls on us to get away </v>

275
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:32.084
<v Speaker 1>from the bigger monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger gun and find other stories to </v>

276
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 1>tell stories about chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice skaters,</v>

277
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 1>and even Mahjong players opening up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of anime.</v>

278
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Storytelling is a noble goal and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is sorely needed.</v>

279
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.313
<v Speaker 1>The ending of the show amounts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of the dragon ball z model of </v>

280
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much like Goku.</v>

281
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Boreaus is constantly seeking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest opponents in the universe,</v>

282
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.253
<v Speaker 1>but unlike our say in hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's willing to destroy innocence to </v>

283
00:15:56.971 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 1>find the ones he wants at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>site to match the actual strongest being</v>

284
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 1>his board of all the power one punch man</v>
<v Speaker 1>is displaying both ways.</v>

285
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:08.390
<v Speaker 1>This infinite power model can fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

286
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:09.224
<v Speaker 1>it's important to remember that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch man may criticize a certain kind </v>

287
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:12.434
<v Speaker 1>of superhero narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't disavow the value of </v>

288
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:15.584
<v Speaker 1>heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show wants us to recognize and </v>

289
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 1>emulate the bravery we see from Genoese </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Moomin writer,</v>

290
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but also recognize the silliness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

291
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:23.954
<v Speaker 1>We find those lessons in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical difference between </v>

292
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 1>one punch man and watchman.</v>

293
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.933
<v Speaker 1>Both use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're overpowered characters to make </v>

294
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:31.124
<v Speaker 1>points about the genre they inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but watchman makes condemnations of all </v>

295
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:34.844
<v Speaker 1>sorts of social systems beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of superheroes and even </v>

296
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:41.990
<v Speaker 1>condemned the superhero genre itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Punch man feels different.</v>

297
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a general agreement that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories we've told forever need a little</v>

298
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:46.634
<v Speaker 1>refresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean abandoning them </v>

299
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With that in mind,</v>

300
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 1>we can label things like Chemo America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Strangelove,</v>

301
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and heather's as satire alongside </v>
<v Speaker 1>watchman and Deadpool,</v>

302
00:16:56.391 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>galaxy quest and blazing saddles as </v>
<v Speaker 1>parody alongside one punch man.</v>

303
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And the Big Bang theory is none of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because that show,</v>

304
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching guys.</v>

305
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:06.723
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
