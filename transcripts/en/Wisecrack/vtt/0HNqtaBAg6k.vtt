00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Hip Hop's been dying or dead every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single year since it's inception,</v>

2
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>so along with its eight of the top eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>downloads last week,</v>

3
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still got a tremendous influence in</v>

4
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 1>American pop culture is still a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand building community in the world.</v>

5
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>They have all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>inspiration and influence for American </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream.</v>

7
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They made the president by shifting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>a race dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.463
<v Speaker 1>they run DMC got MTV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no black people at all except </v>

10
00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

11
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.143
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had ahead and changed a lot in </v>

12
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>America and where people see each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jay is not dead files.</v>

13
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I can tell this last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ll Cool J's on the number one show.</v>

14
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Ice T is not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 45.</v>

15
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.443
<v Speaker 1>I'm 51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got new businesses that are hip hop </v>

16
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>related and they're growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel hip hop is dead.</v>

17
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that any good signs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say that.</v>

18
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess young people do download cricket</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people would,</v>

19
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>might buy a Whitney Houston record or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

20
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hip Hop is being consumed as much now as</v>

21
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an important statement and it</v>

22
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:26.830
<v Speaker 1>has as much effect or the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream culture now as ever,</v>

23
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:27.664
<v Speaker 1>and that's another good statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to predict the death of a </v>

24
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cultural phenomenon that's transformed</v>

25
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>America in so many ways.</v>
