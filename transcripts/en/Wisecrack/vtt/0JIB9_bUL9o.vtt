00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there has to be some evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the curriculum.</v>

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

3
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm fairly old fashioned and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.043
<v Speaker 2>I like to teach basic math skills and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that in order to really master </v>

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to practice them.</v>

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I may not be the most innovative teacher</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

10
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.453
<v Speaker 3>mmm.</v>

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I keep coming back to the standards that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Every teacher has his or her own skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 2>preferences in terms of how to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

16
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

17
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>we have to make sure that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we learned the basics.</v>

18
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

19
00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I believe that happens</v>

21
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:03.804
<v Speaker 2>in education is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to latch onto the latest reform </v>

22
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would call it the reform do shore.</v>

24
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 2>And I would suggest most of these reform</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements that we have,</v>

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 2>we've tried before they're recycled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new name slapped on them.</v>

26
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.153
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not a big fan of new reform ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thinking that those reform efforts </v>

28
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 2>are silver bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think this happens.</v>

29
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

30
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it's the teacher who </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes the difference.</v>

31
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So if it's a question of a program,</v>

32
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>she's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

33
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the person that is far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than the program.</v>

34
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
