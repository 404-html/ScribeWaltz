00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen here,</v>

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>wisecracks resident science nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:10.874
<v Speaker 1>14 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared was waiting in line seven hours </v>

4
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.274
<v Speaker 1>early for the matrix reloaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing with my star wars action </v>

5
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:16.574
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting out weird love triangles between </v>

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.113
<v Speaker 1>on Django and Princess Leia and trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to convince my family that my home </v>

7
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:22.664
<v Speaker 1>planet was actually older on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I decided to flex my star wars </v>

8
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:26.204
<v Speaker 1>geekery for this discussion of Disney's </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest installment in the star wars </v>

9
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:29.624
<v Speaker 1>cinematic universe solo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie fills in the backstory of our </v>

10
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.644
<v Speaker 1>favorite smuggler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned hero showing us how a young Han </v>

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.853
<v Speaker 1>transforms into the legendary Han Solo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of given that the other films have </v>

12
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:42.344
<v Speaker 1>been massive cash cows solo was expected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do pretty well even considering the </v>

13
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>last jet I backlash and potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>franchise fatigue,</v>

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.353
<v Speaker 1>but solo flopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on track to be the first </v>

15
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>unprofitable star wars film ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should surprise you for one reason.</v>

16
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.943
<v Speaker 1>Everything about this movie is designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be marketable and give you the warm </v>

17
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 1>fuzzies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what went wrong?</v>

18
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look in this wisecrack </v>
<v Speaker 1>addition on how even psychology couldn't</v>

19
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>sell solo thanks to our sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.org</v>

20
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>for making this video possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>spoilers solo kicks off sometime around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year 13 bb,</v>

22
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:17.864
<v Speaker 1>why that's 30 to 64 on the lawful </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar and ends roughly 10 years </v>

23
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:22.424
<v Speaker 1>before rogue one and a new hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie follows aspiring pilot and </v>

24
00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:26.254
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] to be Han as he goes from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright eyed romantic to an outlaw who </v>

25
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.104
<v Speaker 1>shoots first.</v>

26
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.273
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

27
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.203
<v Speaker 1>along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he picks up a level below 190 year old </v>

28
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Wiki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a notorious techno sexual smuggler,</v>

29
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.303
<v Speaker 1>and the Millennium Falcon doesn't quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull off the Kessel run in less than 12 </v>

30
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>parsecs unless you round down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's Solos,</v>

31
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:47.144
<v Speaker 1>fundamental strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make us nostalgic for the good old days </v>

32
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:50.624
<v Speaker 1>of star wars by cramming in as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>Easter eggs and nods to the past our </v>

33
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>wars as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the golden dice,</v>

34
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the planet Solutia Viper droids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandalorian armor,</v>

35
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Jabba the Hutt boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bounty hunter,</v>

36
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Colo crawfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course darth Maul,</v>

37
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's just scratching the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie is one Easter Egg.</v>

38
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:08.354
<v Speaker 1>After the next pulling references,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only from the films but also from </v>

39
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>the novelizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video games and the animated series,</v>

40
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.703
<v Speaker 1>the reference to Rsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lando skies from return of the Jedi and </v>

41
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:19.034
<v Speaker 1>cure is impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Command of terrorist Khasi are great </v>

42
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>ways to make fans who know two </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations worth of star wars lore feel</v>

43
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>like they have a special connection to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>

44
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>but despite the outstanding fan service </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some great deep cuts,</v>

45
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the movie falls short because nostalgia </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone can't propel a film and might even</v>

46
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:36.314
<v Speaker 1>get in the way.</v>

47
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't read Disney's mind.</v>

48
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>The reason they relied on all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia seems pretty obvious.</v>

49
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.763
<v Speaker 1>Marketers use nostalgia to sell stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and it's no different in </v>

50
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at the force awakens.</v>

51
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.433
<v Speaker 1>Besides bringing back the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and actors from the original </v>

52
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>trilogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film paid homage to its predecessors</v>

53
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.820
<v Speaker 1>in the form of things like trash </v>
<v Speaker 1>compactors,</v>

54
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>pod racing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flags,</v>

55
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>and even that Werewolf alien thing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mos.</v>

56
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 1>Cantina neuroscience has a possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for why this trick can be </v>

57
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>super effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It involves the brain's reward system.</v>

58
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Some imaging studies have shown that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the brain tied to feelings like</v>

59
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:11.284
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and euphoria are activated </v>

60
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're experiencing a stalled jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for long time star wars fans,</v>

61
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.493
<v Speaker 1>seeing things like Han's dice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing the sound of the ethereal </v>

62
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:20.554
<v Speaker 1>fighters or like a jump to hyperspace </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the feel good pathways in your </v>

63
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.124
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what Disney wants to </v>

64
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.674
<v Speaker 1>happen because then you'll keep coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>back for more or buy some solo dice </v>

65
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>cufflinks and a tee shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nostalgia.</v>

66
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.034
<v Speaker 1>Marketing aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Easter eggs do something else in </v>

67
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.274
<v Speaker 1>the case of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being on the receiving end of an inside </v>

68
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.004
<v Speaker 1>joke makes us feel more affiliation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jokester and makes them seem more </v>

69
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>socially desirable.</v>

70
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.393
<v Speaker 1>I understood that reference and </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the encryption theory of </v>

71
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes are funny,</v>

72
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:55.050
<v Speaker 1>not just because of their superficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>

73
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.033
<v Speaker 1>but because they broadcast shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge between the person and their </v>

74
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.604
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you caught yourself laughing in </v>

75
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.724
<v Speaker 1>the scene where is losing it over being </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten at Gerrick or the one where he's </v>

76
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:06.414
<v Speaker 1>holding up the guard severed arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The writers did their job from a </v>

77
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:09.684
<v Speaker 1>psychology standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Disney shares your inside </v>

78
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that peoples' arms off makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like they get it.</v>

79
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Droid don't pull people's arms out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sockets when they lose,</v>

80
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 1>but here's where solo lands itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

81
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.093
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of movies have inside jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>references will also giving us well </v>

82
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:32.834
<v Speaker 1>developed characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the process of doubling down on </v>

83
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.174
<v Speaker 1>the stall did Easter eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney fails to give us a legit origin </v>

84
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solos.</v>

85
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Fundamental problem is that Alden </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ehrenreich has to convince us.</v>

86
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 1>He's Harrison Ford's Han Solo from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very start.</v>

87
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>He's got the arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wisecracks,</v>

88
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.553
<v Speaker 1>the hustle hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to transition is basically 75 </v>

89
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:53.670
<v Speaker 1>percent complete right from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

90
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>so by the time he shoots back at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

91
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.323
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like much of a change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been acting like Harrison Ford the </v>

92
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:01.254
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film makes gestures of a </v>

93
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:03.624
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem halfhearted when cram </v>

94
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>between 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>other nostalgia triggers as a result for</v>

95
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:09.594
<v Speaker 1>a film that promises to showcase a </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of one of the most beloved </v>

96
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:13.224
<v Speaker 1>characters and Saifai history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels more like a buzzfeed top 10 </v>

97
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:17.094
<v Speaker 1>list of Han Solo Trivia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even significant plot points like the </v>

98
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>way Han gets his last name meets Lando </v>
<v Speaker 1>or winds the Millennium Falcon.</v>

99
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Feel like Easter eggs take Han's </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with chewy Han's,</v>

100
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.393
<v Speaker 1>only known him for a couple of minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the relationship has the same </v>

101
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:34.290
<v Speaker 1>dynamic as it does throughout the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the saga.</v>

102
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.363
<v Speaker 1>Normally we'd expect this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to develop and mature over </v>

103
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because Disney's top priority was to</v>

104
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>trigger nostalgia and familiarity rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the truly show development,</v>

105
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.773
<v Speaker 1>it ends up feeling shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie gets it out of the way and </v>

106
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:49.164
<v Speaker 1>moves onto the next bit of Trivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point of an origin story is to show </v>

107
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 1>us how a character we know and love </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to be who they are.</v>

108
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.473
<v Speaker 1>For Batman Begins Shows Bruce Wayne </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastering his fears to become the </v>

109
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>legendary dark night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce starts out as a troubled,</v>

110
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>angsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared youth at the beginning and by the</v>

111
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>end he's disciplined and unafraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

112
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.573
<v Speaker 1>strange starts off as a self centered </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeon who only believes in cold </v>

113
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>rationality and ends the film as a self </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial mystic.</v>

114
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.833
<v Speaker 1>But to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of get it when you're recasting </v>

115
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:20.744
<v Speaker 1>such an iconic role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stuck between a rock and a hard </v>

116
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Hans antiques at the beginning seemed</v>

117
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:25.994
<v Speaker 1>completely different than Harrison Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience wouldn't believe they were </v>

118
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.684
<v Speaker 1>watching Han Solo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have him act like Ford Solo </v>

119
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:32.744
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sacrifice a convincing arc for </v>

120
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.774
<v Speaker 1>familiarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were to try to give the fillmore </v>

121
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.443
<v Speaker 1>credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might say that the arc is Han going </v>

122
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.114
<v Speaker 1>from an aspiring scoundrel to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealist when he decides to hand over </v>

123
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>the hyper fuel to the budding </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance.</v>

124
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.260
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that the exact same arc from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new foe?</v>

125
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.333
<v Speaker 1>At worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film has no work and at best it's a </v>

126
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:55.094
<v Speaker 1>retread of episode four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say solo doesn't have </v>

127
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.064
<v Speaker 1>moments of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's really the best thing you </v>

128
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>could say about it and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you're looking for,</v>

129
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in our opinion,</v>

130
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Disney could have done better by </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering an intriguing character </v>

131
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.433
<v Speaker 1>rather than relying on Cipa Pilsen a </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier in the form of endless Easter </v>

132
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's our take.</v>

136
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>area of the blue triangles is 25 and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>five red squares are identical,</v>

137
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 1>what does the area of the entire shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull out some scrap paper if you need </v>
