00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.113
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons that the gun debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country is so contentious is </v>

2
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:09.984
<v Speaker 1>that there's very little good data on </v>
<v Speaker 1>who owns guns and what share of guns </v>

3
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.704
<v Speaker 1>used in crimes are illegal guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason there's not good </v>

4
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>data is because the debate is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>contentious in the first place.</v>

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.723
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one proposal that I like a lot is to </v>

6
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>create kind of a national firearms </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety administration,</v>

7
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>something like the National Highway </v>
<v Speaker 1>Traffic Safety Administration Nitsa,</v>

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.063
<v Speaker 1>which correlates transportation data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we want to know about what really </v>

9
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:39.421
<v Speaker 1>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>there's still 30 to 35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic fatalities a year,</v>

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot considering how much we </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

12
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.063
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we know about how every </v>

14
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>accident happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better we can do at preventing.</v>

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.303
<v Speaker 1>Similarly with something like guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we know about how guns are </v>

16
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.784
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they get in the hands of the people </v>

17
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>who use them for crime.</v>

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of guns are never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

19
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever used in any crime.</v>

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.084
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is a really useful way to </v>

22
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.803
<v Speaker 1>look at what data can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think right now we have people on the </v>

23
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>gun on one side of the gun debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

24
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>we need our guns for whatever and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>leave us alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other side saying,</v>

27
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.563
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all guns are terrible and you need to </v>

28
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>take them all away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>both those arguments would seem to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit naive,</v>

30
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but we can't really get to a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because we don't have the data.</v>

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally grew up in a gun culture.</v>

33
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in upstate New York where most</v>
<v Speaker 1>families had guns for hunting,</v>

34
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>target practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

35
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of people I knew never</v>
<v Speaker 1>use their guns for any crime.</v>

36
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.433
<v Speaker 1>Most laws that we make to protect people</v>
<v Speaker 1>from guns are usually ignored by the </v>

37
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>criminals and obeyed by the law abiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

38
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that if you had better </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no one more in favor of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>than law abiding gun owners because they</v>

40
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be smeared and lumped in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the criminals who use guns.</v>

41
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's where data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.733
<v Speaker 1>can be kind of different tool in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal when you're trying to make </v>

43
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:11.874
<v Speaker 1>better policy or public policy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're just kind of shouting </v>

44
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:16.704
<v Speaker 1>at each other with your ideology rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than understanding how people actually </v>

45
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:20.454
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

46
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.953
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
