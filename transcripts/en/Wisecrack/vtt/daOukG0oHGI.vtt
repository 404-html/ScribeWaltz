1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.743
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared here on the set of one of our </v>

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>other projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so infinity war is finally out.</v>

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>We saw it and wanted to try something </v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>whereas we usually dive into the themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies,</v>

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>and subtexts of these films to gain a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better appreciation for them today.</v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.554
<v Speaker 1>We're going to use these elements to </v>
<v Speaker 1>propose some educated predictions of </v>

7
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>what will happen in a vendors for so </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to this wise crack quick take on</v>

8
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>infinity war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part one.</v>

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Spoilers ahead for part one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we're flattering ourselves,</v>

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.764
<v Speaker 1>part two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also a huge things to digital sputnik </v>

11
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.064
<v Speaker 1>for supplying us with their gear to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>these quick takes and all of our other </v>

12
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:38.754
<v Speaker 1>shoots look pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make it so easy to just throw up </v>

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:41.904
<v Speaker 1>some lights and shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thanks again to digital sputnik for </v>

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>making lighting fun for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on with the quick take,</v>

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.903
<v Speaker 1>the central question of infinity war is </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the value of an individual life </v>

16
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>can be weighed against the greater good </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the film.</v>

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.253
<v Speaker 1>Characters are posed with the conundrum </v>
<v Speaker 1>should they sacrifice a loved one for </v>

18
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the greater good at the films climax </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarlet,</v>

19
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>which attempts to kill vision for lover </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to destroy the mind stone.</v>

20
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.753
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quill reluctantly tries to shoot </v>

21
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.064
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lover only for his blast to turn </v>

22
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:11.094
<v Speaker 1>into bubbles and later thanos throws her</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the altar on for me or as a </v>

23
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:15.184
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice to earn the soul stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of moral philosophies all </v>

24
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic debates,</v>

25
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>one that we've talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian,</v>

26
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>consequentialism versus deontology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To briefly summarize,</v>

27
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.044
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consequentialism defines actions as </v>

28
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>ethical if they achieve a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome for them.</v>

29
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:34.144
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what one must do to achieve </v>

30
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>those ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deontology on the other hand,</v>

31
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.743
<v Speaker 1>is a duty based ethic that suggests that</v>
<v Speaker 1>no outcomes can justify heinous things </v>

32
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>like murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to neutralize a lot of threats</v>

33
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>before they even happen.</v>

34
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That's punishment usually came after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>scarlet witch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>

36
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I was all ultimately make their</v>

37
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>moral decisions based on consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of duties.</v>

38
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>For everyone that's not a rip off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark side.</v>

39
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>This greater good is fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

40
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Do anything to stop Vanos from gathering</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the infinity mcgovern's.</v>

41
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.823
<v Speaker 1>It's basically trolley problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie you are arriving a trolley </v>

42
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.803
<v Speaker 1>when the brakes fail and on the track </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of you are five workman that you </v>

43
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:22.221
<v Speaker 1>will run over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can steer to another track,</v>

44
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but on that track is one person you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would kill instead of the five.</v>

45
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>The mad titans understanding of good is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a universe in perfect balance,</v>

46
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.613
<v Speaker 1>firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance between life and death and </v>

47
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>secondly balanced between humans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

48
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.433
<v Speaker 1>This second one echoes the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophies of Thomas Robert Malthus </v>

49
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>who suggested that when you have finite </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

50
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you therefore have an ideal population </v>
<v Speaker 1>size and when you exceed that population</v>

51
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty and starvation increase,</v>

52
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.343
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the film is critical of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who tries to use math to measure </v>

53
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:56.904
<v Speaker 1>the word of some lives against others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sacrifices and never actually </v>

54
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>succeed in bringing about the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

55
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Their actions are at best few tile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>at worst maximally evil star,</v>

56
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.034
<v Speaker 1>Lord and scarlet witch is attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice their loved ones are thwarted </v>

57
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>by Thanos and fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a matter of moments.</v>

58
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.510
<v Speaker 1>We see this critique again when at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning Dr.</v>

59
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.443
<v Speaker 1>strange says he won't hesitate to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony or Peter die to protect the </v>

60
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v Speaker 1>timestamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This changes when at the end he reneged </v>

61
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.343
<v Speaker 1>and trades the time stone for Tony's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in recognition of a higher moral </v>

62
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.714
<v Speaker 1>duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is best articulated in captain </v>

63
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>America is constant refrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't trade lives basically,</v>

64
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>if you ever want to know what the film's</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard as right look no further than the</v>

65
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>mcu is moral exemplar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rogers.</v>

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.153
<v Speaker 1>So what does the films moral perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us about what will happen in </v>

67
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>avengers four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To answer that,</v>

68
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.583
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the comic run that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired infinity war even more than </v>

69
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Jim's Darwin's Infinity Gauntlet mini </v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

70
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.153
<v Speaker 1>We're talking of course about Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hickman's epic marble run that weaves </v>

71
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>its way through fantastic for future </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of vendors,</v>

72
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>new avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity,</v>

73
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.823
<v Speaker 1>and secret wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the run that it introduced the </v>

74
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>coal obsidian outriders and the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of will conda from the film's finale,</v>

75
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely wars.</v>

76
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Moral philosophy is ripped right from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hickman.</v>

77
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>If you thought the stakes were high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this movie,</v>

78
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>check this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An infinite number of parallel universes</v>

79
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:23.464
<v Speaker 1>were colliding together at the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth threatening to annihilate their </v>

80
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.253
<v Speaker 1>trillions of inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to prevent this was to </v>

81
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>destroy one of the Earth's along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the billions of people living on it,</v>

82
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.833
<v Speaker 1>or to put it another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing millions to say it was the </v>

83
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.023
<v Speaker 1>ultimate trolley problem with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence tied to the tracks and heroes </v>

84
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.074
<v Speaker 1>like iron man and Black Panther forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grapple with whether or not to pull </v>

85
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:48.064
<v Speaker 1>the lever in a moment of truth for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved to child walks right up to the </v>

86
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>moral line before refusing to cross it.</v>

87
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I know I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I must,</v>

88
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:57.454
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were damned the very day we thought </v>

89
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it was for men to decide things such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>this as always,</v>

90
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.803
<v Speaker 1>it's captain America who most clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>champions duty based morality that like </v>

91
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>roar shack is utterly uncompromising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the face of Armageddon,</v>

92
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't let people die because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesser of two evils or expedient or </v>

93
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:18.364
<v Speaker 1>because it serves the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't compare the act against </v>

94
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see someone who needs help and I help.</v>

95
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't measure people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saved them,</v>

96
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps the ultimate exemplar of </v>
<v Speaker 1>duty based doing what is right,</v>

97
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>ethics and Hickman's work is Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic himself,</v>

98
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.703
<v Speaker 1>Reed Richards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's his arch that will be most </v>

99
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>telling for how avengers four will </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclude in secret wars Dr.</v>

100
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.813
<v Speaker 1>Doom like fantasies with the infinity </v>
<v Speaker 1>gauntlet has become for all intensive </v>

101
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

102
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but he's not defeated by force or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clever plan,</v>

103
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>but by recognition that reed is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely,</v>

104
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>morally superior man who would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>at being God.</v>

105
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.490
<v Speaker 1>This is Hickman's main thesis and one we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think will play out in avengers for one,</v>

106
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>ought not way lives and calculate how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve the greatest good,</v>

107
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but instead merely act according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's duty.</v>

108
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.480
<v Speaker 1>So here are our predictions for avengers</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one fan.</v>

109
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to enjoy that sunset at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the movie quite as much as he</v>

110
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.624
<v Speaker 1>had hoped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His regret over Gomorrah's death will </v>

111
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>convince him that a single life can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>irreducible worth even one way against a</v>

112
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>world in which everyone enjoys peace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty,</v>

113
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>which obviously they won't.</v>

114
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 2>It was still a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

115
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

116
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

117
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid plan,</v>

118
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 1>so fantas will neither be forced nor </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricked into giving up the gauntlet.</v>

119
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard to punch or trick God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Fan Osu like doom in Hickman.</v>

120
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Secret wars will become convinced by our</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes that his convictions were wrong,</v>

121
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.033
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't deserve to be God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he will forfeit his power freely to </v>

122
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>the one who will convince Dan will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Stark.</v>

123
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.673
<v Speaker 1>Since the first iron man movie stark has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been the defacto protagonist of the </v>

124
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>franchise more than any other character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had the most dynamic character arcs</v>

125
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 1>from narcissistic to self sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and avengers,</v>

126
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:20.680
<v Speaker 1>one to the antagonist mired in </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequentialist ethics and civil war to</v>

127
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>realizing his ultimate failure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity war.</v>

128
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 1>He will achieve the greatest redemption </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end.</v>

129
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by coming around to caps,</v>

130
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.300
<v Speaker 1>duty-bound way of seeing the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and secondly,</v>

131
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>by being the one to defeat fan owes more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any other character.</v>

132
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Tony has made the most improvement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in need of the most improvements.</v>

133
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:41.434
<v Speaker 1>Still he'll go from someone too selfish </v>
<v Speaker 1>to handle a relationship to someone so </v>

134
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:49.270
<v Speaker 1>noble as to wield the power of a god </v>
<v Speaker 1>with integrity.</v>

135
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.530
<v Speaker 1>We're guessing that starks conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with pepper about his dream of her being</v>

136
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:56.500
<v Speaker 1>pregnant will propel this final growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his character,</v>

137
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 1>but we're not quite sure as to how </v>
<v Speaker 1>lastly,</v>

138
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Stephen strange his decision not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice Tony's life to save the time.</v>

139
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:04.444
<v Speaker 1>Stone will prove the crux around which </v>
<v Speaker 1>stark success and therefore the </v>

140
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:08.584
<v Speaker 1>salvation of the universe will resolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But importantly it won't be because </v>

141
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:13.084
<v Speaker 1>strange saw that that was the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve that one in 14 million </v>

142
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for no other reason.</v>

143
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Then it was the right thing to do as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hickman's work.</v>

144
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.103
<v Speaker 1>It will be explicit that doing the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for no other reason than because </v>

145
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>it's right will lead our heroes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>salvation.</v>

146
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.010
