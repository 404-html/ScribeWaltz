<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you've been following South Park and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our South Park podcast perspect our </v>

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.233
<v Speaker 1>authortalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably noticed that the show </v>

5
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:16.674
<v Speaker 1>feels a little different these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last season South Park often explored </v>

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>our reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current events,</v>

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>especially outrage and despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while that's still front and center,</v>

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>this season hones in on a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling resignation.</v>

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>So far south park has been showing how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern world has overwhelmed,</v>

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.153
<v Speaker 1>devastated and just exhausted us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get super depressed about the </v>

11
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>world in this wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quick take on the first four episodes of</v>

12
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>South Park season 22 and is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick recap of the season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far in episode one,</v>

14
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Sharon freaks out about the daily school</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings at South Park elementary</v>

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.493
<v Speaker 2>chosen were shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were killed at a school where they </v>

16
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>were supposed to be</v>

17
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else seems to care.</v>

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else is going on?</v>

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.213
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartman is Jessica Jonesing to </v>

20
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>investigate these seemingly impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>That token hasn't seen Black Panther in </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode two.</v>

22
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Father Maxi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the butts of a plethora of pedophile</v>

23
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:25.010
<v Speaker 1>jokes leaves his post in a crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith only to find hope with butters.</v>

24
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a priest being best friends with the kid</v>

25
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:28.124
<v Speaker 1>is a bad look and the archdiocese </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakenly sends out a cleanup crew to </v>

26
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>take care of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episode Three C's,</v>

27
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>south parks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resident Christmas mass,</v>

28
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Scott lose his position after a series </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ambient fueled tweets.</v>

29
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.693
<v Speaker 1>While episode four takes the Marsh </v>
<v Speaker 1>family from South Park to a Colorado </v>

30
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>weed farm or randy goes toe to toe with </v>
<v Speaker 1>big vape.</v>

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>So what do all these episodes have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Income?</v>

32
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.953
<v Speaker 1>A few things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to start with maybe the </v>

33
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>biggest sensitization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't understand South Park's commentary</v>

34
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>on desensitization.</v>

35
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.213
<v Speaker 1>We have to understand the way the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributes to an alters collective </v>

36
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:02.564
<v Speaker 1>grief scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur and joan climb and describe the </v>

37
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:05.714
<v Speaker 1>way in which images of suffering are </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriated to appeal emotionally and </v>

38
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:10.304
<v Speaker 1>morally to certain audiences and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>these images have become extremely </v>

39
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>important to the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>

40
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:16.544
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that aside from just reporting on </v>

41
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>tragic events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media commercializes victims who are</v>

42
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>taken up into processes of global </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing and business competition,</v>

43
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.043
<v Speaker 1>when experiences turned into commodities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are leveraged by mainstream or </v>

44
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>social media to give us all the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something strange happens.</v>

45
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>The result is that in the end we become </v>
<v Speaker 1>numb to the suffering of others.</v>

46
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.223
<v Speaker 1>South Park is telling us something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already know that it's easy to be </v>

47
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>impassioned about a thing at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's equally easy to burn out.</v>

48
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.313
<v Speaker 1>In episode one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see southpark beset with a plague of </v>

49
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>school shootings during which most </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave with a colt nonchalance.</v>

50
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this one.</v>

51
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Nobody seems to give a shit except </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon</v>

52
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.070
<v Speaker 3>series.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you not hear what your child said?</v>

53
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Kids died at his school</v>

54
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.770
<v Speaker 1>instead of listening to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please to think of the children,</v>

55
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.813
<v Speaker 1>Randy and the rest of south park believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issue is that she's on her </v>

56
00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:17.210
<v Speaker 1>period or worse entering menopause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see Mr.</v>

57
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.043
<v Speaker 1>Marsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>menopause is almost like a super period </v>

58
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's been known to last for up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

59
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.023
<v Speaker 1>Oh by God and from their episodes three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and four open with gunshots at South </v>

60
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Park elementary before panning over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the more pressing story.</v>

61
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.173
<v Speaker 1>Desensitization is so rampant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The citizens of south park aren't even </v>

62
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.850
<v Speaker 1>outraged about Catholic priests </v>
<v Speaker 1>molesting children.</v>

63
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.370
<v Speaker 1>They've simply resigned to making jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

64
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.293
<v Speaker 3>The great one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nelson Salvation in a little boy's </v>

65
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:50.720
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to post that one for sure.</v>

66
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Even when his son is theoretically in </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

67
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Randy can help but crack jokes and post </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on social media,</v>

68
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 3>but where would prisco this late at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night to a midnight sale at boys Rs.</v>

69
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 3>What'd she say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She sat too.</v>

70
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I midnight sale at buys our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

71
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Can I pose that?</v>

72
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.033
<v Speaker 1>We see here how social media makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much easier to become desensitized </v>

73
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>by berating us with images and ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

74
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Even providing an incentive to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things as jokes or potential posts</v>

75
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>rather than serious events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all these cases,</v>

76
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>no one even tries to make the world any </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

77
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They're too busy just trying to bear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare world they're living in.</v>

78
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So how can these horrible things be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed?</v>

79
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>If everyone has become indifferent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be blunt,</v>

80
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.323
<v Speaker 1>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people just become exhausted and </v>

81
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:39.964
<v Speaker 1>eventually submit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much sense Sharon makes </v>

82
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>the townspeople write her off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually she becomes comfortably numb,</v>

83
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.513
<v Speaker 1>barely reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When her son stand becomes the latest </v>

84
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>victim in a school shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the end of the world.</v>

85
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Maxis quest to become a better priest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends the same way.</v>

86
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He rejects the churches institutional </v>
<v Speaker 1>coverup of the kid touching epidemic and</v>

87
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>slaughters the clean up crew with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own home boney,</v>

88
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>but he's also accepted that he can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the church,</v>

89
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>nor can he expect the adults to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>their behavior.</v>

90
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>All he can do his vow to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

91
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.273
<v Speaker 1>As an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like there's not much choice </v>

92
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but to go with the flow and accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as given as horrible as it is,</v>

93
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a lesson kyle learns the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

94
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:25.744
<v Speaker 1>courtesy of his good friend Mr Hankey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everyone's favorite Christmas poo </v>

95
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>finds himself in trouble for taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambien and tweeting things like</v>

96
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 3>the city council members are a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy licking is llamas.</v>

97
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hankey not only refuses to admit he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did anything wrong,</v>

98
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.553
<v Speaker 1>he continues to act like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hankey looks for help clearing his </v>

99
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:44.874
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one will help him because as </v>

100
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Gerald says,</v>

101
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I learned a long time ago that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend poop,</v>

102
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 3>you get stained.</v>

103
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hankey finds hope in Kyle who vows to</v>

104
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 1>stick by his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

105
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>strong woman gives birth to a quintuplet</v>
<v Speaker 1>of PC babies who react negatively to any</v>

106
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.180
<v Speaker 1>violations of political correctness.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sorry I until food aisle.</v>

108
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.833
<v Speaker 1>The babies and the Hanky collide when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Christmas Poo puts on an early </v>

109
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Christmas celebration and the baby's cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>at even the most benign of holiday.</v>

110
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:16.424
<v Speaker 1>Well wishes Mr Hankey goes off the rails</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kyle's attempts to calm the </v>

111
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.474
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaves him stained both literally and </v>

112
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

113
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.653
<v Speaker 1>like in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heil has to give up and stop defending </v>

114
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:35.190
<v Speaker 1>his friend because if he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll get ostracized to they're gone.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I want to stand by my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see how that goes for you in 28</v>

117
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 1>so what happens when you want to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>back against an exhausting,</v>

118
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:56.410
<v Speaker 1>infuriating world when you want to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things better or steep?</v>

119
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:57.244
<v Speaker 1>The pressures of modern life aside from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gunshots in the intro episode four </v>

120
00:07:01.961 --> 00:07:05.470
<v Speaker 1>starts very differently than the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of being desensitized,</v>

121
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.453
<v Speaker 1>we see randy finally get riled up after </v>
<v Speaker 1>three episodes of handwaving the crises </v>

122
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What possibly moves randy,</v>

123
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.840
<v Speaker 1>just take action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A picture of a dog's butthole.</v>

124
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dog's butt hole.</v>

125
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

126
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.243
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decides to abandoned South Park and </v>

127
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:24.524
<v Speaker 1>move on up to Colorado bar where he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>live a life of tegrity there he starts </v>

128
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:30.074
<v Speaker 1>growing weed but refuses to participate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the progress promised by executives </v>

129
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.771
<v Speaker 1>at big vape there by pitting his tegrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>against their concepts of progress.</v>

130
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Your Mommy teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't pay to mess with progress.</v>

131
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she taught Ms.</v>

132
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mouse too.</v>

133
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to fight for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tegrity,</v>

134
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>don't forget to bring it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

135
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 1>this is funny because randy really has </v>
<v Speaker 1>no tegrity to speak of.</v>

136
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.733
<v Speaker 1>His home spun style doesn't come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up on a farm or being born into </v>

137
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a random choice.</v>

138
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:07.241
<v Speaker 1>A guy in a small town made his accent is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clear expectation that he picks up and</v>

139
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>drops on a whim.</v>

140
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever all you're doing is blowing </v>

141
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:11.650
<v Speaker 3>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

142
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Freudian</v>

143
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to your accent?</v>

144
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.753
<v Speaker 1>He even uses the language of Tegrity as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an advertising device at the end of the </v>

145
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>episode made with a little color out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>

146
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his tegrity nonsense is made of the same</v>

147
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>stuff as the claims to progress that </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon and the vape executive make.</v>

148
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>You can be a part of progress or you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get run over by it.</v>

149
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.823
<v Speaker 1>Just as tegrity is a costume randy puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>on to sell the jungle Kush progress is </v>

150
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:38.804
<v Speaker 1>just an advertising device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an excuse to move a product with </v>

151
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>flavors that target children</v>

152
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 4>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trust,</v>

153
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.040
<v Speaker 4>and can we based on price</v>

154
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>and south park even the attempts to heal</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an exhausting world,</v>

155
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>whether through progress or integrity </v>
<v Speaker 1>are totally self and foolish,</v>

156
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>but what does tegrity even mean while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero's try to hash it out.</v>
