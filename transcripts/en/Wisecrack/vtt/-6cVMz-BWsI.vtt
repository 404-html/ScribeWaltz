00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>A good example of collaboration is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the international space station.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.253
<v Speaker 1>The International Space Station is </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably one of the most complex </v>

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:07.674
<v Speaker 1>complicated structures ever built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bigger than a football field if it </v>

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>was on the earth and we'll weigh about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million pounds a.</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>It is an amazing orbiting research </v>
<v Speaker 1>facility and it was built in space by 15</v>

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.244
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these nations were not always </v>

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:22.884
<v Speaker 1>the best of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some cases they were on opposite </v>

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.074
<v Speaker 1>sides of the Cold War and opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite sides of the space race and </v>

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>what enabled this to happen in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What enabled this construction project,</v>

10
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.064
<v Speaker 1>what enabled enabled this amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment of humanity was the </v>

11
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>willingness to set aside our differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>and work together towards a common goal.</v>

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.943
<v Speaker 1>And what we did is we found something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we agreed on in this particular </v>

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>space exploration,</v>

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.253
<v Speaker 1>and we decided to work through that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what developed is personal </v>

15
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.443
<v Speaker 1>People got to know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to see that their hopes and </v>

17
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>dreams and their motivation for being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space program and being in the space</v>

18
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:03.024
<v Speaker 1>business were the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And through those personal </v>

19
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust developed and through that trust,</v>

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.913
<v Speaker 1>that trust that was built through those </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal relationships enabled the </v>

21
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>program to weather the storms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weather,</v>

22
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.334
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eventual bumps in the road and the </v>

23
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>crises that occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is a,</v>

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>that is a really good lesson that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply.</v>

25
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>We can take the lesson that built the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international space station and bring it</v>

26
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.284
<v Speaker 1>down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could put it in the context of a </v>

27
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.894
<v Speaker 1>rapidly developing hyper interconnected </v>
<v Speaker 1>global society and realize that we can </v>

28
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.094
<v Speaker 1>do amazing things here on earth by </v>
<v Speaker 1>applying that same level of </v>

29
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the secret sauce,</v>

30
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to seek the low hanging fruit,</v>

31
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.434
<v Speaker 1>seek those things that we do agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and use that to build relationships and </v>

32
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.694
<v Speaker 1>to build the platform through which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can then start to address the things </v>

33
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>that we don't agree on.</v>
