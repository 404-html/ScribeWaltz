<v Speaker 1>watches in sunglasses,</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>more on movement at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.483
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Greetings and welcome to earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 2>cinema.</v>

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I am your host Garrick's warm you Lloyd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This week's artifact is Django unchained</v>

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.743
<v Speaker 2>starring disabled musician Ray Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and directed by podiatrist Quintin </v>

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino as a prequel to his earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 2>the Hitler buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film begins in Texas just before the</v>

9
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:35.454
<v Speaker 2>first of America's seven civil wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our protagonist is King Schults and </v>

10
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.464
<v Speaker 2>inexplicably German bounty hunter who </v>
<v Speaker 2>buys an anthropomorphic piece of </v>

11
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 2>property named Django in order to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>him a makeover.</v>

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Now sufficiently dolled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They travel around from town to town,</v>

13
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 2>spreading the gospel of getting shot in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face.</v>

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 2>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an army of ghosts tries to stop them,</v>

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 2>but every good bounty hunter knows a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ghosts.</v>

16
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Greatest weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buster</v>

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly comes to an end.</v>

19
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 2>So rather than split up earth's first </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever interracial business friendship,</v>

20
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 2>sholtz decides to help reunite Django </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his wife,</v>

21
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.114
<v Speaker 2>broom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilda,</v>

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 2>another piece of property who is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>German for absolutely no reason.</v>

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.183
<v Speaker 2>They find her at a soup plantation </v>
<v Speaker 2>called candy land on the outskirts of </v>

24
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 2>the peppermint forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her owner,</v>

25
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Calvin candy land is a real sportsman in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense that he likes to sit on a sofa</v>

26
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>watching grown men UFC each other to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

27
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.293
<v Speaker 2>So Schultz and Jango pretend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in buying some of Calvin's </v>

28
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.473
<v Speaker 2>living sports equipment for $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>which due to inflation equals about 89 </v>

29
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:40.994
<v Speaker 2>quintillion blog electrons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to throw broom Hilda into the </v>

30
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all casual like,</v>

31
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>but Calvin's dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steven doesn't mess around when it comes</v>

32
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:49.814
<v Speaker 2>to his hard earned blogger drones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He correctly guesses that they know </v>

33
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>broom Hilda from before the opening </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit started.</v>

34
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.383
<v Speaker 2>So Calvin does the very reasonable thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of raising the price to match their </v>

35
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 2>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It going to be dodge,</v>

36
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.953
<v Speaker 2>good old fashion capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They signed the revised contract and </v>

37
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 2>everything works out great for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of movie,</v>

38
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

39
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

40
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:17.464
<v Speaker 2>There hasn't been nearly enough human </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood schultes decides his pride is the </v>

41
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 2>most valuable substance on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more than truffled petroleum.</v>

42
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>So rather than risk touching Calvin's </v>
<v Speaker 2>greasy little arm clause,</v>

43
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 2>he chooses to get himself killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Django is captured and sold to a bitcoin</v>

44
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 2>mine with long hours and no health </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

45
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh Day everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the way there,</v>

46
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:40.834
<v Speaker 2>Django uses his graduate level education</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hoodwink some unsuspecting and </v>

47
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.364
<v Speaker 2>entirely unnecessary Australians then </v>
<v Speaker 2>travels back through the molasses swamp </v>

48
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:50.374
<v Speaker 2>to candyland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He explodes everything without much </v>

49
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:53.740
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally,</v>

50
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:54.574
<v Speaker 2>he in Broome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilda right off together on to land sea </v>

51
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:58.094
<v Speaker 2>horses now and movie Django unchained is</v>
<v Speaker 2>first and five most a slavery revenge </v>

52
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.614
<v Speaker 2>fantasy white images stained with blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent the vengeance wreaked upon </v>

53
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>white slavers the two colors combining </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a more pleasing pinkish hue.</v>

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.673
<v Speaker 2>Violence against white people is </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently depicted in grotesque </v>

55
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 2>stylized detail.</v>

56
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 2>The massacre at candy land is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoonish that we have no choice but to</v>

57
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>contract our diaphragms in a laughing </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner like this.</v>

58
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In contrast,</v>

59
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.590
<v Speaker 2>violence against slaves is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic and often portrayed indirectly</v>

60
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.623
<v Speaker 2>and the climax of the paper view UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight the spilled gumballs serve as a </v>

61
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:38.944
<v Speaker 2>proxy for blood and guts and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>diaphragms remained static as the </v>

62
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>killing strike is blocked from view like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

63
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.943
<v Speaker 2>The horrifying scene where dogs rip </v>
<v Speaker 2>D'artagnan apart is mostly portrayed </v>

64
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.960
<v Speaker 2>through reaction shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Oscar nominated sound sounded.</v>

65
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>The film takes inspiration from widely </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparate sources,</v>

66
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.043
<v Speaker 2>from Spaghetti Westerns to Ravioli </v>
<v Speaker 2>blaxploitation films all the way to </v>

67
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.634
<v Speaker 2>German spaetzle who knew the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a name of a character in the </v>

68
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 2>most popular of old German legends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at its heart,</v>

69
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Django unchained as an example of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>revisionist western wear.</v>

70
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Traditional Hollywood westerns </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasized mythical American themes such</v>

71
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 2>as manifest destiny and calling people </v>
<v Speaker 2>pilgrim.</v>

72
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Jake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Ese there.</v>

73
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.393
<v Speaker 2>Revisionist westerns provided a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspective addressing the </v>

74
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>exploitation of native Americans and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decline of the cowboy era.</v>

75
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.444
<v Speaker 2>In light of industrialization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Django unchained takes aim at slavery's </v>

76
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>power structures by showing that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were perpetuated by frauds.</v>

77
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.543
<v Speaker 2>Big Daddy initially makes a big fuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a black man riding one of allows </v>

78
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.533
<v Speaker 2>creatures on his land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which threatens to undercut his </v>

79
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 2>dominion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a free man.</v>

80
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>He can ride what he pleases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on my property,</v>

81
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but he immediately caves when Schultz </v>
<v Speaker 2>offers them a financial teat from whence</v>

82
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>he can suckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have 5,000</v>

83
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>things I might say that could change </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

84
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Come on inside and get yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>something cool to drink.</v>

85
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Calvin pretends to be a James Franco </v>
<v Speaker 2>file is a bit of a Franco file,</v>

86
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 2>which reflects his opinion that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than everyone else.</v>

87
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 2>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just another ignorant heck with the</v>

88
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.050
<v Speaker 2>hots for his sister to select can fish.</v>

89
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't speak French to him.</v>

90
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.234
<v Speaker 2>It'll embarrass him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sholtz and Django are able to easily </v>

91
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 2>infiltrate these power structures by </v>
<v Speaker 2>using the very illusions that reinforced</v>

92
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

93
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.723
<v Speaker 2>you know money Schultes plays the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Genteel dentist to put people at ease </v>

94
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 2>with Novacane and gain the element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise.</v>

95
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.290
<v Speaker 2>What kind of Dennis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Augie,</v>

96
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>you haven't practiced dentistry in five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years after Django is captured,</v>

97
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.443
<v Speaker 2>is able to convince his captors not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>to release him but to arm him gun belt </v>

98
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.303
<v Speaker 2>because they assume the power structures</v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting immigrants in America will </v>

99
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:48.664
<v Speaker 2>hold and they did hold at least until </v>
<v Speaker 2>America was met with the greatest </v>

100
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:57.421
<v Speaker 2>immigrant of all and asteroid made of </v>
