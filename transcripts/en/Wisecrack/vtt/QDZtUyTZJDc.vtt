00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

2
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I am your host.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrick's were ameloid.</v>

3
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is jaws directed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wonder kid himself.</v>

4
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.123
<v Speaker 1>Stephen wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film follows police officer John </v>

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.873
<v Speaker 1>Brody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The town's only lifeguard when a shark </v>

6
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>rocks a girl back and forth until she </v>
<v Speaker 1>dies.</v>

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>He tries to close down the beach so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get to land,</v>

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>but the mayor's deepen the pocket of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable local business that crook,</v>

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>the mayor's plan works for five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the shark eats chucky.</v>

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.513
<v Speaker 1>Naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the town decides the safest solution is </v>

11
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>for everyone to just try and kill it </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

12
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.883
<v Speaker 1>but not quint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actual shark hunter with a resume </v>

13
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:51.914
<v Speaker 1>longer than his nails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brody brings on a brilliant scientist </v>

14
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 1>named hooper who offers his professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.203
<v Speaker 1>It was a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day the fishermen catch dinner </v>

16
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and the mayor opens the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who bird calls bullshit.</v>

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Since this sharks belly has an airtight </v>
<v Speaker 1>alibi and said,</v>

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>you still got a hell of a fish out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>on England day,</v>

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>some kids pull a hilarious prank while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shark pulls one of his own.</v>

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with no options left.</v>

21
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>The capitalist mayor is forced to hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>quince and turn the town Communist.</v>

22
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>What follows is a human male getaway on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a boat for the weekend full of fishing,</v>

23
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.423
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and terrifying monologues about </v>

24
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:30.824
<v Speaker 1>subtraction.</v>

25
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>So 1100 men when they were 16 and come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the sharks took the rest.</v>

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the shark can't stay away.</v>

27
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And the trio try throwing barrels at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's Mario,</v>

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>even though its name is Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hook the shark,</v>

29
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>but their boat conveniently breaks down </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like me.</v>

30
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I watched the fault in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarks,</v>

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.343
<v Speaker 1>hooper tries to put it in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ends up getting in himself the goof </v>

32
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>while Quinn tries kicking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering he's a policeman.</v>

33
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.443
<v Speaker 1>Brody shoots Dennis until he explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaws Herald and the age of Hollywood </v>

34
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:06.384
<v Speaker 1>blockbusters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which always got there do come award </v>

35
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.624
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got everything a human with eyes </v>

36
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.054
<v Speaker 1>could want from its merchandise tie-ins </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it's complex to notes score to its </v>

37
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:17.724
<v Speaker 1>high concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Premise high because you have to be </v>

38
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:20.964
<v Speaker 1>stoned to think of this for reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown to our archeologists earthlings </v>

39
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>met this film with immense amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thoughts.</v>

40
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.873
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first for the species through a Marxist </v>

41
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.374
<v Speaker 1>Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amities devastation can be viewed as </v>

42
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>retribution for capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disease that made humans rich.</v>

43
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few of them early on.</v>

44
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:40.164
<v Speaker 1>The film shows how the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests of amities business owners </v>

45
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>trump the needs of the common people.</v>

46
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I had a point of view and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks for many of the motel.</v>

47
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.014
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel?</v>

48
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Even though the common folk can't count</v>

49
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

50
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>the mayor refuses to band swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would hurt the town's bottom line.</v>

51
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>While you've Brodie is similarly </v>
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied with this rich dude sick </v>

52
00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:05.460
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

53
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.290
<v Speaker 4>I know you got a lot of founders </v>
<v Speaker 4>downtown,</v>

54
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
<v Speaker 4>but I've got a couple of problems with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the house or was she could take care of </v>

55
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.163
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got some cats parking in front of </v>

56
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.204
<v Speaker 4>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can</v>

57
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>lifeguard and handyman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well doesn't this cop do,</v>

58
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>but ignoring the pleas of the common </v>
<v Speaker 1>folk nearly ruins the town after Dennis,</v>

59
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>his reign of terror claims various </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horses and boat porches.</v>

61
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>The mayor finally allows brody hooper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and quint to go kill the shark,</v>

62
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>even though they could have done it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own at any time.</v>

63
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.863
<v Speaker 1>This echoes marks belief that capitalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ultimately be overthrown by the </v>

64
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>unhappy masses on a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This transition of power cures Amedee of</v>

65
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>its capitalist hangover so it can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to drinking.</v>

66
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.803
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jaws can be viewed more broadly as a </v>

67
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for corrupt government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as government.</v>

68
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.923
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film offered American earthlings a </v>

69
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.154
<v Speaker 1>way to vent their frustration with </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians in the wake of Watergate </v>

70
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:58.894
<v Speaker 1>gate and this interpretation the mayor </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in for Nixon sharing his famous </v>

71
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>distrust for law enforcement or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellas.</v>

72
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Let's be reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half his pension for covering up </v>

73
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>incriminating evidence.</v>

74
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.300
<v Speaker 4>What else could have done that to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl?</v>

75
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Bulk of ballet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

76
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:15.630
<v Speaker 4>I think possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

77
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.540
<v Speaker 4>call me over the phone</v>

78
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 1>and his nautical themed suits when he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly disgraced.</v>

79
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.183
<v Speaker 1>The audience experiences well-deserved </v>
<v Speaker 1>relief just as the American people did </v>

80
00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>when Nixon resigned from office to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the moon.</v>

81
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>If psychology is more your cup of herb </v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

82
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>jaws can be read as a Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautionary tale.</v>

83
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.920
<v Speaker 1>It's all psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud posited,</v>

84
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:39.050
<v Speaker 1>there were three sections to the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

85
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.860
<v Speaker 1>The ID in charge of animal desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Super Ego,</v>

86
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.180
<v Speaker 1>which controls morality and the Eggo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which balances a healthy breakfast.</v>

87
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Dennis represents the primal desires of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ID,</v>

88
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>driven to consume things both </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuratively and literally.</v>

89
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 1>The town and it's government or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Superego,</v>

90
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.630
<v Speaker 1>imposing laws ostensibly for the greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

91
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And the Eggo is where these two forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet,</v>

92
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Speaker 1>usually the shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here,</v>

93
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:05.984
<v Speaker 1>the balance has broken down rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding the line between mindless </v>

94
00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>consumption and moral snobbery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aid runs wild baby.</v>

95
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 1>It's only when brody kills the shark </v>
<v Speaker 1>that harmony corrine is restored,</v>

96
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.420
<v Speaker 1>symbolized by him standing in a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half submerged in water,</v>

97
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.523
<v Speaker 1>where he'll eventually drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the prevailing interpretation comes </v>

98
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 1>from filmmaker Stephen wonder who </v>
<v Speaker 1>astutely proclaimed.</v>

99
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a movie about a shark named Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>for earthlink cinema.</v>
