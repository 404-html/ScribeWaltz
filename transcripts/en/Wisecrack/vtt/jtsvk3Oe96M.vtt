3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.283
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael here are some known in the </v>

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.354
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad boy of 19th century Danish </v>

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:14.904
<v Speaker 1>philosophy scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably already know two of the </v>

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:17.514
<v Speaker 1>things we love rambling about most it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack are superheroes and </v>

7
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.084
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today we're going to take a look at </v>

8
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>two films that are full of superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and big philosophical questions.</v>

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>The incredibles and incredibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two since the release of the incredibles</v>

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.764
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been much digital ink spill </v>

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>over its philosophical themes with much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it pulling around.</v>

12
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>One idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that the incredibles is making an</v>

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.673
<v Speaker 1>argument for objectivism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a philosophical theory developed by </v>

14
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:44.424
<v Speaker 1>novelists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I N rant advocates for this reading </v>

15
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.154
<v Speaker 1>point to the emphasis on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionalism of the supers and the </v>

16
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.424
<v Speaker 1>implied critique of Egalitarian Society </v>
<v Speaker 1>has evidence and while we see where </v>

17
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>they're coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the time comes,</v>

18
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in your blood.</v>

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.633
<v Speaker 1>We also think they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there is undoubtedly some </v>

20
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>objective is colored to the films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're true philosophical importance is</v>

21
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:06.144
<v Speaker 1>the way in which they consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of power from the moral </v>

22
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.504
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of having superpowers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans going insane due to a desire for </v>

23
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>power to the power and influence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.333
<v Speaker 1>These films posed questions that are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>pertinent now as they were in 2004 and </v>

25
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>this time we agree with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>course spoilers ahead.</v>

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>More in that at the end of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now back to the fantastic four,</v>

38
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean the incredibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

39
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>A quick recap in the first movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

40
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Incredible scorned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Former fan buddy wants to be a soup,</v>

41
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>but since he's a normie he decides to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use technology to kill them all.</v>

42
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Instead taking on the villainous </v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

43
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.583
<v Speaker 1>I am here buddy plans to use Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible to optimize his own personal </v>

44
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>death machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Omni drove once perfected.</v>

45
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.073
<v Speaker 1>He plans to defeat it in public so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>society will see him as a hero and </v>

46
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:29.484
<v Speaker 1>eventually he can sell his technology as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a product so that everyone can become </v>

47
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as we all know,</v>

48
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one will be Mr.</v>

49
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:42.324
<v Speaker 1>Incredible fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutered and aimless as a result of the </v>

50
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>superhero relocation program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what are you waiting for?</v>

51
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean two kid and secretly returns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the superhero game to curb and impending</v>

53
00:02:58.091 --> 00:02:58.924
<v Speaker 1>midlife crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even questions the point of the </v>

54
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian spirit of dashes elementary </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

55
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.084
<v Speaker 1>It's not a graduation is moving from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth grade to the fifth grade </v>

56
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's psychotic.</v>

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>They keep creating new ways to celebrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>mediocrity.</v>

58
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>But if someone is genuinely exceptional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you bob.</v>

59
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.423
<v Speaker 1>But he eventually comes full circle as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he realizes that his power isn't just </v>

60
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.834
<v Speaker 1>for feeling like a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead makes him responsible for </v>

61
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the good of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this parable about power,</v>

62
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.343
<v Speaker 1>we see that great power unchecked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>great responsibility leads to very bad </v>

63
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.174
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredibles two continues this </v>

64
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>exploration of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shifts the focus to the considerable</v>

65
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>influence of two media moguls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prestige,</v>

66
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not those media moguls.</v>

67
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>These ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brother Winston devore is a lifelong</v>

68
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.484
<v Speaker 1>superhero fan who wants to use his media</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and his seemingly endless </v>

69
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.924
<v Speaker 1>piles of money to repair the supers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken public image and change the laws </v>

70
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>so that they are legal again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while his sister Evelyn wants to use set</v>

71
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>it influenced to mind control supers </v>
<v Speaker 1>into doing horrible things,</v>

72
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.103
<v Speaker 1>thus ruining their public image and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that people don't put faith in </v>

73
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>them ever again.</v>

74
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.023
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in order to discern why the film has </v>

75
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>been read through the lens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Objectivism,</v>

76
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.673
<v Speaker 1>we need to first figure out what in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell is objective isn't the basic </v>

77
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>tenants of Randy and objectivism are </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

78
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.603
<v Speaker 1>The ability of human reason to gain </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective knowledge of reality to the </v>

79
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>moral aim of human life is to seek </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal happiness.</v>

80
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Three man's being is heroic in nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for that free market,</v>

81
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.184
<v Speaker 1>deregulated capitalism is the socio </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic system most suitable for this </v>

82
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.894
<v Speaker 1>happy heroism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically the philosophy of Ron </v>

83
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man is a failure.</v>

84
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.623
<v Speaker 1>He is not up to snuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His business was failing and you're </v>

85
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>bailing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a bailout and I don't like it.</v>

86
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.863
<v Speaker 1>We might usually associate heroism with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who use their powers to help </v>

87
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for rand,</v>

88
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>a captain of industry is a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>example as they're the ones who make the</v>

89
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>world better simply by willing their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and proving their superiority.</v>

90
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.973
<v Speaker 1>Randy and super heroes don't wear capes </v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather neatly press suits with </v>

91
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Italian shoes and gold plated cufflinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

92
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.293
<v Speaker 1>according to a whole bunch of writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just the sort of philosophy we </v>

93
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:17.284
<v Speaker 1>find in the incredibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normal Society represents the </v>

94
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:20.464
<v Speaker 1>meaningless egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tells us that everyone is special </v>

95
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.913
<v Speaker 1>and that it's bad to be exceptional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The supers represent randy and heroes </v>

96
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>frustrated by society's obsession with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairness and equality.</v>

97
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Only when they are able to don their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask and tights.</v>

98
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.083
<v Speaker 1>Are they able to will their own power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find happiness in their own </v>

99
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.354
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But rather than advocating for </v>

100
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.694
<v Speaker 1>objectivism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these films shine a light on the types </v>

101
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>of problems that come from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently selfish philosophy.</v>

102
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Through the failures of both [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Evelyn,</v>

103
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.873
<v Speaker 1>they explore a number of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical ideas and relationship to </v>

104
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>power and responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

105
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>the films may be an exploration of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when keeping it rand goes wrong.</v>

106
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>So let's start by taking a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first film.</v>

107
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.493
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the incredibles as objectivist </v>

108
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.583
<v Speaker 1>proponent's point to the characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrations with the inhibition of </v>

109
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>their exceptional nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Can't use his powers to stop muggins</v>

110
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>and instead professionally ruined the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives of old ladies.</v>

111
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.353
<v Speaker 1>Then there's dash who can't try out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports less t go all USAIN bolt on his </v>

112
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>classmates</v>

113
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 3>generally set her powers are nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be shutting down.</v>

114
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Our parents made us special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is special dash,</v>

115
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 3>which is another way of saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

116
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.273
<v Speaker 1>And while we see how examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's exceptional nature being </v>

117
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>suppressed by society can be read as </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectivist,</v>

118
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>it ignores some clues to the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

119
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>the insurance companies sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mr Incredibles boss is a monster who</v>

120
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>only cares about profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me how you're keeping ensure a care</v>

121
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>in the black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help me how that's possible,</v>

122
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but you were writing checks for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry hard luck and Sally Tom Story that</v>

123
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>gives you a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This of course,</v>

124
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 1>makes him an ideal candidate for a randy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hero,</v>

125
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.843
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere close to a sympathetic </v>

126
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm that happy Bob,</v>

127
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most importantly,</v>

128
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>this reading ignores Bob's moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>

129
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>which can be best understood with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>help of the Greek philosopher aristotle,</v>

130
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.573
<v Speaker 1>who's super power was getting millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of undergrads to read his boring books </v>

131
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:17.474
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When bob first shoves his middle aged </v>

132
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>body back into a suit and gets back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>

133
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.773
<v Speaker 1>he does indeed exemplify the type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish exceptionalism that rand lauded </v>

134
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:28.574
<v Speaker 1>as heroic.</v>

135
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.413
<v Speaker 1>He starts to care more about his secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero missions than he does his own </v>

136
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selfishly prioritizing his own power and</v>

137
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.224
<v Speaker 1>the pleasure it brings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you stop the movie after half an </v>

138
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then shore.</v>

139
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.113
<v Speaker 1>Mr Incredible is an objectivist and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole movie is one big o to iron rand's </v>

140
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:45.494
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for those of us who finish the </v>

141
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:47.804
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that Mr incredible is simply </v>

142
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.114
<v Speaker 1>beginning of moral journey in which he </v>
<v Speaker 1>learns about the true purpose of having </v>

143
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>great power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his lectures on ethics,</v>

144
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>aristotle tells us what it means to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moral and happy life,</v>

145
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.433
<v Speaker 1>but before giving us the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he warns us of some of the common </v>

146
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>temptations that keep us from true </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

147
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>namely pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

148
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>and power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coincidentally,</v>

149
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>all of these are essential components of</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective is happiness.</v>

150
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.783
<v Speaker 1>Much like trying to understand bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle thinks our moral journey </v>

151
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>should consist of an endless pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a steaming end.</v>

152
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>After all pleasurable activities </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually get boring.</v>

153
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Money is only for other stuff and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really makes us happy.</v>

154
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And power is often dependent on factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside our control.</v>

155
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.563
<v Speaker 1>Mr Incredible seems to fall into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil's threeway of moral temptation as </v>

156
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>is super secret superhero activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring him pleasure,</v>

157
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.243
<v Speaker 1>make him feel powerful and throw some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra o's in his bank account along the </v>

158
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:44.174
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good randy in hero in this false </v>

159
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:46.964
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's experiencing pleasure from his own </v>

160
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like masturbating you a</v>

161
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>picture of yourself and according to a a</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine,</v>

162
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't come back from that.</v>

163
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.533
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr incredible is only drawn back into </v>

164
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:05.031
<v Speaker 1>his super self via the trickery of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>old fan buddy now acting as syndrome and</v>

165
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:05.904
<v Speaker 1>while buddy wanted nothing more than to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be mister incredibles faithful sidekick </v>

166
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:09.534
<v Speaker 1>when he was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fixation on power has turned his </v>

167
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>fandom and a near psychotic obsession </v>
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>

168
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.913
<v Speaker 1>I am your biggest fan buddy has </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured his happiness and his moral </v>

169
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>goals around this pursuit of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants power so badly that it needs to</v>

170
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:25.644
<v Speaker 1>destroy the supers to prove to himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world that he has an ultimate </v>

171
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:29.844
<v Speaker 1>source of power and this does not end </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as at one point buddy doesn't seem </v>

172
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 1>to give a crap when Mr incredible almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills his assistant Mirage.</v>

173
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>That sounds a little dark for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now go ahead.</v>

174
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>If she was an objectivist before this </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter,</v>

175
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>she's throwing out her copy of atlas </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrugged afterwards.</v>

176
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.853
<v Speaker 1>On the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Mr Incredibles pursuit of personal </v>

177
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 1>power puts his family in harm's way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he realizes that his power is only moral</v>

178
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>when it's actively used in the service </v>
<v Speaker 1>of others.</v>

179
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm strong enough and this will make you</v>

180
00:09:58.801 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodness.</v>

181
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what they see is some sort of work.</v>

182
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Alec camp use you again,</v>

183
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>whether these others be as family or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent citizens of Metro Hill.</v>

184
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.040
<v Speaker 1>This stands in stark contrast with </v>
<v Speaker 1>rands.</v>

185
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Insistence that one's personal happiness</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads to the greatest good,</v>

186
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.593
<v Speaker 1>I swear by my life and my love of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will never live for the sake of </v>

187
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:21.404
<v Speaker 1>whatever law nor ask another to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's this that distinguishes buddy </v>

188
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 1>from Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

189
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.583
<v Speaker 1>An incredible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems as if a couple of objectivist </v>

190
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.310
<v Speaker 1>captains of industry might just be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>saviors of supers everywhere.</v>

191
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.443
<v Speaker 1>As the second film finds the incredibles</v>
<v Speaker 1>both broke and without government </v>

192
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:39.524
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two hyper capitalist Winston and </v>

193
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:42.824
<v Speaker 1>Evelyn Endeavor are set to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything better with their financial </v>

194
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 1>resources and media influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a moment,</v>

195
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.890
<v Speaker 1>it seems that the powers of industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>might just save the day.</v>

196
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.843
<v Speaker 1>And Randy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms the devore siblings are titans </v>

197
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>of industry ready to get what they want.</v>

198
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.793
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>E fulfill their own happiness via the </v>

199
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:00.374
<v Speaker 1>most powerful force in modern society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media as a childhood superhero nerd </v>

200
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.700
<v Speaker 1>all grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston wants to use his media influence</v>

201
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>to literally change the law so that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get what he wants,</v>

202
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a world full of cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>superheroes to idolize.</v>

203
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And though Evelyn might initially seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>on board with their brothers plans,</v>

204
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.453
<v Speaker 1>she intends to use her tech empire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that supers go extinct as she </v>

205
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>has spent her entire life blaming them </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the loss of her father.</v>

206
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.110
<v Speaker 1>It's revealed in the film that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>burglars broke into their home,</v>

207
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Evelyn and Winston's father waited on </v>
<v Speaker 1>two supers to save him,</v>

208
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.370
<v Speaker 1>but they never showed up and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered for Evelyn.</v>

209
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.293
<v Speaker 1>Her father's reliance on the supers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative of an inability to take </v>

210
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for one's own life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

211
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.433
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like how all of us who grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with spellcheck can't spell calendar </v>

212
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>or definitely to save our lives.</v>

213
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Evelyn's desire for self reliance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very random,</v>

214
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so kosher that she wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stifle the exceptionalism of others.</v>

215
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.883
<v Speaker 1>But while all of these shiny titans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry are spending billions to get </v>

216
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:03.634
<v Speaker 1>what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the villain screen slaver exposes the </v>

217
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>dark power of screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This resentment of superheroes and their</v>

218
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:14.791
<v Speaker 1>broader effect on society leads Evelyn </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create screen slaver whose mission is</v>

219
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 1>expressed in a strikingly poignant </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesto.</v>

220
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.513
<v Speaker 1>Superheroes are part of your brain lists</v>
<v Speaker 1>desired or replace true experience with </v>

221
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't talk,</v>

222
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:30.031
<v Speaker 1>you watch talk shows to watch shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel relationships,</v>

223
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every meaningful experience packaged and</v>

224
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.663
<v Speaker 1>to watch it at a distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If much of this sounds eerily true of </v>

225
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 1>our contemporary relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

226
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.363
<v Speaker 1>it's because it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we know that Evelyn is screen </v>

227
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 1>slaver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a conversation about the ills of</v>

228
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 1>the modern era with Helen in which Helen</v>
<v Speaker 1>agrees with her.</v>

229
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.423
<v Speaker 1>Which of us has the greater influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>which side of Mary you asking the </v>

230
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:57.784
<v Speaker 1>believer or the cynic cynic would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling is more important because the </v>

231
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>best sellers have the most buyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you're selling.</v>

232
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It only matters what people buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

233
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:08.134
<v Speaker 1>while I disciple of rand might argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our present digital age has led to </v>

234
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:12.184
<v Speaker 1>a capitalist utopia in which the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms can lead to massive wealth </v>

235
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>for the exceptional few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Moody's explore the effect that this</v>

236
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.210
<v Speaker 1>entertainment driven media has on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

237
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.253
<v Speaker 1>To better understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can turn to 19th century Danish </v>

238
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:26.434
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Soren Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who at times was the screen slaver of </v>

239
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:30.304
<v Speaker 1>his day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard was worried that the modern </v>

240
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:32.914
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which at that point was the dawn of </v>

241
00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:34.864
<v Speaker 1>print media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was creating a world devoid of passion </v>

242
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.343
<v Speaker 1>in which reading about the interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives of others was thought to be </v>

243
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to living an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

244
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:44.040
<v Speaker 1>oneself and align.</v>

245
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.873
<v Speaker 1>That makes me relatively convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had access to time travel and spent </v>

246
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>an afternoon reading sponsored content </v>
<v Speaker 1>on instagram.</v>

247
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.383
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard said about his own age that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they revolutionary age is an age </v>

248
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:55.534
<v Speaker 1>of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present age is an age of </v>

249
00:13:57.371 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 1>advertisement and publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens,</v>

250
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.503
<v Speaker 1>but there is instantly publicity about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for both screen slaver and </v>

251
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:05.764
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media distorts our relationship to </v>

252
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:08.584
<v Speaker 1>powerful people as rather than lead us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to imitating them in our own lives and </v>

253
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we settle and become mere spectators.</v>

254
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.963
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard was worried that this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>make 19th century Europe devoid of </v>

255
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.580
<v Speaker 1>passion and individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

256
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.414
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't end well for Evelyn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually the superheroes all come </v>

257
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>together and use their collective power </v>
<v Speaker 1>for good.</v>

258
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.163
<v Speaker 1>Both stopping Evelyn's plan and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process restoring the world's faith in </v>

259
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.534
<v Speaker 1>the goodness of superheroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notably Winston is pushed to action </v>

260
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:38.344
<v Speaker 1>during the final act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just using his massive resources to </v>

261
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:41.644
<v Speaker 1>change the world for the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by actually risking his own life to </v>

262
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>save the lives of others.</v>

263
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.953
<v Speaker 1>Just like in the first film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that true heroics isn't just </v>

264
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:51.034
<v Speaker 1>flexing one's power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about doing the right thing at the </v>

265
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>right time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pull.</v>

266
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:55.874
<v Speaker 1>One more example from aristotle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that justice was completed </v>

267
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>virtue as true justice is working for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good of another.</v>

268
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both films show that True Heroes Exhibit</v>

269
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.423
<v Speaker 1>this type of justice as their power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>at its most virtuous when it's used in </v>

270
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:11.834
<v Speaker 1>service of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have a final critique of randy </v>

271
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and thought in violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Final words during Evelyn's arrest.</v>

272
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

273
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:21.680
<v Speaker 1>she's rich and we'll probably get no </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a slap on the wrist because at</v>

274
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metro Ville is like our own world.</v>

275
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And access to wealth is the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>superpower.</v>

276
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And while Randy and objectivist would </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastically agreed,</v>

277
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.240
<v Speaker 1>violet is pointing out the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>injustice in this type of system.</v>

278
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.343
<v Speaker 1>So there you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What some see as a pair of films at the </v>

279
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Randy and slams are in fact asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial questions about power,</v>

280
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:43.843
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the forces in our world that have </v>

281
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 1>power over our attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

282
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>And just in case you still need to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto some sort of objective truth.</v>

283
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Just listen to what Mr incredible has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say about math.</v>

284
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Why would they change math?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Math is math is math.</v>

285
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.803
<v Speaker 1>Or if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share your own truth with the world by </v>
