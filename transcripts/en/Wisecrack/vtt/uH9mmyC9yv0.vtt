00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by wix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.433
<v Speaker 1>Jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always getting requests from fans </v>

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have got the cover.</v>

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Insert movie TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video game,</v>

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>mean book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sarcastic joke here.</v>

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
<v Speaker 1>We'll then enthusiastically watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brainstorm for a really long time and </v>

7
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.834
<v Speaker 1>often come up empty handed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that we can't think of </v>

8
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show might hint at ideas,</v>

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but not fully developed them or evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps coming up refuting our argument or</v>

10
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a show was just plain </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconsistent or hey,</v>

11
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're just too dumb to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So when it came time to look at Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>is surreal.</v>

13
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Retro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Futuristic Love Story.</v>

14
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.453
<v Speaker 1>We didn't quite get where we hoped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We dug and dug and found some really </v>

15
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.344
<v Speaker 1>cool stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a cohesive philosophy of not quite </v>

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to do something a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.433
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go through the ideas we </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered show how and when they work </v>

18
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.034
<v Speaker 1>within the context of the show and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>we ultimately decided not to go with it </v>

19
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.773
<v Speaker 1>and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this will serve as a foundation </v>

20
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>for you to think about the show in new </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>This is another experiment for us,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alright guys,</v>

33
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>so first a quick recap is an order wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>me luck.</v>

34
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Maniac primarily focuses on Owen milgrom</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Annie Landsberg.</v>

35
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the schizophrenia.</v>

36
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.443
<v Speaker 1>Black sheep of a very wealthy family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles with delusions of saving the </v>

37
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>world and a made up brother and a broker</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a dysfunctional family,</v>

38
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:56.634
<v Speaker 1>struggles with drug addiction to cope </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the death of her sister and the </v>

39
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>estrangement of her mother.</v>

40
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.643
<v Speaker 1>They enter a highly experimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical study run by three </v>

41
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:05.154
<v Speaker 1>doctors and a supercomputer called dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hopes to eradicate psychological </v>

42
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.821
<v Speaker 1>pain by having patients identify map and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately confront their issues through</v>

43
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>drug induced fantasies nd and Owen's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wires get crossed,</v>

44
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.803
<v Speaker 1>causing them to inhabit each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies where they experienced whole </v>

45
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>lifetimes together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerd.</v>

46
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.973
<v Speaker 1>He gets depressed up to the death of Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morimoto threatening the experiment and </v>

47
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the subjects inside the final fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any comforts.</v>

48
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.614
<v Speaker 1>The computer finds the resolve to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>past her sister's death while Owen </v>

49
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:35.814
<v Speaker 1>confronts the fact that his fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother is just an idealized version of </v>

50
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:39.774
<v Speaker 1>his crappy real brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saves the other patients and back in </v>

51
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:43.284
<v Speaker 1>the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finds the confidence to stand up to his </v>

52
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.074
<v Speaker 1>family and the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any friendship inspires Owen to escape </v>

53
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.794
<v Speaker 1>from a psych ward and have faith in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to function or was that a </v>

54
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:54.774
<v Speaker 1>fantasy?</v>

55
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now onto the pitches organized from best</v>

56
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>to worst for your entertainment pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Don Quixote.</v>

57
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>This one is an eight out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost good enough for video.</v>

58
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Miguel de Savantas is modern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic is everywhere in Maniac.</v>

59
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the fantasy scenarios even </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolves around one nanny infiltrating a</v>

60
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>seance to find the fictional last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>final chapter of the novel.</v>

61
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So why this focus on an old book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:20.404
<v Speaker 1>let's break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Quixote tells the story of Alonzo </v>

63
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.893
<v Speaker 1>Cayetano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who become so obsessed with books about </v>

64
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>chivalry that his mind dries out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

65
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.093
<v Speaker 1>he goes mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes this line extra ironic at </v>

66
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.063
<v Speaker 1>this time is I am healthy andy now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy people read books inspired by </v>

67
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>his books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alonzo decides to become a knight errant</v>

68
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.624
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bulk of the book follows him as he </v>

69
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:45.874
<v Speaker 1>goes on wild adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the one where he famously </v>

70
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>attacks windmills.</v>

71
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>He mistakes as giant windmills happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the name of maniacs.</v>

72
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.764
<v Speaker 1>Second episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which briefly features and looking at </v>

73
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>some during the road trip that ends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>her sister's death,</v>

74
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>but trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets deeper than that already.</v>

75
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:01.924
<v Speaker 1>We can draw a parallel between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness that makes don quixote one to </v>

76
00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:05.324
<v Speaker 1>perform heroic acts and Owen </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia that makes him believe </v>

77
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that he will save the world like Don </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quixote.</v>

78
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can't distinguish reality from </v>

79
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more than that,</v>

80
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:15.214
<v Speaker 1>Don Quixote inhabits a dreamlike </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindspace that makes castles of ens and </v>

81
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:24.481
<v Speaker 1>giants of windmills turning the regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>world into a fantastic one.</v>

82
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ULP treatment turns its patients sad</v>

83
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>realities into fully fledged fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures,</v>

84
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>and he's Lemur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Painting becomes a bizarre recovered.</v>

85
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The lemur story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The copy of Don Quixote,</v>

86
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>she picks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the steel.</v>

87
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.184
<v Speaker 1>The final chapter plot Andy and Lee </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a lord of the rings esque show </v>

88
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.534
<v Speaker 1>becomes this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Owen's hawk that kills Ernie verbal </v>

89
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>inspires the save the world from alien's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>

90
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>This is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Danny.</v>

91
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>If I wasn't secret agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would know I was a secret agent,</v>

92
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.423
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps the most powerful connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two works is the shared </v>

93
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>theme of transformation through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of dreams.</v>

94
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a hero.</v>

95
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.433
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the dons delusions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he adventures so that he may </v>

96
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>reinvigorate a golden age when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were more authentic,</v>

97
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>as he says bless at the time and blessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the centuries called by the ancients,</v>

98
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the Golden Age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that time women spoke their thoughts</v>

99
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:23.494
<v Speaker 1>of love from the soul simply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretentiously exactly as they thought </v>

100
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>them not searching for elaborate verbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumlocutions to beautify them,</v>

101
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>truth and simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're unmixed with fraud,</v>

102
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:34.444
<v Speaker 1>deceit and malice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice remained firm and sure either </v>

103
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>troubled nor offended against by </v>
<v Speaker 1>patronage and self interest as today.</v>

104
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>She is so grievously tainted in troubled</v>
<v Speaker 1>and persecuted.</v>

105
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Judges did not feel themselves as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do today entitled to be tyrants.</v>

106
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.703
<v Speaker 1>If Don Quixote's fantasies represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>his yearning for the days when people </v>

107
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.724
<v Speaker 1>weren't full of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one could say the ulp uses fantasy </v>

108
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>to heal a society that has been defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>by isolation.</v>

109
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.833
<v Speaker 1>As James suggest at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all levels of physics require collision </v>

110
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>and bonding in order to progress and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>does the human heart,</v>

111
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>comradery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communion,</v>

112
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>

113
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>love what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lost without connection.</v>

114
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.660
<v Speaker 1>It's quite terrible alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

115
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the world were presented is one that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragically absent,</v>

116
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>meaningful connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

117
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.664
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Finklestein Donovan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first two episodes introduce a </v>

118
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:35.564
<v Speaker 1>vision of New York in which people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more alienated from each other than </v>

119
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.793
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the human interactions we </v>

120
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:41.834
<v Speaker 1>witness are purely transactional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is made quite literal with friend </v>

121
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>proxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a service that provides you with someone</v>

122
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.814
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be your friend for a fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using a service that gives you </v>

123
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends,</v>

124
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I have real friends.</v>

125
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.213
<v Speaker 1>This is just more convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's ad buddy where a human </v>

126
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>being pitches you a product in exchange </v>
<v Speaker 1>for goods and services.</v>

127
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like getting free content </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>

128
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:07.454
<v Speaker 1>but having to watch annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There even appears to be a market for </v>

129
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>people to escape the world entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter a void,</v>

130
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.883
<v Speaker 1>a box that basically allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hibernate your life away instead of </v>

131
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>engaging with the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also lines like this.</v>

132
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for braving the outside world </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and the fact that a zoomy and </v>

133
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.444
<v Speaker 1>James Sleep in isolating drawers be </v>
<v Speaker 1>encroachment of consumerism into every </v>

134
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:31.214
<v Speaker 1>facet of our lives is further emphasized</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the omnipresence of advertisements </v>

135
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 1>from the ads that purchased Annie's face</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the neon signs blaring through Owen's</v>

136
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>window to ad copy on bridges and maniacs</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

137
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't even take a shower without </v>
<v Speaker 1>being bludgeoned by ads.</v>

138
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.943
<v Speaker 1>So Don Quixote uses fantasy to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>back an ideal era of authentic </v>

139
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>expression and maniac portrays to lonely</v>
<v Speaker 1>souls,</v>

140
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 1>finding connection through fantasy in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>era of isolation.</v>

141
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.503
<v Speaker 1>You don't do this.</v>

142
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.373
<v Speaker 1>I will do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that in many of </v>

143
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>the ulp fantasies taking place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real world,</v>

144
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.853
<v Speaker 1>all the creepy retro futurist stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to disappear when trying to save </v>

145
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 1>her Lemur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

146
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>the world goes from what the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

147
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>The two thousands would look like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the eighties,</v>

148
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's an important qualification </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mention here.</v>

149
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.660
<v Speaker 1>This golden age that Don Quixote waxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetic about never really happened.</v>

150
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>There are many characters in the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>who've been mown the negative effects of</v>

151
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:33.464
<v Speaker 1>chivalry books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deeming them trash and assuring people </v>

152
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that there was never such an idyllic </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

153
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.793
<v Speaker 1>I can swear to you that in fact this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world has never seen a single one of </v>

154
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:44.324
<v Speaker 1>those nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor any of their grandkids or their </v>

155
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:47.414
<v Speaker 1>stupidities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then don quixote is tricked into </v>

156
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:50.324
<v Speaker 1>hanging up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is lance and becoming Alonzo k Hondo </v>

157
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:52.934
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually renounces his madness and </v>

158
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>dies a quiet death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

159
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.243
<v Speaker 1>Annie ends up rejecting dirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered to stay in the fantasy world </v>

160
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.554
<v Speaker 1>with her sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She accepts reality and together with </v>

161
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Owen moves forward confidently.</v>

162
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.043
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this is that although </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that Annie's break from </v>

163
00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:17.720
<v Speaker 1>fantasy is considered a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>development for her character,</v>

164
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>there's more ambiguity surrounding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion of Glencoe take.</v>

165
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.543
<v Speaker 1>Are we supposed to agree with the bulk </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the characters in the book who </v>

166
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:27.650
<v Speaker 1>claimed that fantasy has done nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>but make him a fool?</v>

167
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Is it good that he's no longer out </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventuring or should we look at it like</v>

168
00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:33.464
<v Speaker 1>don't Antonio Moreno who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may God forgive you for the damage </v>

169
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:37.364
<v Speaker 1>you've done to the whole rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and trying to cure the wittiest </v>

170
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:42.800
<v Speaker 1>lunatic ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see my dear sir,</v>

171
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that whatever utility there might be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>curing him,</v>

172
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it could never match the pleasure he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives with his madness.</v>

173
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.110
<v Speaker 1>So why wasn't this made into a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>video?</v>

174
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite these really great connections,</v>

175
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 1>what else is there to say that reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is better than being a mcmurphy?</v>

176
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.230
<v Speaker 1>That fantasy is a liberating force for </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

177
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>such an exhilarating experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the connection between the</v>

178
00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:05.714
<v Speaker 1>two works is that they both vaguely deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the nature of fantasy versus </v>

179
00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:09.344
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in a way that could really </v>

180
00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:14.870
<v Speaker 1>provide a definitive philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis pitch to Mommy,</v>

181
00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Daddy and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

182
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.253
<v Speaker 1>I give this one a five out of 10 uptop </v>
<v Speaker 1>we should mention owens name is Sergei </v>

183
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.393
<v Speaker 1>milgrom is a reference to the milgram </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment in which subjects were given </v>

184
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:25.754
<v Speaker 1>the ability to electrocute people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to harm them under the </v>

185
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:30.950
<v Speaker 1>suggestion of an authority figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty cool.</v>

186
00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:31.784
<v Speaker 1>Shout out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't really see how it connected </v>

187
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.424
<v Speaker 1>to any of the events in the series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also some serious freud and </v>

188
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:39.670
<v Speaker 1>undertones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James is a pair of fillic,</v>

189
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.870
<v Speaker 1>meaning he's attracted to inanimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>

190
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.350
<v Speaker 1>You also has a strange relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother.</v>

191
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.013
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we want to get all oedipal and we </v>

192
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oedipal triangle of mother,</v>

193
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:56.360
<v Speaker 1>father and child seemed to be important </v>
<v Speaker 1>for many of the main characters and he's</v>

194
00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>mother walked out on her father.</v>

195
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.023
<v Speaker 1>Owen's dad is an overbearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascist and mantle ray also without a </v>

196
00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:06.950
<v Speaker 1>father in his life near drove my father </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and you slept in my bed,</v>

197
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:07.784
<v Speaker 1>way too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally goes blind after confronting </v>

198
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't see,</v>

199
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.553
<v Speaker 1>not so different than say a tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure who stabs his eyes out after </v>

200
00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:17.174
<v Speaker 1>romancing is madre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also built a computer model on its </v>

201
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:20.684
<v Speaker 1>mother's mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while that's not in the Greek </v>

202
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 1>tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems pertinent.</v>

203
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.953
<v Speaker 1>The computer is you play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ulp test also functions on the idea </v>

204
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 1>that our mental ailments can mostly be </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributed to some unresolved trauma.</v>

205
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.553
<v Speaker 1>For Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of our neuroses and mental health </v>

206
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:38.984
<v Speaker 1>problems were brought on by unresolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma that we must work through the </v>

207
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>three stages of the ULP treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a similar approach,</v>

208
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:45.824
<v Speaker 1>but with the mapping and confrontations </v>
<v Speaker 1>ages being more fantasy lives and less </v>

209
00:11:49.431 --> 00:11:51.110
<v Speaker 1>laying on the couch talking about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

210
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.213
<v Speaker 1>but the connection we really wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make was to a pair of thinkers who were </v>

211
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.534
<v Speaker 1>strongly opposed to Freud's method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher gl to lose and his </v>

212
00:11:58.871 --> 00:11:59.704
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst sidekick Felix squats are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the three things that got our spidey </v>

213
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.084
<v Speaker 1>sense is tingling were one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of the term arborization to </v>

214
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 1>describe the method they use to map the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain too.</v>

215
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 1>There are bonds I trees everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

216
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.403
<v Speaker 1>the opening monologue suggests that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and life are a chaotic series </v>

217
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.753
<v Speaker 1>of collisions for Dilas and watery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dominant way of thinking about the </v>

218
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 1>world is arborescent that is resembling </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tree.</v>

219
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.063
<v Speaker 1>We often think about history and society</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tree starting at a trunk and </v>

220
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 1>growing in a mostly linear fashion while</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally branching,</v>

221
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but the laws in Guata re preferred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another natural metaphor.</v>

222
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.763
<v Speaker 1>The rhizomes rhizomes are the roots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants like ginger or weeds like </v>

223
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.384
<v Speaker 1>dandelions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The important thing about rhizomes is </v>

224
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:45.964
<v Speaker 1>that they look like a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections with no visible starting </v>

225
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say the roots of a tree.</v>

226
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.173
<v Speaker 1>Basically the world is too complex to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood linearly and instead of </v>

227
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 1>simple cause and effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's inputs,</v>

228
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 1>outputs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loops,</v>

229
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of chaos that we barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

230
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>So why does this matter for maniac?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

231
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 1>in some cases we could view the opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>monologue under this framework.</v>

232
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.203
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't so much a straight line as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a chaotic assortment of random </v>

233
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>connections like the structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhizome.</v>

234
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>The crossing of wires for Owen and Andy </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of follow this logic,</v>

235
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.573
<v Speaker 1>the straight line of their computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connections are interrupted by a random </v>

236
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:25.444
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonsai trees in theory would be an </v>

237
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.503
<v Speaker 1>interesting addition to the symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it defined by linearity and </v>

238
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:32.824
<v Speaker 1>branching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that branching is intentionally </v>

239
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 1>guided by a human hand.</v>

240
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.573
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we could say that the show ends up</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the middle between being </v>

241
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.563
<v Speaker 1>totally chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhizome and the guided branching of the </v>

242
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.804
<v Speaker 1>bonsai tree after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he starts the show saying there is </v>

243
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:50.164
<v Speaker 1>no plan or pattern to the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just gas and ends the show saying </v>

244
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.670
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is assigned friend parks,</v>

245
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.443
<v Speaker 1>maybe the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we ultimately abandoned this idea </v>

246
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:02.344
<v Speaker 1>because we couldn't find any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that linked the bonsai trees to the </v>

247
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.350
<v Speaker 1>couple times that chaos versus order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>referenced.</v>

248
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 1>We had a few other clues to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they went nowhere.</v>

249
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dullas and quaternary are well known for</v>

250
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:14.854
<v Speaker 1>their Book Antietam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which challenges people who sought to </v>

251
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:18.244
<v Speaker 1>analyze the world in Freudian terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically they wanted to break free </v>

252
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>of the oedipal triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mommy,</v>

253
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and me and mantle ray after interpreting</v>

254
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 1>his blindness as a symptom of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother's behaviors,</v>

255
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.393
<v Speaker 1>rejects this Freud and framing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepts that it was instead brought on </v>

256
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:35.320
<v Speaker 1>by a kiss from a zoomy.</v>

257
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>There's also this probably random </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidence,</v>

258
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>felix squat to rewrote a screenplay </v>
<v Speaker 1>called a love of you Iq,</v>

259
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.143
<v Speaker 1>which actually sounds kind of like ulp </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a subatomic consciousness than </v>

260
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:52.381
<v Speaker 1>inhabits a computer and falls in love </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a human plus and watery use.</v>

261
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Schizophrenia as a model to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world where our desires.</v>

262
00:14:56.421 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>We're not limited by the confines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society or say capitalism and yeah,</v>

263
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:02.084
<v Speaker 1>maniacs shows a kind of dystopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and there's a guy with </v>

264
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't quite work.</v>

265
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Pitch three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Owens schizophrenia.</v>

266
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's the worst now opposed to the </v>

267
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.813
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] notion of schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we need to say is not exactly </v>

268
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:16.994
<v Speaker 1>literal to the medical condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Frederick Jameson's rebuttal to </v>

269
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:20.714
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamieson suggests that when people are </v>

270
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:23.084
<v Speaker 1>so bombarded with commercial images and </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages about who they can be or how a </v>

271
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>product will make them into this or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

272
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 1>they're actually imposing competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas of identity onto them.</v>

273
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.243
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this causes a perpetually shifting </v>

274
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 1>identity or a schizophrenia subject and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more ones identity vacillates,</v>

275
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the more one consumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

276
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>these schizophrenia subject is ideal for</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an economic system.</v>

277
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Mentees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's little doubt that the show hints</v>

278
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 1>at a causal connection between advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer capitalism and isolation,</v>

279
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.163
<v Speaker 1>but his maniac using Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in schizophrenia as a metaphor for the </v>

280
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 1>ils heaped upon the denizens of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopia.</v>

281
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely a stretch.</v>

282
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.493
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence we could point </v>

283
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:09.254
<v Speaker 1>to to make a confident case just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't come up with a cogent </v>

284
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 1>argument about the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grander messages doesn't mean it isn't a</v>

285
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:19.070
<v Speaker 1>good show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor does it mean it isn't a smart show.</v>

286
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 1>There are some extremely clever things </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

287
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.053
<v Speaker 1>The constant Easter egg references that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect the dreams not only to other </v>

288
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to real life,</v>

289
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 1>to focus on how narrative builds meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our lives.</v>

290
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.373
<v Speaker 1>This makes sense and the small details </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end that make us question the </v>

291
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>validity of the real world above others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it like when the the Lemur.</v>

292
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 1>What makes maniacs so impressive is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>daring visual aesthetic.</v>

293
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.923
<v Speaker 1>It's formless structure and it's regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>dips into absurdity and for that we </v>

294
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:52.574
<v Speaker 1>can't help but admire it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sticks to a relatively simple </v>

295
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:56.174
<v Speaker 1>thematic base and runs with it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people need connection and it's our </v>

296
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 1>ability to bond that can give us hope to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat our demons.</v>

297
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.783
<v Speaker 1>That's all for now.</v>
