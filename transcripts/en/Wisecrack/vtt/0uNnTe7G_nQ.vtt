00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.273
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Diversity is a pretty new term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very grateful for it.</v>

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.673
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets to something that is absolutely </v>

4
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.680
<v Speaker 1>real and has been harder to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it existed.</v>

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.143
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I have a perfect </v>

6
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:21.884
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It recognizes the fact that we are not </v>

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are not all identical,</v>

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>that we have a variation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of brands,</v>

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>of connectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of aptitudes,</v>

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.223
<v Speaker 1>of weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of blind spots and of sensitivities and </v>

11
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>of capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People on the autism spectrum who are,</v>

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>who are very functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.323
<v Speaker 1>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to have extraordinary analytical </v>

14
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:54.581
<v Speaker 1>skills and also often actually insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>into social interactions.</v>

15
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>So long as they're not the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>participating.</v>

16
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have an eye.</v>

17
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:01.654
<v Speaker 1>I've had a number of autistic students </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually point out to me dynamics that </v>

18
00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>were emerging in classrooms that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't yet seen.</v>

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And that once they were pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see a,</v>

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>and these are the same students who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very hard time.</v>

21
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.623
<v Speaker 1>You're recognizing when it is or is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to speak or get up or walk through </v>

22
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:17.864
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the classroom and such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of ways to be </v>

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.083
<v Speaker 1>neurodiverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have names for some conditions that </v>

24
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>actually represent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>ends of continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dyslexia is,</v>

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>these are going to sound like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of left field,</v>

28
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:36.404
<v Speaker 1>but colorblindness left handedness in </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those cases being what in </v>

29
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology we call the non </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant phenotype.</v>

30
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

31
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

32
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>that's the one of those that I belong to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a group.</v>

33
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.433
<v Speaker 1>And about 10% of people across all </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures that have been studied are </v>

34
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 1>lefthanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a persistent,</v>

35
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare phenotype,</v>

36
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>which suggests that it's adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's persistent,</v>

37
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:05.774
<v Speaker 1>it's complex and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it provides the different wiring of the </v>

38
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>brain associated with being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lefthander,</v>

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provides benefit in the social group in </v>

40
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>which lefthander show up.</v>

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.083
<v Speaker 1>We can put together analyses for why </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a lefthander might allow you to </v>

42
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:24.704
<v Speaker 1>approach a physical problem differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That a right hander would have a harder </v>

43
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:27.644
<v Speaker 1>time solving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the different wiring of the brain </v>

44
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 1>allows for different approaches as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar with colorblindness,</v>

45
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>that it might be really easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just is going to give you some,</v>

47
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.093
<v Speaker 1>some ability to see past color and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see patterns that aren't color-based </v>

48
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect that there's wiring in the</v>

49
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:46.724
<v Speaker 1>brain that is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>colorblindness that also allows for </v>

50
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>enhanced abilities that are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>from those who are colors cited.</v>

51
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Dyslexia for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

52
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.063
<v Speaker 1>Dyslexia is obviously a very modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition because writing is a very </v>

53
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>modern condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as an evolutionary biologist,</v>

54
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>when I say modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean thousands of years.</v>

55
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dyslexia is modern in terms of </v>

56
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

57
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>language was always about sound and </v>

58
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>never about writing until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

59
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>the lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability,</v>

60
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>it's almost never an inability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lesson,</v>

61
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.464
<v Speaker 1>the ability to process written symbols </v>
<v Speaker 1>into meaning in your head looks to me </v>

62
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.243
<v Speaker 1>like it's in trade off relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to engage in real time in </v>

63
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.174
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not to say that all of us </v>

64
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>can't learn through practice to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at any number of these skills,</v>

65
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.883
<v Speaker 1>but that being born with what the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>has is calling a deficit is almost </v>

66
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:45.634
<v Speaker 1>always going to exist in trade off </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with some often hidden </v>

67
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.700
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strength.</v>

68
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
