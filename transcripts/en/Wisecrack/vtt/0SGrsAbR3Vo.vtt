00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the power of images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2
00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be a photographer.</v>

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe in the power of images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an immediacy to an image</v>

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>that obviously text or writing doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>They both are incredibly powerful tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they hit you at different moments.</v>

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:17.124
<v Speaker 1>So an image that can speak to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>really can bring them to that place or </v>

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.733
<v Speaker 1>transport them to that moment of pain or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that moment of urgency or whatever that </v>

8
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>emotion is I'm trying to convey in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.283
<v Speaker 1>I think that an image has the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the viewer there immediately </v>

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like I walk into a scene and</v>

12
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:43.404
<v Speaker 1>I kind of look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I do is look at the </v>

13
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>light and I figure out where is light </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the light source and where is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling?</v>

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>And then I look at the expressions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and their faces and I'm trying to</v>

16
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:56.484
<v Speaker 1>think about what is the story I'm trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell or what is the story that's </v>

17
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>being conveyed to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I have to look for details.</v>

18
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.594
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for sort of anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be interesting or might sort of </v>

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>convey a message and I often kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle around that seen several times,</v>

20
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>so I'll look at it from the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the side,</v>

21
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:15.804
<v Speaker 1>from the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go around it a few times and see </v>

22
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>how the light changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's backlit,</v>

23
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>if I'm shooting straight on and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>often I'll shoot the hell out of it.</v>

24
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'll shoot it every which way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

25
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of very unconventional and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned to compose pictures,</v>

26
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>it was really trial and error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

27
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm often trying to fit a certain amount</v>

28
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.314
<v Speaker 1>of information into a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to tell a story with each </v>

29
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.914
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that has a lot to do with how I </v>

30
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>compose a picture and then I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it beautiful.</v>

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Not only even if it's a horrible scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

32
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>to sort of bring the viewer in and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them interested.</v>

33
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to take something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so horrendous or,</v>

34
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>or capture it in such a way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing they do is turn the page.</v>

35
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to engage the viewer.</v>
