00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>This video was sponsored by the purge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA network.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>What's up wise crack jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.684
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty big fans of the purge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were stoked when USA came to us </v>

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and gave us a sneak peek of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>two episodes of the new purge TV series,</v>

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>a 10 episode television event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesdays on USA network.</v>

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.623
<v Speaker 1>We've already discussed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic themes prevalent in the </v>

7
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:21.564
<v Speaker 1>purge films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the show has already shown some </v>

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>promise in extending these themes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some interesting ways.</v>

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you excited about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

10
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:29.574
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go through a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>key philosophical and sociological </v>

11
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>concepts to frame the way you watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without further ado,</v>

12
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:35.994
<v Speaker 1>welcome to this wise crack quick take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to know before you watch </v>

13
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.354
<v Speaker 1>the purge on USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we've discussed in our philosophy of </v>

14
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:42.654
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purge largely functions as an </v>

15
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.054
<v Speaker 1>extended metaphor for the way entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of people become disposable in </v>

16
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>our current economic environment.</v>

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.503
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new founding fathers literally </v>

18
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:53.904
<v Speaker 1>specify one day out of the year the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich can eradicate the superfluous poor </v>

19
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>who are deemed economic burdens as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Revolutionary Dante Bishop says,</v>

20
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to just kill the poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>than to provide them with health care,</v>

21
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing,</v>

22
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.753
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also see how the purge can promote </v>

23
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>the interests of the well to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

24
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>We're actively profit off all the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first film,</v>

25
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the upper middle class San and family </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes bank selling home security systems</v>

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>to everyone in their gated community in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the purge TV show.</v>

27
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>All of this is still front and center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rich and well connected are throwing</v>

28
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:28.734
<v Speaker 1>parties from secured houses while </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is forced to fend for </v>

29
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the inner cities.</v>

30
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.753
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the TV series is that </v>

31
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it explores how order emerges in an ard.</v>

32
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that sounds confusing,</v>

33
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>just stick with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider how the purge is basically the </v>

34
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:50.871
<v Speaker 1>temporary suspension of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's laws and norms and institutions all</v>

35
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>go out the window once the clock strikes</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

36
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>But in the TV show we see how even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anarchy,</v>

37
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of social bonds will </v>
<v Speaker 1>arise amidst the anarchic murder.</v>

38
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Thon one of those seedlings of order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a market,</v>

39
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>a means for people to exchange goods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

40
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>This one just exists for only 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the purchase always been lucrative,</v>

41
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so far we've mostly seen profit that</v>

42
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>happens before or after the purge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like home security systems,</v>

43
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance.</v>

44
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.383
<v Speaker 1>You get the idea in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see how people coordinate actions by </v>

45
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>skipping the brute force and using good </v>
<v Speaker 1>old fashioned cash.</v>

46
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.943
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned many cab drivers work on </v>

47
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:31.284
<v Speaker 1>perch night to take advantage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surge pricing and how we're going all </v>

48
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

49
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>You passing guys do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's driving around crazy.</v>

50
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard surge money elsewhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassin takes contracts to kill people,</v>

51
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.383
<v Speaker 1>but only during the hours in which it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal is conspiracy to commit murder </v>

52
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>still a crime if the murder happens on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the purge.</v>

53
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.653
<v Speaker 1>And do you declare that on a 10 99 well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I digress with all the poor people the </v>

54
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.274
<v Speaker 1>purchase got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a lot more capital just </v>

55
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the pockets of the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>founding fathers.</v>

56
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Big Wigs that us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we follow a couple going to an nff,</v>

57
00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>a purge party for the sole purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomaching,</v>

58
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:04.984
<v Speaker 1>the brutal in difference of the elites </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to Schmooze and NFFA party </v>

59
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:08.914
<v Speaker 1>member to invest in their new projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no doubt we'll probably see a fair </v>

60
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>amount of insider trading happening at </v>
<v Speaker 1>these 1% or purge parties.</v>

61
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.163
<v Speaker 1>So money is one way to organize things </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of beating people to get what </v>

62
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

63
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
<v Speaker 1>Markets can facilitate exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's one other way that TV show </v>

64
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>explores order amidst the anarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social contracts at its core,</v>

65
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:30.094
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a social contract does that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we sacrifice certain rights to enjoy </v>

66
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.114
<v Speaker 1>living in a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if I want to steal candy from </v>

67
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:37.654
<v Speaker 1>the children as a hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to give up this past time to </v>

68
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:40.894
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not living in the purge for 365 days a </v>

69
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purge films of largely emphasize the</v>

70
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>way humanity acts when the law is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended,</v>

71
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>when the social contract ceases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the clock strikes seven and without</v>

72
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:54.154
<v Speaker 1>threat of legal retribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people revert to their primal selves as </v>

73
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:57.964
<v Speaker 1>they release the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a specific narrative of human </v>

74
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.174
<v Speaker 1>nature proposed by philosopher Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbs to theorize that before </v>

75
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.074
<v Speaker 1>governments came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life was basically the Beta version of </v>

76
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a narrative to purge.</v>

77
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.313
<v Speaker 1>Franchise has been challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been in the first purge or the </v>

78
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>government needed to sow discord to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>people hyped about murder nine.</v>

79
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.843
<v Speaker 1>While the show certainly has strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of a hobby and war of all </v>

80
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>against all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite so simple,</v>

81
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.773
<v Speaker 1>rather than everyone reverting to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly natural and violet selves </v>

82
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>without the threat of below man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that most people just want to get</v>

83
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.784
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many employed the purge altogether and </v>

84
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>even within the purge we see a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social contract starting to emerge.</v>

85
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paramedics are left alone not because of</v>

86
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>some law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather as a social norm.</v>

87
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Safe with us were off limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm renting person.</v>

88
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.813
<v Speaker 1>Others signed literal contracts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forfeit their rights to purge as they </v>

89
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:56.850
<v Speaker 1>attend parties or pull all nighters in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lockdown office buildings.</v>

90
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.903
<v Speaker 2>Once the Burj begins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his 38th floor will be locked out as a </v>

91
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.303
<v Speaker 2>safety security on all workers including</v>
<v Speaker 2>the both of you have signed waivers </v>

92
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 2>giving up their rights to purge on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor for the entire evening.</v>

93
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.953
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see a bar that suspends all purging </v>

94
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 1>privileges based only out of mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

95
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Slash sphere for the owner of the bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat like hops is Leviathan,</v>

96
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 1>but unwritten laws in the form of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>norms aren't always so rosy.</v>

97
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.163
<v Speaker 1>The show looks at the darker side as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman having worked her ass off for </v>

98
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:29.910
<v Speaker 1>years is teased with the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make partner at her prestigious firm,</v>

99
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.013
<v Speaker 1>but the unspoken rule that to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress is her unwillingness to </v>

100
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Speaker 1>reciprocate her bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creepy propositions,</v>

101
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.393
<v Speaker 1>although he hasn't come out and set it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knows the only thing standing </v>

102
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:45.030
<v Speaker 1>between her and her dream is her </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to put out.</v>

103
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.163
<v Speaker 1>We're only two episodes in the seeing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>beholds 10 episode series focuses on </v>

104
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:50.454
<v Speaker 1>purge tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can definitely expect to see more </v>

105
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>commentaries on human nature in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos.</v>

106
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So thanks again to the purge on USA </v>
<v Speaker 1>network for sponsoring this video.</v>

107
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave you guys for the list</v>

108
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>of things I would do during a purge </v>
<v Speaker 1>import exotic pets.</v>

109

<v Speaker 1>worth of fireworks.</v>

112

<v Speaker 1>sidewalk.</v>

113
