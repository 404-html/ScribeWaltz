<v Speaker 1>avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity war explores what happens when </v>

48
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>power is allowed to grow unchecked like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing on your back.</v>

49
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I've been meaning to ask you about Karen</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ou fan.</v>

50
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Osu possesses many marks of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed evil kings such as a lazy boy.</v>

51
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>How is hated that chair lackeys who talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

52
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.863
<v Speaker 1>No other beings has ever had them might </v>
<v Speaker 1>ne the nobility wield not one to </v>

53
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>infinity stones and a jeweled gauntlet </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the king of Pop.</v>

54
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.263
<v Speaker 1>Mikael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also acts in accordance with the </v>

55
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.504
<v Speaker 1>principle of noblesse oblige the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobility is duty bound to perform </v>

56
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>certain social responsibilities like </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>

57
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a simple calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This universe is finite.</v>

58
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.550
<v Speaker 3>It's resources finite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If life has left,</v>

59
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 3>done shirked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life will cease to exist</v>

60
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and ain't calculus and I should know I </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed it twice.</v>

61
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.643
<v Speaker 1>This approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His sentiments from English scholar </v>

62
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.463
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Mouth is are slithering and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>essay on the principles of human </v>

63
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.034
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martha's are believe that population </v>

64
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.214
<v Speaker 1>could be contained through two methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proactive checks that increased </v>

65
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.084
<v Speaker 1>mortality rates and preventative checks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that decreased birth rates such as </v>

66
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>condoms and birkenstocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like any good movie villain,</v>

67
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Fenos chooses the option that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 1>more toy sales.</v>

68
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Fantas is a played Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invades plantings.</v>

69
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.593
<v Speaker 1>He takes what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wipes out half the population and </v>

70
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanatos employees,</v>

71
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:30.574
<v Speaker 1>the old utilitarian argument that moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices maximize happiness for the </v>

72
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.314
<v Speaker 1>maximum amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By this logic murdering half the </v>

73
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>population is preferable to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>population killing itself.</v>

74
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Speaker 3>You were in the bed hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scrounging for scraps.</v>

75
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Your planet was on the brink of </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse.</v>

76
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm the one who stopped that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's happened since then?</v>

77
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 3>The children born have known nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 3>full bellies and clear skies.</v>

78
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a paradise,</v>

79
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 1>although he could make the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice as big.</v>

80
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

81
00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:05.744
<v Speaker 1>the film criticizes both tennis's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unchecked might and his utilitarian </v>

82
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:10.154
<v Speaker 1>ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not his weird tunic and boot Combo </v>

83
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.903
<v Speaker 1>is quest for power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forces him to choose between ambition </v>

84
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and Familia.</v>

85
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 3>The hardest choices require the </v>
<v Speaker 3>strongest wounds.</v>

86
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.630
<v Speaker 1>While he achieves his goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs him everything he holds dear.</v>

87
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Namely his daughter who's tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder him on multiple occasions.</v>

88
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.373
<v Speaker 1>Earthlink cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Garrick's where I'm your lawyer and </v>

89
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>now a word from my weird intern.</v>

90
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gareth's is turn.</v>

91
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:38.814
<v Speaker 4>Jared here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friends are always asking me what </v>

92
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.600
<v Speaker 4>it's like to work for Garrick's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

93
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.870
<v Speaker 4>it can be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Technically I'm not even allowed to have</v>

94
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:46.704
<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that gets me through is </v>

95
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.624
<v Speaker 4>Garrick's is awesome collection of </v>
<v Speaker 4>vintage earth artifacts like his oculus </v>

96
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:52.734
<v Speaker 4>rift from 2018 back then it cost a mere </v>
<v Speaker 4>$399 but as fond of saying at dinner </v>

97
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 4>parties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's priceless.</v>

98
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Garrick's has tons of games too,</v>

99
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 4>including marvel powers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>united vr,</v>

100
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Lone Echo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brass tactics,</v>

101
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.124
<v Speaker 4>echo arena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it seems like he's always getting </v>

102
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>

103
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.963
<v Speaker 4>I'm forbidden to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Derek's busted me when I thought he </v>

104
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 4>was speaking at an intergalactic </v>
<v Speaker 4>convention of Earth of files.</v>

105
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.723
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm trapped down here in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>basement for what he describes as </v>

106
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 4>eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

107
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was worth it.</v>

108
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.473
<v Speaker 4>Check out the link in the video </v>
<v Speaker 4>description to get more info on how to </v>

109
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 4>pick up one of your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can time travel back to 2018 that</v>

110
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:29.714
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
