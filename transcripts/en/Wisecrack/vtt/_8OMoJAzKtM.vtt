00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>The Buddhist psychology tradition in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular and the Asian psychologies in</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:05.934
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually the engine Christian </v>

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:12.411
<v Speaker 1>monastic psychology's do have a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and a strong practice really,</v>

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of overcoming bitterness,</v>

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.033
<v Speaker 1>vengefulness and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carrying a little further for Moses has </v>

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>already restraining idea of an eye for </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eye and tooth for tooth.</v>

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.204
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't take a leg or a life for an </v>

9
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>or a life for it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

11
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just enough to do this,</v>

12
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.073
<v Speaker 1>which was already a step forward from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old engines idea of tribal attitude </v>

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.023
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jesus has in Buddha's greater idea </v>

14
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>of really love your enemies and how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpack that in a modern city.</v>

15
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And people get nervous about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think if you love your enemies,</v>

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>your meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means you're going to cave to them.</v>

17
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.843
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to invite them to come and </v>

18
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>destroy you and just be a masochist </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what.</v>

19
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.123
<v Speaker 1>And that is not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it means love means in the Asian </v>

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.933
<v Speaker 1>psychological term that I think really </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any term means the wish for the </v>

21
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>beloved happiness to want to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one you love happy.</v>

22
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what love really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't really greeted,</v>

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.883
<v Speaker 1>wished to possess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although some kinds of loves tend to </v>

24
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>tend to mix with that of the egotistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

25
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.463
<v Speaker 1>The reason someone is your enemy is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you are preventing their </v>

26
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow you have something they want,</v>

27
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>you're in their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

28
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>The world isn't big enough for the both </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you type of attitude.</v>

29
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.173
<v Speaker 1>And so they want to be your enemy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are unhappy and they think </v>

30
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>by getting rid of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will be happy.</v>

31
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>So if they were happy already without </v>
<v Speaker 1>messing with you,</v>

32
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they might be wanting to leave you alone</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's no fun to go attack people.</v>

33
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

34
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>it's an exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not like giving a caress or </v>
<v Speaker 1>receiving what so,</v>

36
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>so loving your enemies is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical advice.</v>

37
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And Martin Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

38
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>when he went back the second time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bridge in Birmingham,</v>

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>a John Lewis says that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was advised by his friends,</v>

40
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

41
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>don't get into how are we going to love </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

42
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.033
<v Speaker 1>those cops who were sicking dogs and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoses and beating us and jailing us and </v>

43
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>torturing us and that then Martin Luther</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

44
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King's that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too bitter.</v>

46
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>A burden to bear hatred and resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do love them.</v>

47
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.633
<v Speaker 1>Of course we opposed them and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>against them and we don't want them to </v>

48
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>behave like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't hate them.</v>

49
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>That's just a ridiculous waste of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

50
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.973
<v Speaker 1>And in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that being an enemy who has </v>

51
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.474
<v Speaker 1>hurt you has already hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go around nursing hatred and </v>

52
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>vindictiveness and how to get back at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

53
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you're hurting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you oppose your enemy who someone,</v>

54
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.243
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by,</v>

55
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>by saying your enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

56
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>they think they're your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully if you love your enemy,</v>

57
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you have no enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

58
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>when you oppose that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could do,</v>

59
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:50.664
<v Speaker 1>you could have tough love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have fierce compassion and when </v>

60
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>they sense that you're doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want their betterment actually,</v>

61
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not good them to be mean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and so on,</v>

62
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>then actually it has a little different </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge to it.</v>

63
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:04.984
<v Speaker 1>And for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to get them to see </v>

64
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a better chance they'll be able </v>

65
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.154
<v Speaker 1>to listen to you when they don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of hatred and a destructive </v>

66
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>vibration toward them coming through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

67
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>They know what's in the style and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy of his speech.</v>

68
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Your motivation will make it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
