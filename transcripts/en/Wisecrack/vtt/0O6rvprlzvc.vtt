00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared here.</v>

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.453
<v Speaker 1>And today we're talking about one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest and weirdest shows on </v>

4
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:12.634
<v Speaker 1>television Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes Atlanta so thought provoking </v>

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.323
<v Speaker 1>is that it's simultaneously one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most realistic and one of the most </v>

6
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:20.404
<v Speaker 1>surreal shows on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this seemingly contradictory </v>

7
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>combination that makes the show one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting and hilarious shows</v>

8
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this wise crack edition on</v>

9
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of Atlanta spoilers </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

10
00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And a lucky if you're watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's for you buddy.</v>

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick breakdown for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninitiated.</v>

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta has a simple premise earn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>princeton dropout,</v>

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.143
<v Speaker 1>needs to find a way to make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it links up with this cousin Alfred </v>

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.853
<v Speaker 1>Aka Paper Boi and becomes his manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the while he tries to balance his </v>

15
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.794
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the mother of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter Van and becomes friends with </v>

16
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Alfred's roommate darious.</v>

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.473
<v Speaker 1>But this simple premise is deceiving as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show which Creator Donald Glover </v>

18
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:58.884
<v Speaker 1>described as twin peaks with rappers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushes the boundaries of reality to </v>

19
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>insane links for both comedic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic effect.</v>

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And it accomplishes this by using both </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrealism and realism.</v>

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.123
<v Speaker 1>Let's begin by defining our terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realism is any set of restrictions to a </v>

22
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>creative work which demand that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>adhere to the dominant assumptions about</v>

23
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.494
<v Speaker 1>what is and isn't possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realism presents the world with minimal </v>

24
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>interference from the perspective of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>One of the best examples of contemporary</v>
<v Speaker 1>realism is the work of British filmmaker</v>

26
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.994
<v Speaker 1>Ken Loach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll use this as films to presents the </v>

27
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>gritty reality of British life without </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sugarcoating his most recent film,</v>

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.043
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Blake tells the story of a man </v>

29
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.054
<v Speaker 1>struggling to stay financially afloat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brutal bureaucracy of the British </v>

30
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>welfare state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unlike the typical Hollywood tale of</v>

31
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:45.944
<v Speaker 1>overcoming poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Blake dies alone in a bathroom </v>

32
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>stall before receiving justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike this harsh realism,</v>

33
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>surrealism pushes beyond the limits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

34
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.573
<v Speaker 1>If Ken loach uses the camera to show the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world precisely as it is someone like </v>

35
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>David Lynch uses it to create something </v>
<v Speaker 1>which exceeds our logical expectation.</v>

36
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also worth noting that most comedic</v>

37
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>television is neither realistic nor </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrealist,</v>

38
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>but simply fiction with no real claim to</v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity.</v>

39
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.303
<v Speaker 1>This is why it doesn't matter that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan of Seinfeld is just a </v>

40
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:21.664
<v Speaker 1>soundstage in Los Angeles or that Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 1>James could be married to three </v>

41
00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>different beautiful women into different</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBS shows.</v>

42
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.383
<v Speaker 1>Now that we're clear on the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get into the nitty gritty of </v>

43
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>surrealism with the Oji surrealists </v>
<v Speaker 1>Andre Norton,</v>

44
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.083
<v Speaker 1>who is to surrealism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What guy theory is to donkey sauce and </v>

45
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.434
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Barton was a French writer </v>

46
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:39.724
<v Speaker 1>working in the early 20th century who </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewed surrealism as both an artistic </v>

47
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.923
<v Speaker 1>and political tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways in which Proton </v>

48
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.743
<v Speaker 1>described surrealism is a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatism and its bigger state by week </v>

49
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>one proposal to express the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning of thought.</v>

50
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Have you haven't had your daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>microdose of Lsd yet?</v>

51
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.663
<v Speaker 1>Put Burton is saying is that surrealism </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses art to express what's really going </v>

52
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>on at both the personal and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

53
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Surrealist art might confuse us at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

54
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>but on the other side of this confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see the world in a new light.</v>

55
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>So how do you take an art form that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspires to exceed reality and combine it</v>

56
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>with an art form that takes the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite approach.</v>

57
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.353
<v Speaker 1>While let's find out first on realism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta makes a deliberate effort to </v>

58
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:23.974
<v Speaker 1>portray life in Atlanta accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for people struggling like </v>

59
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.993
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It removes the fictionalized glamour of </v>

60
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.921
<v Speaker 1>say a rap video and instead gives us the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes not so pleasant reality behind</v>

61
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:35.824
<v Speaker 1>the facade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take paper voice apartment while the </v>

62
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.314
<v Speaker 1>network originally wanted him to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that would fit the stereotype </v>

63
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:41.254
<v Speaker 1>of a rapper's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show puts him in a pretty standard </v>

64
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:44.224
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta apartment building or someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like paper boy would actually live or </v>

65
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>redmond</v>

66
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 2>got my eye and then boys right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know we are in on the floor or watch</v>

67
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:56.120
<v Speaker 2>tv at the same time,</v>

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.023
<v Speaker 1>he also is usually profusely sweating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Atlanta is king hot and anyone </v>

69
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>who had portrayed otherwise with makeup </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a liar.</v>

70
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earn lives in a storage unit and works a</v>

71
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:05.784
<v Speaker 1>series of odd jobs while trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a manager when they're in need of </v>

72
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:09.144
<v Speaker 1>sustenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paper Boi and dairy is don't just get </v>

73
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.184
<v Speaker 1>wings from an anonymous restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to Atlanta institution Jr </v>

74
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>crickets and ordered lemon pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wet wigs,</v>

75
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.633
<v Speaker 1>a regional staple not available outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the six seven eight and 404 area codes </v>

76
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.480
<v Speaker 1>major</v>

77
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.313
<v Speaker 2>and then couple of joints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These cocktail sauce on snap lemon </v>

78
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:28.554
<v Speaker 2>pepper wings.</v>

79
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.020
<v Speaker 1>This commitment to realism makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city of Atlanta a character in the show.</v>

80
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.170
<v Speaker 1>This stands in stark contrast to </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrealism.</v>

81
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.183
<v Speaker 1>While it's realism is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta's embrace of surrealism has </v>

82
00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:41.024
<v Speaker 1>produced its most memorable moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's been the Tele Sandwich guy </v>

83
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:44.864
<v Speaker 1>on the bus</v>

84
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 3>symptom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the way things necessarily the ship</v>

85
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>black student wearing white facing </v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

86
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>a strip club Dj speaking to earn.</v>

87
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 2>You'll just look at it Tipa what are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>going my man,</v>

88
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.380
<v Speaker 2>I said Chip Hook with that green jacket </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

89
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Whack ass cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool g shirt</v>

90
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.820
<v Speaker 1>or most things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darious does the careful.</v>

91
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cold.</v>

92
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta's world is full of seemingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical characters and events.</v>

93
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta often blends the surreal and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real together in the same scene,</v>

94
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.343
<v Speaker 1>including the one we just discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>after being told that the chef hooked </v>

95
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:35.464
<v Speaker 1>him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see a magical glow coming from the </v>

96
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:37.894
<v Speaker 1>wings showing the viewers from outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta precisely how magical and </v>

97
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:42.124
<v Speaker 1>revered these wings are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But often the use of surrealism can ask </v>

98
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>us to rethink what we take for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the season one episode,</v>

99
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>nobody beats the biebs paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boys playing a celebrity basketball game</v>

100
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>with the son of Justin Timberlake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Post Malone Justin Bieber.</v>

101
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of paper Boi dunking on Bieber </v>

102
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.064
<v Speaker 1>is perfect enough on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real twist comes when we see Justin </v>

103
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Bieber and he's well black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deal,</v>

104
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>this is a clear subversion of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation and while this surreal,</v>

105
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.334
<v Speaker 1>this casting might seem confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates some wonderful comedic </v>

106
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a Buddha,</v>

107
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>others because Brian's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

108
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>But what's most important is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides being black,</v>

109
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.503
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin bieber acts just like the real </v>

110
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:24.974
<v Speaker 1>justin bieber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He treats reporters and fans like acts </v>

111
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.374
<v Speaker 1>like a spoiled Brat has a huge entourage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can't fathom the idea of anyone </v>

112
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>getting more attention than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After acting like an asshole for much of</v>

113
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>the episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaver holds a press conference where he</v>

114
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>apologizes for his behavior with the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>song</v>

115
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 1>thing that bieber actually did in real </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

116
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.773
<v Speaker 1>This surreal take on beavers very real </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior leaves the audience with a </v>

118
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:11.794
<v Speaker 1>crucial question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely what his behavior be perceived </v>

119
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he were black,</v>

120
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 1>black beaver would please Burton as he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>

121
00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>not just for surreal humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The forces,</v>

122
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.590
<v Speaker 1>the audience to rethink their </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions about reality.</v>

123
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.723
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does our culture forgive white </v>

124
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:27.094
<v Speaker 1>celebrities for bad behavior of while </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding celebrities of color to a </v>

125
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>different standard and even weirder </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of surrealism takes place in the</v>

126
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:34.444
<v Speaker 1>same episode while paper Boi and earn </v>
<v Speaker 1>are busy at the celebrity basketball </v>

127
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:37.954
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darious heads is local gun range to let </v>

128
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:42.190
<v Speaker 1>off some stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his range mates get pissed when they</v>

129
00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:44.560
<v Speaker 1>noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dairies says target poster isn't a human</v>

130
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 1>outline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead a picture of a dog,</v>

131
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:52.170
<v Speaker 1>this raises the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would shoot a dog target shoot dogs.</v>

132
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>We're not your second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we're forced to consider,</v>

133
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I shoot a human?</v>

134
00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:00.724
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that one.</v>

136
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.683
<v Speaker 1>This is way too specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a potential nod to white </v>

137
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>people's over the top obsession with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their dogs,</v>

138
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.560
<v Speaker 1>which nobody a wise crack from late to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

139
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a little bit.</v>

140
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I did not know people like dogs this </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

141
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I use of realism that is quite literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to see.</v>

142
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.423
<v Speaker 1>Takes place in episode eight of season </v>
<v Speaker 1>one in which earned darious and paper </v>

143
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.630
<v Speaker 1>boy are outside the club after strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>arming the club owner to get paid.</v>

144
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Just getting their money was a surreal </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavor in itself,</v>

145
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:28.390
<v Speaker 1>but things get even weirder once they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the parking lot.</v>

146
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.643
<v Speaker 1>In case you don't know what you just saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was an invisible car speeding </v>

147
00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:34.120
<v Speaker 1>through the parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving bodies in its weight.</v>

148
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.313
<v Speaker 1>Is this meant to be a commentary on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd ways that celebrities use their </v>

149
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>money to flex on everyone else?</v>

150
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.833
<v Speaker 1>Maybe could it be highlighting the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which we have become so desensitized </v>

151
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:44.794
<v Speaker 1>to violence that the only way to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand out is to use an invisible car </v>

152
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.753
<v Speaker 1>possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is this Atlanta at its most twin </v>

153
00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 1>peaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we shouldn't look for meaning at all</v>

154
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.093
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good reminder that surrealism </v>

155
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>doesn't always have to mean something as</v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

156
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's used to undermine and confuse our </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational impulse to project meaning onto</v>

157
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice condo.</v>

158
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.513
<v Speaker 1>The flip side of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless surrealism can be seen in </v>

159
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the most uncomfortable moments of</v>
<v Speaker 1>season one,</v>

160
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>the juneteenth party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case you're not up on your history.</v>

161
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:13.194
<v Speaker 1>Juneteenth is the holiday that </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrates the abolition of slavery in </v>

162
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:16.194
<v Speaker 1>Texas and in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emancipation of slaves throughout </v>

163
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:18.954
<v Speaker 1>the confederacy at the party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the husband of the host gives earn an </v>

164
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>impromptu lecture on the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting Africa.</v>

165
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.940
<v Speaker 2>That was a pilgrimage needed to pay my </v>
<v Speaker 2>respects.</v>

166
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Ask for forgiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

167
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

168
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't like you.</v>

169
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.740
<v Speaker 2>You've never been to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

170
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.420
<v Speaker 2>You gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your motherland.</v>

171
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.270
<v Speaker 2>What are you thinking</v>

172
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and predicts his ancestors via his </v>
<v Speaker 1>facial features,</v>

173
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivory Coast,</v>

174
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 2>southeastern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ben to region.</v>

175
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.603
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this spooky thing called </v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery happened and my entire ethnic </v>

176
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 2>identity was her race.</v>

177
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And to ensure that he is the platonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of that white guy.</v>

178
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.430
<v Speaker 1>He let it performs a poem about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrors of slavery.</v>

179
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Jim Crow has the name of a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it</v>

180
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.920
<v Speaker 2>ghost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a man,</v>

181
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.700
<v Speaker 1>but Jim Crow is haunting me liking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie poltergeist.</v>

182
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.853
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only white guy at the party </v>

183
00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:24.014
<v Speaker 1>celebrating the end of slavery performs </v>
<v Speaker 1>a poem about slavery from the </v>

184
00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 1>perspective of a black man,</v>

185
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.070
<v Speaker 2>let me slave ships</v>

186
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and to add salt to the rim of this Super</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awkward Margarita.</v>

187
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.430
<v Speaker 1>The parties bar offers fun cocktails </v>
<v Speaker 1>named after the horrors of slavery.</v>

188
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I have to plantation master poison</v>

189
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 1>and we couldn't talk about surrealism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Atlanta without covering the most.</v>

190
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:46.524
<v Speaker 1>Talked about episodes of season one b a </v>
<v Speaker 1>n the entire episode takes place during </v>

191
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.384
<v Speaker 1>a fictional talk show where paper boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>being grilled by a feminist sociologist </v>

192
00:10:54.651 --> 00:10:55.420
<v Speaker 1>for his lyric</v>

193
00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.270
<v Speaker 4>rap is tickets coming home to roost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My life is messed up.</v>

194
00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.890
<v Speaker 4>Y'All did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

195
00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:01.330
<v Speaker 4>That's black news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can look that up.</v>

196
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Well your news is problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

197
00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:03.994
<v Speaker 4>that ain't my fault.</v>

198
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.460
<v Speaker 1>The crown jewel of this episode is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>black teenager from Atlanta.</v>

199
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:10.820
<v Speaker 1>That self identifies as a 30 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>white man from Denver.</v>

200
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

201
00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 2>What Ipa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have one tack?</v>

202
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see game of thrones last night?</v>

203
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>This came on the heels of the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

204
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:20.544
<v Speaker 1>That was Rachel Dolezal and the ensuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates about trans racial identity </v>

205
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.263
<v Speaker 1>while the notion of a white person self </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying as black led to genuine </v>

206
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:28.194
<v Speaker 1>debate and consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta asks us to consider how we feel </v>

207
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:31.404
<v Speaker 1>about the issue when it's a black teen </v>
<v Speaker 1>self identifying as a white man and </v>

208
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:35.514
<v Speaker 1>paper voice responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that much of the audience likely </v>

209
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:38.394
<v Speaker 1>resonates with.</v>

210
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

211
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 4>This is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is dumb</v>

212
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.123
<v Speaker 1>and this might be the ultimate genius of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta as unlike other shows that have </v>

213
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>used surreal elements to take us further</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from reality.</v>

214
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.653
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta uses surrealism to bring our </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to reality by using the surreal to </v>

215
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:56.914
<v Speaker 1>disrupt the habitual way we look at and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about certain topics we can </v>

216
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:01.474
<v Speaker 1>reconsider them altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this in Clark County and his </v>

217
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:07.770
<v Speaker 1>hybrid music video slash commercial for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you who uh,</v>

218
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>blacks on the base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this seemingly surreal example of a</v>

219
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:12.004
<v Speaker 1>famous rapper making a song about an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial chocolate beverage exposes </v>

220
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.340
<v Speaker 1>something that's an actually going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Eve,</v>

221
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.183
<v Speaker 1>much of art produced in our day and age </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really just thinly veiled </v>

222
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 1>advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really need</v>

223
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.830
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

224
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.663
<v Speaker 1>This example resonates with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of Marxism one Burton as he </v>

225
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:38.370
<v Speaker 1>surreal moment leads to a sociopolitical</v>
<v Speaker 1>critique.</v>

226
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.383
<v Speaker 1>This use of surrealism for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique is what keeps Atlanta in the </v>

227
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:43.374
<v Speaker 1>spirit of protons work in both seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surrealism is used to reflect on </v>

228
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:50.070
<v Speaker 1>everything from inequality to cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation.</v>

229
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they before Christie grab go</v>

230
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.143
<v Speaker 1>and it refuses to let the viewer turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>off their TV without confronting </v>

231
00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:06.504
<v Speaker 1>something real and urgent about society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be the most unique </v>

232
00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:11.034
<v Speaker 1>contribution Atlanta has made to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary television in the same way </v>

233
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:17.250
<v Speaker 1>that an employee's surrealism without </v>
<v Speaker 1>veering into absurdity.</v>

234
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.210
<v Speaker 1>It also provides cultural commentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>without coming off as preachy.</v>

235
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Brandon Tartikoff,</v>

236
00:13:22.881 --> 00:13:27.380
<v Speaker 2>chairman of NBC entertainment and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a hit idea for the new fall season.</v>

237
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no hope when dope</v>

238
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:33.903
<v Speaker 1>and it's this commitment to pushing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of surrealism that gives us </v>

239
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the most insane moments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>television in recent memory.</v>

240
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

241
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.833
<v Speaker 1>Before we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth mentioning the aims of </v>

242
00:13:56.011 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Bhutan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrealism in relation to Atlanta,</v>

243
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 1>creator Donald Glover's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musical alter ego,</v>

244
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.403
<v Speaker 1>childish Gambino as Britain makes clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aim of surrealism is not simply to </v>

245
00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:06.384
<v Speaker 1>create a new form of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to use art to change culture can </v>

246
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:12.450
<v Speaker 1>revealing its true structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baton,</v>

247
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.313
<v Speaker 1>the world is only very relatively into </v>
<v Speaker 1>with thought meaning that much of what </v>

248
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:21.060
<v Speaker 1>we perceive isn't a true indicator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the world really is.</v>

249
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.283
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in this is America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're surreal elements are used to make </v>

250
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.820
<v Speaker 1>a scaling political critique of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>State of affairs in Contemporary America</v>

251
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.013
<v Speaker 1>and if this video is any indication it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like glover and his creative </v>

252
00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:34.434
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be continuing to push the limits </v>

253

<v Speaker 1>of a new black surrealism for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreseeable future and as always,</v>

256
