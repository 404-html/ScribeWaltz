00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on who you are,</v>

2
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:10.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>it's also shouldn't be a stressful </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

4
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>it could mean that you take your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.693
<v Speaker 1>the price chopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take your family to the farmer's </v>

9
00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>market once a week and you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a more expensive there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do some,</v>

11
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 1>some intelligent shopping and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>cook a little bit more at home.</v>

12
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're at the farmers market,</v>

14
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you're asking the farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>how is this pork raised and how is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

16
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.063
<v Speaker 1>what soil did this carrot growing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of carrot is at and all of </v>

17
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:38.044
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>

18
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has three different kinds of carrots </v>

19
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:40.624
<v Speaker 1>that he's growing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you come back the next season and </v>

20
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:42.954
<v Speaker 1>there's different carrots again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all of this becomes educational </v>

21
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inspiring.</v>

22
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and because of that more delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one point that's,</v>

26
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.903
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes gets lost in all this is </v>

27
00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:54.941
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>as chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>one of the great assets that we have are</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

30
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>these front of house staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's waiters to an end myself to,</v>

31
00:01:02.171 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell stories about what we're doing.</v>

32
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this food is coming from.</v>

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the story.</v>

34
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.573
<v Speaker 1>You lead to a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this association you were talking about </v>

35
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.551
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.384
<v Speaker 1>it's the story that separates the small </v>
<v Speaker 1>family farmer and even the midsize </v>

37
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Pharma from the big food chain because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all along the food chain,</v>

38
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from seed to farmer to trucker to </v>

39
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>distributor to marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Price is the determining factor.</v>

40
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.953
<v Speaker 1>But when you have a story from a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>family farm about a carat and about the </v>

41
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>soil it's growing in and what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmers,</v>

42
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 1>grandfather grew in that same soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a quick narrative like that,</v>

43
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you have something that's so unique and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

44
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious to people who want this kind </v>

45
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>of food and it informs their appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
