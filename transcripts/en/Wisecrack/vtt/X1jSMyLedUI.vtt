<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>skillshare.</v>

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack.</v>

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Jerod here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about the movie that</v>

4
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>made Batman v Superman look like an art </v>
<v Speaker 1>house masterpiece.</v>

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.573
<v Speaker 1>Justice League.</v>

6
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.000
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish it was that one.</v>

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically superfriends,</v>

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but still better than justice league.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>that's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So full disclosure,</v>

10
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>justice league is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's trite Aif I believe in truth,</v>

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also a big fan of justice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

12
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.450
<v Speaker 1>if that line didn't tip you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also totally botched superman.</v>

13
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Worst of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film neutered all the thematic </v>

14
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:37.834
<v Speaker 1>ambitions of its predecessor throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>these superman as Christ metaphor into </v>

15
00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>the trash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beneath all these flaws,</v>

16
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:44.704
<v Speaker 1>there's one central issue that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice League so forgettable after </v>

17
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>subjecting ourselves to all 121 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this film over and over again.</v>

18
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen it like five times.</v>

19
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>We think the film's main failure comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from its inability to juggle two things,</v>

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.333
<v Speaker 1>advancing the main conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 1>steppenwolf and introducing us to our </v>

21
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>new Palette of characters while in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better film.</v>

22
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>These two aspects would work in concert </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other in justice league.</v>

23
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.653
<v Speaker 1>It's the complete opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we have backstory or </v>

24
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:14.734
<v Speaker 1>character development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to come at the expense of the </v>

25
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 1>main story to understand how this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>even possible,</v>

26
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>though we first need to understand one </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental lesson in screenwriting,</v>

27
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>dramatic action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motionless,</v>

28
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>wisecrack condition on the Justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>League.</v>

29
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

30
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>if you can spoil a Turd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers for justice league ahead.</v>

31
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Also Batman v Superman and infinity </v>
<v Speaker 1>ward.</v>

32
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.733
<v Speaker 1>But first a quick recap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice League takes place in a world </v>

33
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:39.484
<v Speaker 1>without superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the man of steel was killed by </v>

34
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Doomsday Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wayne is racked by guilt.</v>

35
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.663
<v Speaker 1>Well supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bruce doesn't have much time to </v>

36
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>dwell on this because a new world ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat is knocking on earth store in the</v>

37
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>form</v>

38
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 2>of the end of worlds can only to</v>

39
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>wants to turn earth into a hellscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to do so,</v>

40
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.723
<v Speaker 1>he'll need to reclaim the mother boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially dcs version of the Infinity </v>

41
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.643
<v Speaker 1>Stones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were reactivated by Superman's </v>

42
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:10.414
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These boxes have been guarded by the </v>

43
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:15.130
<v Speaker 1>ancient tribes of Amazon's Atlanteans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and men for centuries,</v>

44
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.173
<v Speaker 1>but now that steppenwolf is back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that man has to rally the old alliance </v>

45
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:20.014
<v Speaker 1>and build a crack team to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got familiar favorites like Bruce </v>

46
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.913
<v Speaker 1>Wayne and Diana Prince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with a sheldon cooper inspired </v>

47
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>flash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Dothraki Aquaman,</v>

48
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>and a CGI Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is dramatic action?</v>

49
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>While the term applies to all dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

50
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>playwright David Edgar summed it up best</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his book.</v>

51
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 1>How plays work by defining it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>project followed by a contradiction.</v>

52
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that sounds like a Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>nesting doll of terms,</v>

53
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:46.384
<v Speaker 1>so let's break it down by a project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edgar means more or less a goal usually </v>

54
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.170
<v Speaker 1>stated with a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb and object.</v>

55
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.153
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Batman tries to bribe in Icelandic </v>

56
00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:59.490
<v Speaker 1>village into helping him find aqua man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you 20,000</v>

57
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.333
<v Speaker 1>to talk to this man right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get state the project as that man </v>

58
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>looks for Aquaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subject,</v>

59
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>verb object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty simple,</v>

60
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.743
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Batman and Aquaman can't be besties </v>

61
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

62
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no conflict in that rotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes score would slide even further.</v>

63
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's where Edgar's idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction comes in.</v>

64
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Typically our heroes don't get what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want in a scene.</v>

65
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>They run into the contradiction or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply obstacles.</v>

66
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Bruce,</v>

67
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>aqua man doesn't want to play nice with </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

68
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>By comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll need you.</v>

69
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't count on a bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

70
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to keep coming here </v>
<v Speaker 1>digging into my business,</v>

71
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.853
<v Speaker 1>getting into my life to Ed Group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to express the </v>

72
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:39.754
<v Speaker 1>contradiction is a basic statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we were to put the project and </v>

73
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>contradiction together for this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get something like this.</v>

74
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Batman looks for Aquaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Aquaman is a dick.</v>

75
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why dramatic action is such a</v>

76
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.004
<v Speaker 1>big deal is that in advance is conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters make certain choices in the </v>

77
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of their goals only for new </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles to pop up in response to these</v>

78
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the contradiction always gets in</v>

79
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>the way of the project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no scene should end.</v>

80
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:08.734
<v Speaker 1>On the same note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it began just look at Batman who after </v>

81
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>being scorned by aqua man wonders if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost him forever.</v>

82
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.303
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying you have no way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconnecting with this tracking device </v>

83
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:21.084
<v Speaker 1>in his he left without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what screenwriting Guru Robert </v>

84
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.023
<v Speaker 1>Mckee means when he says that a scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>must turn in his book story Mckee </v>

85
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the value charged condition of the </v>

86
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>character's life stays unchanged from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one end of a scene to the other,</v>

87
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.783
<v Speaker 1>nothing meaningful happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scene has activity talking about </v>

88
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

89
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>but nothing changes in value.</v>

90
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.223
<v Speaker 1>It is a non event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that last point that's relevant </v>

91
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>without dramatic action conflict in </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance and the scene won't turn.</v>

92
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And this is where justice league </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously screws up.</v>

93
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.063
<v Speaker 1>While most of the scenes do have </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic action and do turn they do so </v>

94
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.104
<v Speaker 1>by focusing on our heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual arcs at the expense of the </v>

95
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though scenes turn it's done in</v>

96
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>a way that's hasty and ungratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at aquaman again.</v>

97
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Following the mother box being stolen </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Atlantis,</v>

98
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>we see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrug it off.</v>

99
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.153
<v Speaker 1>The project of this scene would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aquaman wants to abandon Atlantis and </v>

100
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense based on the character </v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw earlier,</v>

101
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>a man who's only allegiance is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

102
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>strong man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strong as alone.</v>

103
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.203
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the opposite of what they're </v>

104
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:34.204
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then comes the contradiction and </v>

105
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>tell me if you see a problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mother left you to save your life.</v>

106
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Karen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine how much it costs,</v>

107
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.713
<v Speaker 1>but you're not a defenseless child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it would have been her </v>

108
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:53.790
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to follow that monster to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface and stop him.</v>

109
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

110
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.044
<v Speaker 1>so that character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea who she is and that </v>

112
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.340
<v Speaker 1>backstory yet never hinted at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while sure there is a contradiction,</v>

113
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:09.584
<v Speaker 1>we could express it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some brando convinces aquaman to </v>

114
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels cheap,</v>

115
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>like a purely artificial inconvenient </v>
<v Speaker 1>plot device,</v>

116
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.020
<v Speaker 1>almost as cheap as another poor dce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You turn eight Dsx Martha,</v>

117
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

118
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the only time justice league </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to cheat when it comes to dramatic</v>

119
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>action in our character scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to prove our point.</v>

120
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating moments in the movie,</v>

121
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>the discussion to bring superman back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

122
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>While we could talk about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>project of this scene,</v>

123
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>bruce argues to bring back superman </v>
<v Speaker 1>defies the logic of its predecessor.</v>

124
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.373
<v Speaker 1>He has the power to wipe out the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>human race and if we believe there's </v>

125
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>even a one percent chance that he is our</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>

126
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.583
<v Speaker 1>we have to take it as an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty by concocting some weird pet </v>

127
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>cemetery debate.</v>

128
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>We mean bring them back in like a Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's back way,</v>

129
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>not in like a like a pet cemetery </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>

130
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the contradiction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really gets us while bruce advocates for</v>

131
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:08.984
<v Speaker 1>Superman's revival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he encounters his first obstacle in the </v>

132
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:12.224
<v Speaker 1>form of Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's worried about what happens if the </v>

133
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>plan fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're risking lives.</v>

134
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>There's and maybe comes this more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have time for a control group.</v>

135
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Is it a risk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

136
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's necessarily because of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt.</v>

137
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this had you scratching your head,</v>

138
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you're not alone because nowhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceeding our did the film show a Bruce</v>

139
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Wayne tormented by guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no flashbacks,</v>

140
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>no dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no coping mechanisms,</v>

141
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and if you think we're being unduly </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh,</v>

142
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>then know that all of these were </v>
<v Speaker 1>employed in Batman v Superman to explain</v>

143
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>bruises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme distrust for the man of steel.</v>

144
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Just like with Aquaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene has dramatic action and yes it</v>

145
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:50.024
<v Speaker 1>turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only through artificially inserted </v>

146
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>

147
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:54.824
<v Speaker 1>there are some pretty big consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>for making so much of the dramatic </v>

148
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>action focus on our heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thin,</v>

149
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>personal and interpersonal arcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

150
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:04.304
<v Speaker 1>the film is so preoccupied with rushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set up our characters and their own </v>

151
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 1>foibles like flashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social awkwardness,</v>

152
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>aquaman's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lone cop persona,</v>

153
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>sideboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self hatred,</v>

154
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:14.474
<v Speaker 1>and Diana's isolation from the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's seemingly forget steppenwolf </v>

155
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Case in point.</v>

156
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Consider the mother boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know these</v>

157
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.173
<v Speaker 3>carried from planet to planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mother boxes combined to form the </v>

158
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:31.721
<v Speaker 3>unity and apocalyptic power that not </v>
<v Speaker 3>only destroys world transforms them into</v>

159
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 3>the primordial hellscape of steppenwolf </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit world.</v>

160
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:37.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might surprise you to learn that </v>

161
00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:39.544
<v Speaker 1>Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably the protagonist of the film </v>

162
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>only learns that the box is important at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 30 minute mark,</v>

163
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.543
<v Speaker 1>but surely the rest of the film and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes are focused on keeping the boxes </v>

164
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 1>from steppenwolf's poorly CGI hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

166
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>the first box is stolen from amazons </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any of our heroes present.</v>

167
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>The second one features a measly 32nd </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight scene with Aquaman and just to rub</v>

168
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>it in how little our heroes care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual plot.</v>

169
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.413
<v Speaker 1>The third and final mother box is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically stolen off screen while our </v>

170
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>team is recovering from a superman beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>down another box.</v>

171
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>He has the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what you guys are thinking,</v>

172
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>jared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by assembling the team,</v>

173
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the Justice League is stopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steppenwolf and while there's definitely</v>

174
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:24.024
<v Speaker 1>some merit to that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shouldn't be an either or scenario </v>

175
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>to prove my point.</v>

176
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at another film with a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar premise.</v>

177
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.093
<v Speaker 1>Infinity war in the film fan is hellbent</v>
<v Speaker 1>on destroying half of all life by </v>

178
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:39.770
<v Speaker 1>gathering the infinity stones after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Banner Escape Stenosis,</v>

179
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>grasping the opening scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole enlist the help of Dr.</v>

180
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Strange and Tony Stark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he gets his hands on all $6,</v>

181
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:47.963
<v Speaker 1>Dani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can destroy life on a scale hither </v>

182
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>to on dreamtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>

183
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice three things in the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

184
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.073
<v Speaker 1>our heroes get together and learn of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>initial threat in under 15 minutes to </v>

185
00:09:58.801 --> 00:09:59.634
<v Speaker 1>our heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically strange envision possess </v>

186
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.353
<v Speaker 1>infinity stones that puts them on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash course with the plot and most </v>

187
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:07.974
<v Speaker 1>importantly three our heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personal problems are intermixed with </v>

188
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the conversation to stop Banjos who just</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaved your match glass me seriously.</v>

189
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Don't know how you fit your head into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

190
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>how admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should've ducked out when I told you</v>

191
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>to if it wasn't already obvious.</v>

192
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Stark and strange aren't exactly fond of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

193
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:25.644
<v Speaker 1>and the dramatic action of any given </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene is as much about stopping fan ost </v>

194
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>as it is about learning to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

195
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but as the to continue to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>alongside each other.</v>

196
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Their dysfunction goes from Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reluctantly rescuing strange.</v>

197
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really my friend.</v>

198
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.243
<v Speaker 1>Saving his life is more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional courtesy to strange </v>

199
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 1>bartering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time stone away to save Tony's life,</v>

200
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>spare his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will give you the stone.</v>

201
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.893
<v Speaker 1>In this last instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dramatic action of the scene is </v>

202
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.474
<v Speaker 1>equally about plot stopping banjos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>character Tony and strangers </v>

203
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.334
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The project is and wants to kill Tony </v>

204
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.843
<v Speaker 1>and the contradiction is but strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>stops him by giving away the time stone </v>

205
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this moment resonated.</v>

206
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Now we'd be wrong to say that this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of interplay between our heroes,</v>

207
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 1>personal conflict and the actual plot is</v>
<v Speaker 1>absent in justice league,</v>

208
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but we'd also be wrong to say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar in terms of quality or scale.</v>

209
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.283
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the flash for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the film makes a point of showing </v>

210
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 1>his desperate need for friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need friends.</v>

211
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>This conflict doesn't really manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself anywhere else in the film,</v>

212
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>let alone in a confrontation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>steppenwolf.</v>

213
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.120
<v Speaker 1>The closest we have to it is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>

214
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.890
<v Speaker 1>You guys see ready to do battle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

215
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 1>but in full transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done battle.</v>

216
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.583
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dramatic action to the sequence </v>

217
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:45.474
<v Speaker 1>could be stated as clashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared to enter the frig and </v>

218
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Steppenwolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Batman convinces him,</v>

219
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.933
<v Speaker 1>but we have to ask at what part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie did indicate to us that he had </v>

220
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>combat stagefright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

221
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:57.544
<v Speaker 1>this scene feels like a tenuous tie in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Barry's personal struggles and </v>

222
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 1>stopping the world ending threat and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film treats it as such.</v>

223
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 1>After the flash rescue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hostages,</v>

224
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:09.570
<v Speaker 1>the film conveniently forgets any of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage fright.</v>

225
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

226
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>these scenes often fail to evoke the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmark of good writing,</v>

227
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.743
<v Speaker 1>aristotle's idea of catharsis or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purification or projection of emotions </v>

228
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>primarily through art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Justice League fails to properly</v>

229
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 1>tether our character's personal journeys</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the action of the plot.</v>

230
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>We don't feel the proper emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety,</v>

231
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>fear relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have none of it washes over us.</v>

232
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see Diana and Cyborg.</v>

233
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.253
<v Speaker 1>Finally coming out of hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hear aqua man talk about friendship </v>

234
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 1>or regrets or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die.</v>

235
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to do.</v>

236
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.413
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like we're really embraced </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiordland I've been my whole life </v>

237
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 1>because these aren't developed and tied </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the action of the plot.</v>

238
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.363
<v Speaker 1>There's no catharsis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We as the audience just can't muster up </v>

239
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>the energy to care and we really can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize this enough.</v>

240
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what infinity war excels</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

241
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Consider the relationship between Tony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stark and Peter Parker,</v>

242
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>which is developed hand in hand with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main plot.</v>

243
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.923
<v Speaker 1>More often than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our duo find some subs bickering like </v>

244
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 1>father and son in the face of enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

245
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Tony Wants Peter Safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're going to say.</v>

246
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>You should not be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to go home.</v>

247
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.633
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hit it with such a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>way down and I just thought about </v>

248
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.753
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to hear this side of the ship </v>

249
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and this shoot is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intuitive,</v>

250
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if anything,</v>

251
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of your fault that I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you do?</v>

252
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Say I take that back and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship affects the action.</v>

253
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Like when Tony plays hardball for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter's life,</v>

254
00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>when they're both mistaken for Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his henchmen.</v>

255
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Tell me where the girl is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I swear to you,</v>

256
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to French fry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little freak steward.</v>

257
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Just shoot my gun on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blessed him.</v>

258
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly because we see Tony and</v>

259
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Peter's dynamic grow and change over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of the film.</v>

260
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.353
<v Speaker 1>We're invested in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes moments like this </v>

261
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>legitimately Cathartic</v>

262
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 1>in contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the resolution scenes of the Justice</v>

263
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>League characters feel obligatory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>phoned in.</v>

264
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.953
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference between feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine emotion in the theater and </v>

265
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>leaving saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

266
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess that was a movie in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice League stands as a case study of</v>

267
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 1>a film that feels to balance two very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important things,</v>

268
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.363
<v Speaker 1>character and plot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose makes sense when you </v>

269
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>consider how they had to establish all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these new franchises for movies to come,</v>

270
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but what do you guys think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is dramatic action,</v>

271
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:37.774
<v Speaker 1>the best lens to focus this problem or </v>
<v Speaker 1>are there bigger issues lurking in the </v>

272
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 1>justice league?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you think and hey,</v>
