00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Worldview?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.114
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great believer in him and liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.363
<v Speaker 1>the genius of the American experiment is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a respect for the dignity of the </v>

6
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm opposed to a trade </v>

8
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm opposed to most immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings are human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

11
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:39.244
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they had deserve the dignity </v>

12
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom.</v>

13
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's a worldwide phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must say that in the 30 years the Cato</v>

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Institute is existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying we deserve credit for</v>

15
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:51.664
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.583
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extension of human freedom has been </v>

17
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of people are freer</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>more prosperous today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>because of the recognition that markets </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expansion of trade,</v>

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition of the importance of private</v>

24
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>those are great things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

26
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I view them as universal.</v>

27
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.024
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cato Institute is actively involved </v>

28
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>in promoting these ideas in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia and Latin America,</v>

30
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

31
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we held the first conferences devoted</v>

32
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 1>to freedom in the history of communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

33
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>And in the history of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>we went to China in 1988 and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>we brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Milton was treated like a rockstar.</v>

37
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very exciting.</v>

38
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>two years later we were in Moscow and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>and had the first conference they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted to,</v>

41
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>to political and economic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

42
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm very proud of the cato institutes</v>

43
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 1>orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not simply parochial.</v>

44
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:16.114
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are around the world trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote the concept of the dignity of </v>

45
00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:21.274
<v Speaker 1>the individual.</v>

46
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

48
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:31.051
<v Speaker 1>the basic kind of classical Roth Bharti </v>
<v Speaker 1>and approach to libertarianism is,</v>

49
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

51
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have,</v>

52
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and this is a randy and I Iran's </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to the initiation of force.</v>

53
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:41.594
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong that people should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever they want to do as long as </v>

54
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>they're not harming other people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so,</v>

55
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:53.321
<v Speaker 1>whether through fraud or physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence or a theft or,</v>

56
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

57
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you want the maximum amount of </v>

58
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>individual liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

59
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not all clear cut in theory from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely rights standpoint.</v>

61
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>What Michael Vick did with these dogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

62
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.100
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>offend anyone's personal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think as a libertarian,</v>

65
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

66
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:25.294
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting in trouble with my </v>

67
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I th I think that,</v>

68
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a free society that you should be </v>

70
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:34.984
<v Speaker 1>you can't torture animals and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a crime and it doesn't fit </v>

72
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>in neatly with a libertarian theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

73
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way it should be.</v>

74
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love dogs so,</v>

75
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the proper role of the,</v>

76
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.550
<v Speaker 1>the government is the protection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

77
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:56.384
<v Speaker 1>liberty and the pursuit of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the declaration of </v>

78
00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Independence said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

80
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical concept that government should </v>

81
00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:07.190
<v Speaker 1>be limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>to protecting your right to live your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life as,</v>

83
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.520
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.254
<v Speaker 1>the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of happiness is uniquely </v>

87
00:04:17.151 --> 00:04:18.110
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:23.111
<v Speaker 1>it is saying that life is a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you should be able to enjoy it.</v>

89
00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And happiness is not saying you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a party every night.</v>

90
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It's saying you should be able to pursue</v>
<v Speaker 1>your values and your goals in life.</v>

91
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reasonable goal for </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

93
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

94
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.391
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean air and water,</v>

97
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:46.400
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be able to pollute what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

98
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>the average citizen has to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

99
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 1>those are legitimate functions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
