2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>More on movement at the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared here.</v>

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.193
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about the story of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who takes down the finance industry </v>

5
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>as he's hawks to imaginary friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.013
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot.</v>

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.123
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot follows hoody clad hacker Elliot </v>

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.943
<v Speaker 1>Alderson as he and his buddies </v>
<v Speaker 1>instigated a revolution and take down </v>

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.793
<v Speaker 1>equal a fictional mega corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the gold standard of corporate </v>

10
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conglomeration of Bank of America,</v>

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Walmart and Enron also Elliot's crazy on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface.</v>

12
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot is a show criticizing capitalism.</v>

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Tell him about the type of money makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you question right and wrong,</v>

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>but to really understand Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>

15
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.534
<v Speaker 1>we have to dig deeper into an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is woven into the very fabric of the </v>

16
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alienation.</v>

17
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Alienation means to be estranged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated.</v>

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>In the parlance of Mr.</v>

19
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Robot disconnected philosophy deals with</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of alienation.</v>

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>There's alienation from humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the world,</v>

21
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and even personal alienation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've become a stranger to yourself.</v>

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot explores them all.</v>

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Welcome with his wives cry condition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of Mr.</v>

24
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and spoiler alert.</v>

25
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.773
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot is about lonely people trying to </v>

26
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:18.354
<v Speaker 1>connect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that means quite literally </v>

27
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>connecting illegally to other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>

28
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.753
<v Speaker 1>Agent Dipiro has no life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no life and struggles to connect with </v>

29
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>both strange men on the internet and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon Alexa.</v>

30
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Elliot struggles to connect with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>his past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his friends,</v>

32
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:36.234
<v Speaker 1>and even reality and the masses </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Elliot can only connect to </v>

33
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>each other through facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram,</v>

34
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>and linkedin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show,</v>

35
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.314
<v Speaker 1>even employees visual tricks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize the distance between </v>

36
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.554
<v Speaker 1>characters such as wide angle lenses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>framing characters near the edge of the </v>

37
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.514
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot's and ability to connect is </v>

38
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:52.944
<v Speaker 1>caused by more than just his social </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety or that he talks to his dead </v>

39
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

40
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot's alienation has everything to do</v>

41
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>

42
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Elliot is unable to understand his </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>

43
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:05.844
<v Speaker 1>his motives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even his relationship to other </v>

44
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:08.094
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Robot takes charge of Elliot's </v>

45
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:10.494
<v Speaker 1>physical body interacting with people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his behalf all while Elliot is </v>

46
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>completely unaware that anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transpired.</v>

47
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot isn't able to understand his </v>

48
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darlene,</v>

49
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>or anyone else he might've interacted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

50
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:22.704
<v Speaker 1>As Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot and while Elliot Psychosis makes </v>

51
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>his alienation from himself and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique,</v>

52
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.413
<v Speaker 1>the logic that dictates that psychosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>is nearly universal for German </v>

53
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludvig Feuerbach,</v>

54
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>whose name means fire stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I digress.</v>

55
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>God was the primary engine of alienation</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 19th century.</v>

56
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.083
<v Speaker 1>Humans created the figure of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the lawyer Bach and </v>

57
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>instilled in with their highest ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

58
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>

59
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being a forgetful species,</v>

60
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>they forgot.</v>

61
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at this virtuous God and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

62
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>we're so much like this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made us just like him in this way.</v>

63
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.514
<v Speaker 1>The fact that man made God in man's </v>
<v Speaker 1>image is inverted to God created man in </v>

64
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>God's image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

65
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is alienating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We become estranged from our ideals,</v>

66
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.154
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and each other because we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>only relate to them through the medium </v>

67
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>of God of figure that we've since lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of,</v>

68
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>if this seems strangely familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should.</v>

69
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.233
<v Speaker 1>Elliot creates the figure of Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot forgets he created him and then </v>

70
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>goes about letting Mr robot run his life</v>
<v Speaker 1>in good feuerbach,</v>

71
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Ian and fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot says,</v>

72
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot has become my God and even creates</v>

73
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.204
<v Speaker 1>Mr robot in his own crazy image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Robot is even liken to an omniscient </v>

74
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 1>God always watching Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>

75
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>you have a presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot's first response to the problem,</v>

76
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

77
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.193
<v Speaker 1>Robot is to get rid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pumps himself full of adderall and </v>

78
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>starts journaling in the hopes that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can kill him off.</v>

79
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>This in a way parallels the atheist </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to God,</v>

80
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>but I don't listen to my imaginary </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

81
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Why should I listen to yours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invented God.</v>

82
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Now we realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's dump Joe,</v>

83
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>but Elliot's therapist convinces him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the answer isn't to dump Mr.</v>

84
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.874
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to accept his delusion as part of </v>

85
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

86
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.803
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to accept the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the legitimate and existence and </v>

87
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.404
<v Speaker 1>your life for 40 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest problem isn't that we </v>

88
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.154
<v Speaker 1>invented God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that we inverted our relationship </v>

89
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>to God and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he created us.</v>

90
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm only supposed to be a prophet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be my God or voc </v>

91
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>thinks that God is the ultimate object </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking man,</v>

92
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>a creation that speaks to the unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential of our reason.</v>

93
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.893
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Robot represents Elliot's highest </v>

94
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.714
<v Speaker 1>ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a better future without Evil </v>

95
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Corp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big issues with alienation is</v>

96
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the loss of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the old,</v>

97
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God does.</v>

98
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.503
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot either suppresses the memory of </v>

99
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>the unpleasant acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to commit in the name of a better</v>

100
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.280
<v Speaker 1>future like allegedly killing a guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagines.</v>

101
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot is responsible in the process.</v>

102
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Elliot isn't able to directly relate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

103
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He helps shape or his peers and instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to relate to the medium of Mr.</v>

104
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It's only when Elliot admits that Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot is his own creation.</v>

106
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Betty can finally carve a path out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own alienation.</v>

107
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>When we've mixed up the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between God and the world around us,</v>

108
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>the world becomes confusing cause and </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects seem to invert themselves.</v>

109
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Galilee slips away and we lose touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our fellow man.</v>

110
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>No longer are we the drivers of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

111
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but events are laid out by the divine or</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imaginary friend.</v>

112
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer the judge of our actions</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the actions of others.</v>

113
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>God is the rest of the world doesn't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

114
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:43.144
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't stop the show from </v>

115
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>drawing an explicit connection between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliott's delusions and there.</v>

116
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>So don't tell me about not being real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Mr.</v>

117
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.354
<v Speaker 1>Robot may be Elliot Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the masses have a different God </v>

118
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to eight different kinds</v>

119
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>of alienation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show Creator Sam.</v>

120
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Ismael holds nothing back in paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>homage to other films,</v>

121
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:06.974
<v Speaker 1>critical of consumer culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from the obvious fight club and V </v>

122
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>for vendetta references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One scene evokes John Carpenter's,</v>

123
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>they live of film exploring the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind modern capitalism and Tyrrell.</v>

124
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Welock is one big O,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two American psycho of film where people</v>

125
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>become as disposable as commodity </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorbet.</v>

126
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.223
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the central tenants of Mr Robot </v>

127
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>is that consumer culture is a collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion.</v>

128
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>One that is strange is us from the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and each other.</v>

129
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.473
<v Speaker 1>When Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot reminds Elliot that nothing is </v>

130
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

131
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.690
<v Speaker 2>oh whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Builds on fence.</v>

132
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.613
<v Speaker 2>Synthetic emotions in the form of pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological warfare in the form of </v>

133
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.323
<v Speaker 2>advertising.</v>

134
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Season one elliot decides to be normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>by hearting things on instagram,</v>

135
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:49.950
<v Speaker 1>watching marvel movies and drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>

136
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.453
<v Speaker 1>drinking starbucks throughout the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Material Items and wealth is strange </v>

137
00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:55.434
<v Speaker 1>people from their true selves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever Angela Moss has confronted </v>

138
00:06:58.081 --> 00:07:00.270
<v Speaker 1>about her working for Evil Corp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

139
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.000
<v Speaker 1>she defends her character with displays </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth.</v>

140
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.983
<v Speaker 1>When she goes to buy a new pair of shoes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace a pair covered in her </v>

141
00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:09.960
<v Speaker 1>coworkers brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salesman confronts her saying,</v>

142
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.360
<v Speaker 3>tell me witness this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're here to buy new shoes.</v>

143
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to,</v>

144
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 1>but I'll try the products next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When again,</v>

145
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:25.050
<v Speaker 1>confronted at a bar by her father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

146
00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>She responds</v>

147
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 2>in 2007 and I've got a six figure salary</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the biggest thing on right in history</v>

148
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just getting started.</v>

149
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>If Angeles motive seem unclear to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer,</v>

150
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.913
<v Speaker 1>they're probably also unclear to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a strange world is a disorienting </v>

151
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela,</v>

152
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:44.164
<v Speaker 1>who stresses she needs the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evil Corp officer is in the same light </v>

153
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>as the guy who has to euthanize dogs for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a living.</v>

154
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.623
<v Speaker 1>It's just sick that in on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to pay the bills or the homeless </v>

155
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:53.914
<v Speaker 1>guy who allows Tarell to beat him </v>
<v Speaker 1>senseless while wearing sterilized </v>

156
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.184
<v Speaker 1>surgical gloves in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leon can only relate to elliot with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>DVD Collection,</v>

158
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.360
<v Speaker 1>namely Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show about nothing.</v>

159
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.410
<v Speaker 1>The human condition is a straight of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy because in all of these cases,</v>

160
00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:11.440
<v Speaker 1>mass culture and commodities inhibit our</v>
<v Speaker 1>very being.</v>

161
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Advertising and media encourage us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy a part of ourselves to fit in.</v>

162
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 3>You destroy parts of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>

163
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 3>We Photoshop our wards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii annihilation is all we are.</v>

164
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It sells us pre packaged narratives </v>
<v Speaker 1>about love and life for Elliot.</v>

165
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Only when we destroy the alienating </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of consumerism,</v>

166
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.140
<v Speaker 1>can we finally be free?</v>

167
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:37.410
<v Speaker 3>We will find our true selves again maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>after wiping away the thick,</v>

168
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.583
<v Speaker 3>grimy film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a facebook friend requests and vine </v>

169
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>

170
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:42.091
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

171
00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Robot shows a another kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienation.</v>

172
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Commodity fetishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodity fetishism works a lot like for</v>

173
00:08:48.031 --> 00:08:50.760
<v Speaker 1>your box alienation and it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's greater.</v>

174
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx appropriated for your box work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his own ends,</v>

175
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>for marks of God mediating human </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations commodities.</v>

176
00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:58.944
<v Speaker 1>Do we imbue commodities with abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>value in such a way that everything </v>

177
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>becomes commodified for Tyrell Welock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every interaction is an exchange.</v>

178
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Even going so far is he uses own body in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of greater wealth.</v>

179
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the Washington township </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial,</v>

180
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.004
<v Speaker 1>the people who died as a result of evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpse actions or treated as mere </v>

181
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>commodities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profits are more important than people's</v>

182
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:20.784
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for the same reason that evil </v>

183
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>corporate executives can so easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive colby after he testified against</v>

184
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:27.324
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every action isn't some indicator of </v>

185
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an exchange of goods and services.</v>

186
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.663
<v Speaker 1>In the same vein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philip Price Hires Angela despite the </v>

187
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:35.814
<v Speaker 1>fact that she blackmailed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what exactly are the stakes of </v>

188
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 1>alienation in the world of Mr?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot.</v>

189
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>It's control for both Feuerbach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marx,</v>

190
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the world of the object of collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>human labor,</v>

191
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.343
<v Speaker 1>the Labor that affirms our species being</v>
<v Speaker 1>or our membership to the human race </v>

192
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.073
<v Speaker 1>alienation destroys that species being </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world that we collectively </v>

193
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 1>build together as now been hijacked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone or something else,</v>

194
00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.843
<v Speaker 1>it's no surprise then that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>character from Angela to elliot to </v>

195
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Tyrrell to price and ministers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zhong are vying for control.</v>

196
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.573
<v Speaker 1>You've brought up this issue</v>

197
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.433
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

198
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>this issue of not feeling like you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

199
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.553
<v Speaker 1>The series even opens with a monologue </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the people who have the real </v>

200
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>control in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secret board meetings,</v>

201
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>control who lives and dies over shrimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocktails.</v>

202
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.073
<v Speaker 1>So you were drunk eating shrimp cocktail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was raining when you decided my </v>

203
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 1>mother would die and young people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>racked with debt,</v>

204
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.463
<v Speaker 1>forcing them into jobs they hate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot can't stop the voice in his head </v>

205
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:35.604
<v Speaker 1>from taking over his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ministers Zhang is obsessed with time </v>

206
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:39.354
<v Speaker 1>surrounding himself with clocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only to remind them of the one thing </v>

207
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>he can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

208
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Just put a walking shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No poor player that struts and Brett's,</v>

209
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.000
<v Speaker 1>he's on his stage and Ben is hurting.</v>

210
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You surrounded yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant reminder of mortality.</v>

211
00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Led,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen,</v>

212
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.413
<v Speaker 1>constantly scribbling in his notebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>about control or fighting for control </v>

213
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 1>with Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>

214
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>he attributes Shayla is abused by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fernando Vera to the invisible hand,</v>

215
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the economic forces that control her </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

216
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 1>There it is again the invisible hand at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work controlling us even if it pushes us</v>

217
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.330
<v Speaker 1>past our threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his therapist's office,</v>

218
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.253
<v Speaker 1>he likens the freedom afforded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary society to the choice </v>

219
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>between Pepsi and coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real question is,</v>

220
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.643
<v Speaker 1>where's the RC Cola?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both tyrrell and Elliot blame their </v>

221
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>fathers for their lack of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early on,</v>

222
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Elliot blames his father for giving up </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Evil Corp poisoned him.</v>

223
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.793
<v Speaker 4>It's about how those bastard slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed your father and how he wished </v>

224
00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:40.930
<v Speaker 4>he'd done something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't because he was his hero.</v>

225
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Just like you're being right now.</v>

226
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.053
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raul never wants to become his father </v>

227
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.950
<v Speaker 1>who's inability to speak English was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminder of his helplessness.</v>

228
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Father used to say that to me all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time as a child,</v>

229
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.323
<v Speaker 1>what was the only English she knew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The journals that Elliot frantically </v>

230
00:11:56.501 --> 00:12:01.270
<v Speaker 1>whites about controlling is aptly named </v>
<v Speaker 1>red wheelbarrow tyrrells own reminder of</v>

231
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>his father's impotence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm silly.</v>

232
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Po Tyrell also likens murdering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon knows to absolute power.</v>

233
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>He and others are really into playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God tend to leave a legacy.</v>

234
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.210
<v Speaker 1>The standard of which was set by God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliot at times is unsure if he's Mr.</v>

235
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Robot Scott or Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot is his God.</v>

236
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.913
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr robot shows that nobody is really in </v>

237
00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:25.764
<v Speaker 1>control in an alienated world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people at the top have become </v>

238
00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:31.830
<v Speaker 1>victims of their own machinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they may try to create an illusion</v>

239
00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:32.664
<v Speaker 1>of control with armies of lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convoluted conspiracies and bunker data </v>

240
00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:38.280
<v Speaker 1>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all experienced the same alienating</v>

241
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:39.114
<v Speaker 1>forces as the rest of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be in the form of God or </v>

242
00:12:41.971 --> 00:12:43.890
<v Speaker 1>commodity fetishism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conclusion.</v>

243
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.143
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot is not only a show about lonely </v>

244
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:47.394
<v Speaker 1>people trying to connect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about the engines that drive that </v>

245
00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 1>loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's God or imaginary friends or</v>

246
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:56.790
<v Speaker 1>the things we own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That engine distorts our perceptions and</v>

247
00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:57.624
<v Speaker 1>turns a reality on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can never really be sure what's </v>

248
00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:01.620
<v Speaker 1>reality or delusion and Mr.</v>

249
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Robot and that's sort of the in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienated world.</v>

250
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Can we be sure that any kind of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists?</v>
