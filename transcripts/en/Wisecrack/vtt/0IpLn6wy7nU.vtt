1
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's changed enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm in television was already the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant factor when I came in,</v>

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1960,</v>

4
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:22.991
<v Speaker 1>but there was a real sort of balance </v>
<v Speaker 1>between print and television at that,</v>

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under campaign buses,</v>

6
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.903
<v Speaker 1>the print reporters still sat up front </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the television people sat in the </v>

7
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>back of the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed pretty quickly.</v>

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And now of course with cable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>networks and the print our in the back </v>

11
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 1>seat and cable is driving the bus.</v>

12
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem that is a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifact of the,</v>

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.943
<v Speaker 1>I think mostly the television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role as the dominant channel of </v>

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>communication for politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the politicians learned was that if</v>

15
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>they maintain the old fashioned way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigning,</v>

16
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>a set speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex tax on foreign policy or foreign</v>

17
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:21.761
<v Speaker 1>policy or economic policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reporters had wide range as to what</v>

18
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>they chose to report from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches.</v>

19
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>But if they framed their message each </v>
<v Speaker 1>day in a single sound byte,</v>

20
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>particularly if they could do it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a dramatic setting,</v>

21
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>a closed steel mill or a polluted </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream,</v>

22
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>that became the message for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>television coverage.</v>

23
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.783
<v Speaker 1>And so with television you went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had essentially was a shrinkage of </v>

24
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the daily message from the campaigns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sound byte level.</v>
