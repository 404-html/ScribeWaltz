00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an article in last month's art </v>

2
00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.494
<v Speaker 1>news about museums in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's hundreds of them coming all </v>

3
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.124
<v Speaker 1>over China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not run the same way that </v>

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.693
<v Speaker 1>Western museums are run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference is that the people </v>

5
00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:26.611
<v Speaker 1>running western museums are coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a long history of kind of established</v>

6
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>profession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're kind of,</v>

7
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standards are different,</v>

8
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>so maybe the way they choose exhibitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>

9
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.914
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the way they approach the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there should be climate control is </v>

10
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:39.334
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the way that somebody gets into </v>

11
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the position of director is different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe it's more political.</v>

12
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's more government control of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the exhibitions.</v>
