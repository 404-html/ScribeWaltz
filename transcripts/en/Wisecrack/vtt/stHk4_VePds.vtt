00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>This video is brought to you by audible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>was helen here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jared is on vacation,</v>

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>which gives me the chance to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about the philosophy of a show about</v>

4
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could get meta.</v>

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.913
<v Speaker 1>The good place is a fascinating piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>television because while it includes </v>

6
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>philosophy lessons as a major plot </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it also incorporates its own ideas on </v>
<v Speaker 1>human nature,</v>

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.123
<v Speaker 1>fate and ethics for a show us sensibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>about teaching people to be good in the </v>

9
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.354
<v Speaker 1>afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good place asks a more profound </v>

10
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:36.054
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can those lessons actually make us </v>

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>better people and if they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that matter?</v>

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.143
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to today's much requested </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode on the philosophy of the good </v>

13
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spoilers ahead.</v>

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a recap for any uninitiated into the </v>

15
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:51.504
<v Speaker 1>world of the good place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The premise of the first season is that </v>

16
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>coworker betraying senior scamming </v>
<v Speaker 1>tequila slugging human garbage.</v>

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor Shell Strop dies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally ends up in the good place.</v>

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>There's been a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not supposed to be here,</v>

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>which is basically heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except without all the religion he stuff</v>

20
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>which we're laying makes it way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more elitist.</v>

21
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.703
<v Speaker 1>Only the very best to get into the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>place based on an intense point system </v>

22
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:17.604
<v Speaker 1>to determine exactly how good you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need me to lie to old people and </v>

23
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>scare them into buying fake allergy </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>

24
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:23.484
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

25
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.413
<v Speaker 1>Which one's my desk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though eleanor probably doesn't </v>

26
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>belong in any religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good place.</v>

27
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>The point system gets absurd.</v>

28
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.263
<v Speaker 2>Every single thing you did had an effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rippled out over time and </v>

29
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>ultimately created some amount of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>or bad.</v>

30
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 1>She's joined in her paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood by to honey,</v>

31
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy philanthropist.</v>

32
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.583
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a Buddhist monk and her supposedly </v>

33
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>soulmate Cheaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a philosophy professor specializing in,</v>

34
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you guessed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics also.</v>

35
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of frozen yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it with you and frozen yogurt?</v>

36
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Have you not heard of ice?</v>

37
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.243
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I've come to really like frozen </v>

38
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.374
<v Speaker 2>yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something so human about taking </v>

39
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 2>something great and ruining it a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can have more of it.</v>

40
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.073
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are good place is supposed to be </v>

41
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:09.934
<v Speaker 1>heaven for eleanor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being surrounded by people who are </v>

42
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>better than her is actual hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After eleanor tells Cidi her secret that</v>

43
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:18.064
<v Speaker 1>she's there by mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decides to teach her to be a good </v>

44
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>person by conjuring up a chalkboard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving her daily philosophy lessons.</v>

45
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.443
<v Speaker 1>This leads to some of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy jokes on television who died </v>

46
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>and left aristotle in charge of ethics </v>
<v Speaker 1>play doll.</v>

47
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and John,</v>

48
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you is actually Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trashy Florida,</v>

49
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 1>want to be dj who is also there by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

50
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>So he joins in on the ethics classes </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

51
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>This is your first step towards not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking.</v>

52
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have two questions.</v>

53
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 2>One or football tryouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and does the school have a prom?</v>

54
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

55
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.663
<v Speaker 1>For most of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eleanor's moral progress runs parallel </v>

56
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>to her ethics lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more she internalizes philosophy,</v>

57
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>the more see her making decisions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are halfway decent,</v>

58
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.763
<v Speaker 1>if not downright suite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show at face value sets up the </v>

59
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>premise that learning ethics makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>act more ethically.</v>

60
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.263
<v Speaker 1>At least that's the premise the cheeky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eleanor are working from as he goes </v>

61
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>through the grueling task of teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>contractual ism to someone who abandoned</v>

62
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>dog sitting duties to go to a rihanna </v>
<v Speaker 1>concert.</v>

63
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.520
<v Speaker 1>You broke your promise as soon as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't convenient for you,</v>

64
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>and now I have a very full office dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That idea that learning moral philosophy</v>

65
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>can make you a better person is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical theory in itself.</v>

66
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>The question of whether or not ethics </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make you a better person and if so,</v>

67
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>what ethical system best accomplishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is called Meta ethics.</v>

68
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.353
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good place is a show about Metta </v>

69
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:45.934
<v Speaker 1>ethics even as it presents relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight forward ethical theories </v>

70
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>through cheeky and when cheeky teaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ethics,</v>

71
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.820
<v Speaker 1>he goes hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.270
<v Speaker 1>now that you've become acquainted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential crises,</v>

73
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought we could read death by </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Todd May.</v>

74
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like the perfect beach read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor gets the rundown on rawls lock </v>

75
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.800
<v Speaker 1>clout to Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sidgwick Mill,</v>

76
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 1>hume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scanlan,</v>

77
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and quite a few other moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>

78
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.933
<v Speaker 1>including todd may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who just happens to be one of the </v>

79
00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>philosophy consultants for the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice one time.</v>

80
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.093
<v Speaker 1>All of these competing philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts are meant to teach eleanor and </v>

81
00:04:18.681 --> 00:04:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Jason how to be moral enough to remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the good place,</v>

82
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.380
<v Speaker 1>but as any ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one o one student could tell you,</v>

83
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.333
<v Speaker 1>learning a bunch of contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories on what makes someone act good </v>

84
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>does not actually help answer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

85
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>how the fork should I act?</v>

86
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor frequently expresses her </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration with this,</v>

87
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but she keeps on selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the perfect test.</v>

88
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.303
<v Speaker 1>There's something fun that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and then there's something less fun </v>

89
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:43.064
<v Speaker 1>that people are doing for the common </v>
<v Speaker 1>good from the beginning of the ethics </v>

90
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:46.304
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These frustrations hint that the real </v>

91
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:48.674
<v Speaker 1>question isn't which of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers should I base my moral </v>

92
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:51.554
<v Speaker 1>system on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather is this the right way to </v>

93
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.880
<v Speaker 1>learn how to be ethical in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

94
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.923
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gds inability to decide anything driven </v>

95
00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 1>by his thorough knowledge of philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is his main flaw.</v>

96
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I miss my mom's back surgery because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had already promised my landlords nephew</v>

97
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:09.530
<v Speaker 1>that I would help him figure out his new</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

98
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the Cidi who once had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic attack during rock paper,</v>

99
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>scissors because there were just too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many variables.</v>

100
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 1>The show progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor becomes a decent person,</v>

101
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.203
<v Speaker 1>CIDI gets slightly better at making </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions and Jason Gets married to a </v>

102
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 1>robot.</v>

103
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough out of you.</v>

104
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Robot lover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's risk not a robot.</v>

105
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>We're still not sure if that last one </v>
<v Speaker 1>has any secret moral significance.</v>

106
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.420
<v Speaker 1>While you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

107
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.283
<v Speaker 1>gds classes are helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be argued that eleanor and </v>

108
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:39.300
<v Speaker 1>friends are progressing in spite of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy class.</v>

109
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.890
<v Speaker 1>That's because there's a big difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between learning ethics and doing ethics</v>

110
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>and here's where we get back to Meta </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics.</v>

111
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Those questions about what morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is and how we ought to approach</v>

112
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.054
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actual data to support the idea </v>

113
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:58.101
<v Speaker 1>that studying moral philosophy doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily make you more contemporary.</v>

114
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.114
<v Speaker 1>Philosopher Eric Schwitzer level </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted a study between 2007 and 2009 </v>

115
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>there resulted in a maybe not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising conclusion.</v>

116
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.913
<v Speaker 1>Ethics professors do non generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform more ethically then they're not </v>

117
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>at the cyst and non philosopher peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

118
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.723
<v Speaker 1>many of those peers belief that ethics </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors actually performed less </v>

119
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.504
<v Speaker 1>ethically than their counterparts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is consistent with the story of </v>

120
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:25.001
<v Speaker 1>cheating who despite knowing a buttload </v>
<v Speaker 1>about ethical theory ended up in the bad</v>

121
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>place because of the people he </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwittingly hurt through his struggle to</v>

122
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.294
<v Speaker 1>apply those theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why everyone hates moral </v>

123
00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>philosophy professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

124
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>did we mention the good places?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the bad place.</v>

125
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.763
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that.</v>

126
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.693
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] also studied the effects of </v>

127
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:46.744
<v Speaker 1>university level ethics classes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>student behavior and concluded that </v>

128
00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:50.644
<v Speaker 1>there is little to no correlation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between taking ethics classes and moral </v>

129
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:55.660
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

130
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>not a shocker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We often see eleanor struggling to weigh</v>

131
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>competing theories when deciding how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

132
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Irl comp says that lying is always wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I follow that Max,</v>

133
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:08.020
<v Speaker 1>so you can't even lie to demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to torture us,</v>

134
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:08.854
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're behind enemy lines that suppose </v>

135
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>out principles when you pick and choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going to follow them,</v>

136
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 1>and she's actually trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can't exactly be set.</v>

137
00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:16.774
<v Speaker 1>A freshman and a fixed glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Schwitzer Bible study even showed </v>

138
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.964
<v Speaker 1>that ethics books go missing from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>library more often than other kinds of </v>

139
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:25.120
<v Speaker 1>philosophy books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Draw your own conclusions on that one.</v>

140
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.303
<v Speaker 1>I might not have been a saint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like a killed anybody </v>

141
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 1>wasn't an arsonist and never found a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wallet outside of an,</v>

142
00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thought about returning it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but saw the owner lived out of state,</v>

143
00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:37.170
<v Speaker 1>so just took the cash and drop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wallet back on the ground.</v>

144
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really specific and that makes me</v>

145
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:40.890
<v Speaker 3>think that you definitely did do that.</v>

146
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.763
<v Speaker 1>Much of the shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy comes from the absurdity of what </v>

147
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Speaker 1>moral theory looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One played out in reality,</v>

148
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.070
<v Speaker 1>whether that's the panic of indecision </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the hilarity and Gore of the infamous</v>

149
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:53.590
<v Speaker 1>trolley problem happening with a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>trolley.</v>

150
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Here are the lovers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the switch,</v>

151
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 4>the tracks that the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>

152
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:02.711
<v Speaker 4>I mean ethically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean on the one hand you're telling,</v>

153
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.573
<v Speaker 4>telling you</v>

154
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.893
<v Speaker 1>see some of the clearest moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement when the characters stop </v>

155
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>weighing choices based on theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply follow their gut,</v>

156
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 3>which one of these confusing French </v>
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>

157
00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:17.310
<v Speaker 3>we'll make it normal again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that easy.</v>

158
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.263
<v Speaker 3>I mean emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's all over the map right now and I </v>

159
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:21.204
<v Speaker 3>can't believe I'm saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think this can be solved </v>

160
00:08:22.921 --> 00:08:23.754
<v Speaker 3>with a book.</v>

161
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.653
<v Speaker 1>This suggests that while the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>eleanor is trying to be a better person </v>

162
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:29.970
<v Speaker 1>is certainly helping her make better </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

163
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not the theories themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the do the work.</v>

164
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a little more subconscious than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

165
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.233
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor's progress might be explained by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Meta ethical concept called moral </v>

166
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.610
<v Speaker 1>intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ism moral intuition.</v>

167
00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Ism aren't used that it's our intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of what's right and wrong,</v>

168
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.163
<v Speaker 1>not book learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Sam's are ethical knowledge that </v>

169
00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:49.674
<v Speaker 1>might seem to be a problem for our main </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters since none of them appear to </v>

170
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>have any moral intuitions whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus here,</v>

171
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.570
<v Speaker 1>do you have a ton of preorders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is your first cut of the profits.</v>

172
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Ho Lima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mum,</v>

173
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.753
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you sold the tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it help if they basically sold </v>

174
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

175
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.873
<v Speaker 1>there are branches of moral intuition </v>
<v Speaker 1>ism that suggest intuitions can change </v>

176
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.523
<v Speaker 1>while memorizing q may nod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zap eleanor into a perfect trim free </v>

177
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>angel.</v>

178
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.143
<v Speaker 1>It does open up a space for self </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection that was previously pretty </v>

179
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>close to off on kind of like a self </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement kick.</v>

180
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:25.764
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could help me out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teach me to get all horny for the </v>

181
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.124
<v Speaker 1>environment or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could also read the show through the </v>

182
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:31.974
<v Speaker 1>rules of Aristotle's virtue ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the best path to morality </v>

183
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.490
<v Speaker 1>is by following the example of virtuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

184
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>The good place does seem to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case for the power of friendship,</v>

185
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with this theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the beginning,</v>

186
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 1>there are no truly good people for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them to copy.</v>

187
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So Cheeky Teaching Aristotle is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty ironic.</v>

188
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Things get really intriguing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>eleanor goes back to Earth,</v>

189
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:56.124
<v Speaker 1>the end of season two from the get go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she acts way more morally than she did </v>

190
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:00.354
<v Speaker 1>in her old life.</v>

191
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Despite having zero memory of the lesson</v>
<v Speaker 1>she learned in the bad,</v>

192
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 1>good place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This suggests that those experiences,</v>

193
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>whether with books or with her friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>have ultra term moral intuitions,</v>

194
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.270
<v Speaker 1>even though she can't remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

195
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>If she falls off the ethical wagon once </v>
<v Speaker 1>or twice,</v>

196
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I quit eat my farts benedict </v>
<v Speaker 1>cumberbatch,</v>

197
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't take a lot of prompting </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Michael.</v>

198
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>The barkeep for her to seek out some </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

199
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Something about eleanor is undeniably </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

200
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.873
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met Michael makes a mean screwdriver </v>

201
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.990
<v Speaker 1>because of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the torture and stuff.</v>

202
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Although we aren't really going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about predestination in this video.</v>

203
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.303
<v Speaker 1>The ending of season two pretty much wax</v>
<v Speaker 1>you over the head with their answer to </v>

204
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>can people change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes they can.</v>

205
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.903
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this comes after an entire season of </v>

206
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.274
<v Speaker 1>eleanor in the gang making similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions over and over and over times </v>

207
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 1>802 every time Michael resets their </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

208
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>So although we can make our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>destinies changing habits,</v>

209
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 1>sure is a bitch or bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son of a bench.</v>

210
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.073
<v Speaker 1>Although we over here at wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the good place ultimately </v>

211
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 1>rejects the idea that teaching ethics </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly leads to more ethical action.</v>

212
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.333
<v Speaker 1>It's not totally clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gds lessons are no joke and the most </v>

213
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.084
<v Speaker 1>profound evidence of that is in Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who after just a few weeks of lessons </v>

214
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:17.421
<v Speaker 1>becomes a decent person Ga's or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>an honorary person.</v>

215
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 1>If anyone send to fight off </v>
<v Speaker 1>predestination.</v>

216
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 1>It's that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just one more thing,</v>

217
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>one philosophical inspiration in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good place that no matter how tangential</v>

218
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:31.164
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your main argument we just have to talk </v>

219
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:33.564
<v Speaker 1>about to show gets a lot of inspiration </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a wise crack favorite John Paul </v>

220
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Sarte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in season one the finale reveals that</v>

221
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.144
<v Speaker 1>they are all trash humans and the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>place is really an experimental </v>

222
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in the bad place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tahani Eleanor,</v>

223
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:49.794
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheaty are meant to torment each </v>

224
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 1>other for all of eternity.</v>

225
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.673
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demon architect who designed the </v>

226
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:55.894
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood has a theory that four </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully selected people will torture </v>

227
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.644
<v Speaker 1>each other far more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then butthole spiders were trying out </v>

228
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 1>the new butthole spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're enormous.</v>

229
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor unknowingly tortures cheaty by </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing him to make difficult choices.</v>

230
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.023
<v Speaker 1>His real life nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are trapped in a warped version of </v>

231
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal recurrence.</v>

232
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More philosophy that'll help us cheaty </v>

233
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>tortures to honey by refusing to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to pick her over eleanor,</v>

234
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>a reminder of the second best status she</v>
<v Speaker 1>had with her sister before her death.</v>

235
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I get tired of objective representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust my audience,</v>

236
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a hat.</v>

237
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well done to honey.</v>

238
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>The honey maybe knowingly tortures </v>
<v Speaker 1>eleanor by providing a constant reminder</v>

239
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:41.300
<v Speaker 1>of how much better she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so sweet,</v>

240
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.370
<v Speaker 1>teensy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you,</v>

241
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 1>your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

242
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

243
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.313
<v Speaker 1>And everything tortures Jason because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all he wants to do is be himself and he </v>

244
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:59.071
<v Speaker 1>can't even tell people his real name was</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

245
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.844
<v Speaker 1>he never got to see the Jacksonville </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars when their division title last </v>

246
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.323
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that a life with no </v>

247
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>floor to dance crew will ever be scarier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ask Arachnids.</v>

248
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a literal hell monster.</v>

249
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.793
<v Speaker 1>So what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another way to read the first season is </v>

250
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>a modern retelling of philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Paul Sartre.</v>

251
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.500
<v Speaker 1>No exit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

252
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.353
<v Speaker 1>Riffs on his famous idiom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell is other people with three bags </v>

253
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>locked in a room in the underworld who </v>
<v Speaker 1>make each other miserable through lies,</v>

254
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 1>love triangles and everything you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine from people who ended up in well</v>

255
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.653
<v Speaker 1>hell and in season one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neighbors of the good place managed </v>

256
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>to make each other very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very miserable.</v>

257
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.610
<v Speaker 1>It's important to clear up a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>misconception.</v>

258
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.803
<v Speaker 1>Hell is not other people because someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought their crying toddler to see </v>

259
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:44.134
<v Speaker 1>deadpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because in no exit and in the good </v>

260
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a turtle,</v>

261
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 1>neighbors will bring out what you hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>most about yourself.</v>

262
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.483
<v Speaker 1>The torture is predicated not by say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attending an eternal dinner party with </v>

263
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:55.744
<v Speaker 1>people who use the word mouthfeel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by letting those people decide how </v>

264
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 1>you see yourself leading to the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential as sin,</v>

265
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.213
<v Speaker 1>bad faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the similarities to no exit don't end </v>

266
00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 1>with the dope existentialists themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the characters themselves have a</v>

267
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>lot in common with their good place </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterparts.</v>

268
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.143
<v Speaker 1>I nez who describes herself as a damned </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch is pretty much the 1940s eleanor </v>

269
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.813
<v Speaker 1>except a lot worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She turns people against each other for </v>

270
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:22.144
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causes misery wherever she goes and </v>

271
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>thrives on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selfishness.</v>

272
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.153
<v Speaker 1>A stele is a high society socialite </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's obsessed with her own beauty and </v>

273
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.384
<v Speaker 1>wishes desperately for a mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She insists that she does not belong in </v>

274
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:35.194
<v Speaker 1>hell and for much of the play refuses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that she was a bad person on </v>

275
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I belong in the good place,</v>

276
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.780
<v Speaker 1>the real one with the good people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who do I speak to about correcting this?</v>

277
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Your role very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to speak to your manager is</v>

278
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 1>still snobbishness about the working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class is more than a little familiar.</v>

279
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 5>She's not used to dressing like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>plumber.</v>

280
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.154
<v Speaker 5>Rats that when you call a female plumber</v>
<v Speaker 5>or is it a a toilet suite for or clunk </v>

281
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 5>winch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In any case,</v>

282
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 5>that's how I'm dressed.</v>

283
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.913
<v Speaker 1>She also murdered a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to honey has probably never done </v>

284
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.083
<v Speaker 1>probably</v>

285
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 5>we don't make any sense together and yet</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm with you,</v>

286
00:15:13.691 --> 00:15:16.870
<v Speaker 5>I can really let my hair down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my depart can speaking of course,</v>

287
00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:18.820
<v Speaker 5>because I'd never had it up in the first</v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

288
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>G doesn't have quite the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlap with his counterpart Garsa,</v>

289
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 1>but there are certainly some character </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits that ring a bell.</v>

290
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Garcia is a coward which gets him </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

291
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And Gidi is terrified of making </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>

292
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>which is just its own brand of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice.</v>

293
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.630
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry everyone.</v>

294
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.493
<v Speaker 6>I just have some worries as well as some</v>
<v Speaker 6>concerns that could potentially turn </v>

295
00:15:42.131 --> 00:15:43.600
<v Speaker 6>into outright fears.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

296
00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:44.530
<v Speaker 6>there they go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

297
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there a few years now.</v>

298
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so remember how CIDI refuses to Pick </v>

299
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Tahani over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor totally happens and no exit.</v>

300
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.943
<v Speaker 1>Sadly there is no Jason God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That play would be so much better with </v>

301
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Jason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

302
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She having an orgasm?</v>

303
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.993
<v Speaker 1>Did I do somehow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the good place is initially a show </v>

304
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:04.964
<v Speaker 1>about hell being other people and also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show about the philosophy of </v>

305
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:08.744
<v Speaker 1>philosophies of which were discerning </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of also probably </v>

306
00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>something about Cacti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real question to end on is this,</v>

307
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>did watching this video on the ethics of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good place make you a better person?</v>

308
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you didn't learn anything from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video,</v>

309
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 1>well don't say we didn't try to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>

310
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Literally all of these lessons paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever said philosophy was stupid many </v>

311
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:33.644
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to make like your </v>

<v Speaker 1>favorite anxiety driven professor and </v>

317

<v Speaker 1>ethical,</v>

<v Speaker 1>everyday dirt bag to living an ethical </v>
