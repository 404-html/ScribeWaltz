1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people think that emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and art are sort of side shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human intelligence,</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.053
<v Speaker 1>the real essence of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's thinking logically if that were </v>

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:12.474
<v Speaker 1>true computers already smarter than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and because so much better at </v>

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>logical thinking that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.773
<v Speaker 1>it's actually things like being funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being sexy or expressing a loving </v>

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>sentiment maybe in a poem or an a </v>
<v Speaker 1>musical piece.</v>

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.993
<v Speaker 1>That's the cutting edge of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence has to do with the </v>

9
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of the NEOCORTEX and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>low levels,</v>

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things may seem cold and mechanical </v>

11
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.981
<v Speaker 1>cause where our neocortex can recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple objects and make very simple</v>

12
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.124
<v Speaker 1>decisions at a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dealing with concepts like the </v>

13
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>beauty of a poem by Emily Dickinson or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>or the ability to create a poem like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

15
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And we can come back to creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's an exercise in,</v>

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>in metaphors.</v>

17
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>And the NEOCORTEX is a metaphor machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's good at.</v>

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.933
<v Speaker 1>That's why humans are creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have this very large hierarchy </v>

19
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>where we have more and more abstract and</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex patterns.</v>

20
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill's on patterns below it.</v>

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between humans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say other primates is,</v>

22
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>so we have more of the Neocortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this big forehead,</v>

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.783
<v Speaker 1>we could fit it in the frontal cortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore have a higher number of </v>

24
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.223
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of levels of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the enabling factor that </v>

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that permitted the evolution of language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and technology and art and science.</v>

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.823
<v Speaker 1>We're going to create synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>neocortex is based on the same </v>

27
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually working on that.</v>

28
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.693
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've had hierarchical systems like </v>

29
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:49.404
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I helped pioneer a concept called </v>

30
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical hidden Markov models </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to what happens in the brain,</v>

31
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>but we only had a few levels.</v>

32
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.353
<v Speaker 1>The brain has a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels and all the way from recognizing </v>

33
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>edges of objects up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.353
<v Speaker 1>she's beautiful or creating a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting or work of music or scientific </v>

35
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>we will create artificial neocortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said,</v>

37
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>have a comparable number or a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

38
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.653
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the principal application </v>

39
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>will actually be to extend our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>neocortex.</v>

40
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>We have 300 million pattern recognizers </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the neocortex by my estimate.</v>

41
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.093
<v Speaker 1>That hierarchy we build ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of these pattern recognizers </v>

42
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>capable of connecting itself to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>neocortex is to build this hierarchy.</v>

43
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>We build that hierarchy from the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're born or before that,</v>

44
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly building it,</v>

45
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but we run up against this limitation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 million.</v>

46
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We'll be able to extend that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking the cloud,</v>

47
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do anything interesting with </v>

48
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a search or language or,</v>

49
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up a map or ask it a question.</v>

50
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take place in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes out to the cloud.</v>

51
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put these just really w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>gateways a gateway to the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put gateways to the cloud</v>

53
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>in our brains and have more than 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

54
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.433
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the cloud can give you a </v>

55
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>thousand or a million computers for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>10th of a second,</v>

56
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you need another billion pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognizers uh,</v>

57
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to access that in the </v>

58
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we're headed.</v>

59
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And it will be more intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>enabled to actually think in a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of hierarchies.</v>

61
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.934
<v Speaker 1>If you think that realized that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantitative improvement from primates </v>

62
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>to humans with a big forehead to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger Neocortex,</v>

63
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the enabling factor for language art</v>

64
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and music and science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

65
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>what kind of qualitative leap can we </v>
<v Speaker 1>make with another quantitative increase?</v>

66
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think where we're headed.</v>

67
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
