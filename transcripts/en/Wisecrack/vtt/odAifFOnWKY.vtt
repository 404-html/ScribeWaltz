00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:05.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll get a two month free trial.</v>

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlings </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I am your host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrick's wormy Lloyd.</v>

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.993
<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is the prestige </v>
<v Speaker 1>starring Huey Lewis and the newsy and </v>

7
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.064
<v Speaker 1>directed by neither one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film tells the story of Angier and </v>

8
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:30.754
<v Speaker 1>Borden to Earth Shamans who become </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivals over a simple misunderstanding </v>

9
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>about whether engineers wife should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive or not.</v>

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>They take turns injuring each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>frail,</v>

11
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.414
<v Speaker 1>mortal bodies and snooping in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's diaries for hot smut went ng or </v>

12
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:45.154
<v Speaker 1>finds out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Borden has a new incantation called the </v>

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Trans Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He becomes obsessed with finding out how</v>

14
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>it all works without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>sticking his foot in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries using a double.</v>

16
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>He conveniently finds wandering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 feet outside the building,</v>

17
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>but the double soon fines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has more of a passion for Trapeze,</v>

18
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.693
<v Speaker 1>so angier kidnaps fallon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borden's assistant who never speaks and </v>

19
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 1>whose face we never see clearly.</v>

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Somehow without ever looking at his face</v>
<v Speaker 1>or talking to him,</v>

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>borden relents and gives them a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tesla model three,</v>

22
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.263
<v Speaker 1>so angier drives is affordable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet stylish electric car across the </v>

23
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:20.254
<v Speaker 1>ocean to America to find Nicholas Tesla </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bully him into building a </v>

24
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:24.064
<v Speaker 1>transmogrification machine and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully uses the machine and </v>

25
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 1>becomes the biggest hippo on campus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes borden have very sad hippo.</v>

26
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>A very sad hippo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed Michael Caine is in this movie in</v>

27
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>case that wasn't clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borden sneaks backstage to investigate,</v>

28
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:41.074
<v Speaker 1>only to find engineers stupidly drowning</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a water tank like some sort of </v>

29
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:44.974
<v Speaker 1>noninvasive yes mammal borden is </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested and found guilty by reason of </v>

30
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.174
<v Speaker 1>proximity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will by the neck until borden is </v>

31
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:53.224
<v Speaker 1>murdered by the earth government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And only after he's fully choked out </v>

32
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.943
<v Speaker 1>does Sir Michael find out the Pepsi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Twist Angier is still alive and kicking </v>

33
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>with one of his feet at least who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still alive.</v>

34
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.953
<v Speaker 1>It seems angier has been suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself at the end of every performance </v>

35
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>leaving behind a fresh baked clone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live until the next one.</v>

36
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Then just as Angier is patting himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the back board and shows up and </v>

37
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:17.224
<v Speaker 1>performs his greatest trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting him with a gun by one Pepsi </v>

38
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>twist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the second for half price.</v>

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Borden is actually two twin brothers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>would trade off being borden and fallon,</v>

40
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 1>depending on who was having a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair day.</v>

41
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.003
<v Speaker 1>Angier bleeds out all his remaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and borden meets up with that </v>

42
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:35.794
<v Speaker 1>double crossing legend of stage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen to retrieve his daughter who is </v>

43
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:39.724
<v Speaker 1>also a part of this in the prestige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shamanism is a metaphor for </v>

44
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:43.834
<v Speaker 1>storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a euphemism for talkies at the </v>

45
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>start of the film cutter explains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of a magic trick.</v>

46
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>The magic trick consists of three </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>

47
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 1>This progression also reflects the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>act structure.</v>

48
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 1>The comprises the bulk of Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>

49
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.563
<v Speaker 1>Even Beverly Hills Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the pledge in petition shows you </v>

50
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>something boldly colored bird or man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of film.</v>

51
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>This translates to the introduction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and conflict.</v>

52
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Generally something to do with not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a date to dog prom.</v>

53
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Act Two is the turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second eight is cool.</v>

54
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.090
<v Speaker 1>The magician takes the picture which </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets its name because act one turns into</v>

55
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>act two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act two introduces complications.</v>

56
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advent of borden's trans man trick,</v>

57
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>which ignites and years descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a nonbinary openmindedness.</v>

58
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.553
<v Speaker 1>The turn culminates when engineers </v>
<v Speaker 1>activates the machine and the audience </v>

59
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>is left wondering when Batman is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show up.</v>

60
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I must leave the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

61
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>You sitting there and reading my diary </v>
<v Speaker 1>awaiting a death.</v>

62
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Somebody under act three is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prestige,</v>

63
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>which coincidentally is also the name of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film.</v>

64
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.163
<v Speaker 1>This is when the story gathers the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative threads and ties them into a </v>

65
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>neat little bowflex climaxing and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand flourish significantly.</v>

66
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>The structure is explained by a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>named cutter,</v>

67
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>a term that references an editor's role </v>
<v Speaker 1>in pieces of film together.</v>

68
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.723
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our editors are pieces of unwavering </v>

69
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>professionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how to do his job just as a shaman</v>

70
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:25.650
<v Speaker 1>distracts us with techniques like </v>
<v Speaker 1>needlessly vulgar imagery or a needless.</v>

71
00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>The attractive assistance pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant is most affective for Mr.</v>

72
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.263
<v Speaker 1>the film diverts the audience from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>twist even while dangling it right in </v>

73
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>front of our state of the art ocular </v>
<v Speaker 1>implants,</v>

74
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but child guesses immediately that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>birdcage trick used the twin cutter even</v>

75
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>comes right out and states it comes out </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end is the only way,</v>

76
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.283
<v Speaker 1>but the audience is so dazzled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>showmanship and the advent of </v>

77
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.614
<v Speaker 1>electricity that we are still gobsmacked</v>
<v Speaker 1>when borden finally explains all of </v>

78
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.374
<v Speaker 1>which goes to prove cutters theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether watching a magic trick or a </v>

79
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>movie or a donkey show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience wants to be fooled,</v>

80
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.843
<v Speaker 1>swept away by the narrative so that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be wowed at the end because no one </v>

81
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>goes to a donkey show.</v>

82
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.340
