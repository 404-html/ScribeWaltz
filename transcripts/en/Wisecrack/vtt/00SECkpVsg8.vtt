<v Speaker 1>Technologies,</v>

2
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.053
<v Speaker 2>the other field to you like to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and I was just in South Africa </v>

3
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:21.701
<v Speaker 2>interestingly where there is an issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>now between local South Africans,</v>

4
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:25.334
<v Speaker 2>especially black ones who come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>typically a deck around where they </v>

5
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.414
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a lot of education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blacks and Bob when refugees who have a </v>

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.433
<v Speaker 2>very good education and so they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of the it jobs except that </v>

7
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 2>they can't get working papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

8
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.733
<v Speaker 2>whoever's got control of the resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to use whatever excuse they </v>

9
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>can to keep other people out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

10
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 2>it's not men going around specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping the women out.</v>

11
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture of the old boys club,</v>

12
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 2>all these traditional things plus a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

13
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 2>learned aversion to technology in </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

14
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 2>especially among women and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all these things.</v>

15
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good role model</v>

16
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 2>and just time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem now with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just women,</v>

18
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:29.391
<v Speaker 2>it's men as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being interested in good,</v>

19
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>solid scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical,</v>

20
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>mathematical education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is key for all of this.</v>
