35
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:18.390

<v Speaker 2>the desert is what ultimately can man.</v>

36
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.753
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is a sign of Hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and truly is a good person who's </v>

37
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 2>just not cut out for that third life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's a warning that there ain't</v>

38
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>no stopping depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Island and Mrs Moss.</v>

40
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.950

42
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.973
<v Speaker 2>Hulu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have skipped town with all the </v>

43

<v Speaker 2>monies I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No escaping this showdown with death.</v>

44
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lou,</v>

45
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I would try to get out of dodge with all</v>

<v Speaker 2>but Jay Gatsby from the great gatsby by </v>

<v Speaker 2>He rents a shack next to the swag bag of</v>

50
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.354
<v Speaker 2>Jay Gatsby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mysterious playboy who throws dope as </v>

51
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 2>parties but never joins them.</v>

52
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.603
<v Speaker 2>It turns out gas be hosts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These rages in the hopes of attracting </v>

53
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>is back when honey dip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daisy Faye,</v>

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.833
<v Speaker 2>who lives across the bay from Gatsby's </v>
<v Speaker 2>crib with their douchey old money </v>

55
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:27.090
<v Speaker 2>husband Tom Buchanan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After being blue ball for years,</v>

56
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Jay and daisy finally started hooking </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

57
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.753
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately they do a good job at </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping it away from daisy's hobby who </v>

58
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>gets his revenge by telling her how </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatsby made all his bucks.</v>

59
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Bootlegging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that boy gatsby a hospital man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>another twist face.</v>

61
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 2>He decides to stick it out with her dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat.</v>

62
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Husband girl just can't handle the thug </v>
<v Speaker 2>life at Gatsby side.</v>

63
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I thought she was a ride or die chick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daisy.</v>

64
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.943
<v Speaker 2>I'm disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like they couldn't be worse </v>

65
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:56.934
<v Speaker 2>with team gatsby until holy time side </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch gets run over by daisy and the </v>

66
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 2>girl husband fades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gatsby was behind the wheel.</v>

67
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>That dead chick's crazy as hubby.</v>

68
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Hands down to gatsby's mansion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses him in his swimming pool.</v>

69
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.083
<v Speaker 2>It's game over for the great gatsby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did things go south for great </v>

70
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.793
<v Speaker 2>gatsby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was because his whole approach </v>

71
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.374
<v Speaker 2>to life will straight up whack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather thought he can buy his way back </v>

72
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.450
<v Speaker 2>to happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
<v Speaker 2>the gangster wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but daisy ain't one of his pants and </v>

74
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.633
<v Speaker 2>shirts that a human and the human heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the kind of thing you can buy on </v>

75
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go on the black market,</v>

76
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:36.094
<v Speaker 2>but that kind of crazy becoming rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make me any happier than being </v>

77
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>rich did for daisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

78
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.144
<v Speaker 2>just look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a top shelf social light on a </v>

79
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but her heart is busted.</v>

80
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.633
<v Speaker 2>Her marriage sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's shallow as even nick thought </v>

81
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Gatsby's Corny as view of daisy being </v>
<v Speaker 2>all perfect wasn't jiving with reality.</v>

82
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>The character was capable of achieving </v>
<v Speaker 2>their happiness they really wanted,</v>

83
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.643
<v Speaker 2>which might be why so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>compare the great gatsby to the failure </v>

84
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>of the American dream.</v>

85
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 2>What is the American dream?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

86
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:10.234
<v Speaker 2>it depends on who you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it boils down to busting your ass </v>

87
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.253
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get enough bread to buy whatever </v>

88
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.354
<v Speaker 2>makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the American dream holed up in </v>

89
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>practice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

90
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>in the Great Gatsby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the verdict is Hell No.</v>

91
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.973
<v Speaker 2>All the American dream got Jay Gatsby </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a death sentence for vehicular </v>

92
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 2>homicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

93
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 2>thanks for driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miss Daisy.</v>

94
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bilbo Baggins,</v>

95
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.773
<v Speaker 2>the Hobbit by j Dot r dot tolkien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bilbo baggins is a fat ass hobbit who </v>

96
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:39.784
<v Speaker 2>likes to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glaze up and do Jack to one day some </v>

97
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.103
<v Speaker 2>nappy wizard crashed his crib with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>team of dwarves and invited him to </v>

98
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 2>retake the lonely mountain and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice from the dragon smile.</v>

99
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must've been some Danville.</v>

100
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Va was cheap and after major grubbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>billable,</v>

101
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 2>joins the gang on a fantastic journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pack with stranger things.</v>

102
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Then we seen on stranger things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking problems.</v>

103
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.303
<v Speaker 2>Trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a magic ring that Bilbo pockets and an </v>

104
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>enormous dragon tiller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Top amount of blame.</v>

105
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Smile gets it correct and the doors </v>
<v Speaker 2>reclaimed their mouth.</v>

106
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.143
<v Speaker 2>The fastest thing you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my precious five armies hustle over and </v>

107
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:23.774
<v Speaker 2>start scrapping over the recovered loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This results in the climactic battle of </v>

108
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>the five arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily though bill on ducks,</v>

109
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 2>the dramas of Bob's the little shoddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces out,</v>

110
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 2>what only a small percentage is prize </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

111
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hurries home as fast as it's bad.</v>

112
00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Last can carry them because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

113
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>That money's going up in smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y'All.</v>

114
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>If you wonder why Bilbo didn't help </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself to more of the recovery swag,</v>

115
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.613
<v Speaker 2>it might be because so much of the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hobbit goes down because of good </v>

116
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:56.954
<v Speaker 2>old fashioned greed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consider the dwarves and session to </v>

117
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 2>reclaim the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something Thorn.</v>

118
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:02.744
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concealed leader of the dwarves </v>

119
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 2>regretted as he lay dying.</v>

120
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 2>If more of US valued food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheer and song above,</v>

121
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 2>hoarded cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says the bill Bilbo.</v>

122
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.463
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be a merrier world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just about everyone in the hobbit got </v>

123
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:16.844
<v Speaker 2>their minds on the treasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which might explain why talking chose </v>

124
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Bilbo is his main character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a Hobbit,</v>

125
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 2>there's a childlike innocence to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>living a simple life.</v>

126
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I like the dragons doors and who all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the money and the power was turned</v>

127
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:33.554
<v Speaker 2>off by greed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably tokens killed that we </v>

128
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>should as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

129
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Google does things up the middle earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>by swiping out.</v>

130
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 2>One ring from the Creta Gollum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's this?</v>

131
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Greed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't talking.</v>

132
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Setting up his future books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

133
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Because you know someone was seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar signs with that move.</v>

134
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.760
