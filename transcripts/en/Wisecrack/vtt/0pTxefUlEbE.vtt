00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.813
<v Speaker 1>Taking shots for anybody who may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in a position of where he's just </v>

2
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>one vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Granted the bigger vote getter,</v>

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>the biggest voter on the FMC is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.933
<v Speaker 1>we all were sitting in a world again </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we thought certain things were </v>

5
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:23.694
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And clearly when you Monday morning </v>

6
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>quarterback somebody might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:29.304
<v Speaker 1>we should have raised rates a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more quickly and made money a little </v>

8
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>less cheap and I would be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would say that today.</v>

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>But when you sat there were making those</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>

10
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:43.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that coming out of the 2000</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech bust and going through,</v>

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 and then having the Iraq </v>

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.723
<v Speaker 1>war come up in the Afghan war that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't have had a bit of a </v>

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>conservative view towards how rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so clearly in hindsight you'd say,</v>

15
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have made money less cheap.</v>

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to blame the Federal Reserve for</v>

17
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>what human beings are doing individually</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>is a bit of a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.033
<v Speaker 1>one thing we've done in our company that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a direct reaction to this is that we </v>

20
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>actually have written into our equity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bonus plans now,</v>

21
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>we just did it this year that if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a material misstatement or financials</v>

22
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.404
<v Speaker 1>is that we're going to recapture from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the executives the money we just gave </v>

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>because I thought it was just horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened,</v>

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>not because of any of the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect it,</v>

25
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>but these guys walked away when their </v>
<v Speaker 1>firms went and had a lot of suffering.</v>

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that to happen on my watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean we can't make mistakes,</v>

27
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're going to start see </v>
<v Speaker 1>compensation plans also alter,</v>

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.483
<v Speaker 1>but that's a free market force that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't imposed by any government is </v>

29
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>boards will do that.</v>

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Our board was very receptive to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You happen to have a management team </v>

31
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.704
<v Speaker 1>that wanted to do it and they saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in the news they didn't like </v>

32
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>and they change things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So through a combination of changes from</v>

33
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Reserve combination of state</v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing laws,</v>

34
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll get some of this behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

35
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that what's remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to think that you could have a war,</v>

36
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:14.694
<v Speaker 1>you could have nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have all these things happen </v>

37
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>where the global economy is still able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to absorb it.</v>

38
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.383
<v Speaker 1>And until very recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>main street wasn't suffering like Wall </v>

39
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:24.744
<v Speaker 1>Street was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our economy is still very robust and </v>

40
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll still end up being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with this tremendous impact.</v>

41
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll take awhile,</v>

42
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but I still think we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to end up in a good place at</v>

43
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.183
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day.</v>
