00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen again,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.390
<v Speaker 1>so I know we've talked about rick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>morty have bought,</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.433
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared has been lamenting the lack of </v>

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.514
<v Speaker 1>meaning in our asshole universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was time to give science a </v>

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>chance to shine light on everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite negligent grandpa and his,</v>

6
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented career savvy son in law.</v>

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 2>When do we need food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we're hungry.</v>

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.023
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see what psychology had to </v>

9
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>say about a problem we've all been </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking ourselves,</v>

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>is rick destined to be miserable because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his intelligence?</v>

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it better to be a jerry?</v>

12
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>If you asked 19th century author </v>
<v Speaker 1>Theodore dust way up ski,</v>

13
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>he would probably say no as he famously </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts it in the idiot.</v>

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.773
<v Speaker 1>It is better to be unhappy and know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst than to be happy in a fool's </v>

15
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky statement seems quite apt and</v>

16
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>describing the dynamic between Jerry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick.</v>

17
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Rick's despondency is driven by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that nothing matters.</v>

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>While a fool's paradise might as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>just be Jerry burry,</v>

19
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Visha Maillian simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

20
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>You just sold the apples campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who just sold the apples campaign?</v>

21
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Pluto or the titanic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

22
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the line for the bow,</v>

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>so it's Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.213
<v Speaker 1>We'll break it down in this wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>addition on the psychology of Rick and </v>

25
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>morty and being smart make you miserable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

26
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead for being the smartest </v>
<v Speaker 1>man in the universe.</v>

27
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly relatable as cocreator Dan </v>

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.103
<v Speaker 1>harmon puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're standing in line at that </v>

29
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:28.964
<v Speaker 1>bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you always feel like none of </v>

30
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>these people understand what a hurry I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

31
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 1>how much crap I have to do today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm up against.</v>

32
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.580
<v Speaker 1>We've all been rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as much as it sucks to admit,</v>

33
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.503
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us can also probably identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his self loathing and self </v>

34
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:42.344
<v Speaker 1>destructive behavior.</v>

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I hate myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I think I deserved to die.</v>

36
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.291
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

37
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.124
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

38
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Rick is practically omnipotent with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to invent,</v>

39
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.533
<v Speaker 1>transform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroy his way into getting </v>

40
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet despite all that power,</v>

41
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>he's miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

42
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>there's Jerry who's a little bit dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of bit discombobulated.</v>

43
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Jerry operates best when he doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think too much because when he does,</v>

44
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.903
<v Speaker 1>he generally makes things worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even when he's down in the deepest </v>

45
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:12.684
<v Speaker 1>of dumps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't seem to suffer to the same </v>

46
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.084
<v Speaker 1>degree that rick does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry may not have street smarts or be </v>

47
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:18.504
<v Speaker 1>able to hold down a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also not hitting the bottle or </v>

48
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>questioning his place in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his barber.</v>

49
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:28.221
<v Speaker 1>Happiness seems low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is it better to be a rick or a jerry?</v>

50
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>First?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at Rick.</v>

51
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.073
<v Speaker 1>His inner turmoil leaks out in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle and not so subtle ways like his </v>

52
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>famous catchphrase 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>

53
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just stupid nonsense.</v>

54
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.383
<v Speaker 2>Catchphrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not nonsense at all in my people's </v>

55
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 2>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means I am in great pain.</v>

56
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
<v Speaker 2>Please help me</v>

57
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>and obviously that way to real suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt in season two,</v>

58
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>but is it because he's smart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stereotype of the tortured genius is</v>

59
00:02:58.371 --> 00:02:59.204
<v Speaker 1>so deeply into pop culture that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should wonder whether it's overblown </v>

60
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:02.884
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roster of famous folks from history </v>

61
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:05.764
<v Speaker 1>who have suffered from crushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and the attention given to </v>

62
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:08.584
<v Speaker 1>the brilliance madness link by the media</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost makes it seem like depression is </v>

63
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.184
<v Speaker 1>a prerequisite to success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are obviously plenty of </v>

64
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>brilliant people who didn't suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness or were otherwise normal.</v>

65
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>They just aren't to sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

66
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Listicles about as say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who fell in love with a pigeon,</v>

67
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.813
<v Speaker 1>so is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does being a genius or even just pretty </v>

68
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>smart make you destined for misery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.143
<v Speaker 1>maybe one study as 3,700</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mensa members or people who were so </v>

70
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:35.434
<v Speaker 1>proud of their Iq scores that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined an organization to brag about it </v>

71
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.463
<v Speaker 1>if they were currently dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness more than a third said </v>

72
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>they were depressed.</v>

73
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>To put that in context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's five times the national average.</v>

74
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>If you rounded up 100 Mensa members and </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 regular people,</v>

75
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>about six to seven of those regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would probably be depressed.</v>

76
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 30 of the MENSA members would </v>

77
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.743
<v Speaker 1>be a few caveats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mensa members were asked to self </v>

78
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>report on their own wellbeing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those who reported feeling depressed,</v>

79
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.253
<v Speaker 1>roughly 10 percent didn't have a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling them they actually had </v>

80
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.374
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As anyone who spends way too much time </v>

81
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>googling symptoms knows the art of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis is far from perfect.</v>

82
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Plus are these medicines representative </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all smart people?</v>

83
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

84
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.983
<v Speaker 1>there might be a biological basis for </v>
<v Speaker 1>why highly intelligent people are prone </v>

85
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:20.644
<v Speaker 1>to depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her pinsky who random mensa study </v>

86
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>asserted the people with Iqs of 130 plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>have hyper brands.</v>

87
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.783
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can comprehend the world's </v>

88
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.554
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainties and possibilities more </v>

89
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>easily than people with non-hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

90
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>The whole hyper brain idea was based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the work of psychiatrist Dr.</v>

91
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.963
<v Speaker 1>Kasim Years Dubroski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who noticed his exceptionally smart </v>

92
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>patients had a tendency to overly </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate everything,</v>

93
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>especially the bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At times.</v>

94
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:46.864
<v Speaker 1>They also seem to experience deeper </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression compared to the </v>

95
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:49.774
<v Speaker 1>intellectually average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These traits were part of a group of </v>

96
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that he called over </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitability.</v>

97
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't see it as a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

98
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.413
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was predictive of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for being able to achieve the </v>

99
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>most ideal version of oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1972,</v>

100
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>he wrote one who manifests several forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of over excitability,</v>

101
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>sees reality in a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

102
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and more excitable manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debraski said that overexcited abilities</v>

103
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>come and five flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excessive energy or nervousness,</v>

104
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.733
<v Speaker 1>deep appreciation for things like art or</v>
<v Speaker 1>music being extremely curious or having </v>

105
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>an active mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a vivid imagination,</v>

106
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>and finally extreme and complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional experiences.</v>

107
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Rick is a textbook example of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

108
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.983
<v Speaker 1>He still slaying aliens on the rig at 70</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old freestyles award winning </v>

109
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.800
<v Speaker 1>tracks on a whim you gotta to use with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

110
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not appreciation,</v>

111
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but still can be just a tiny bit over </v>
<v Speaker 1>analytical.</v>

112
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.053
<v Speaker 1>I can prove it mathematically is capable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking up and inventing entire </v>

113
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>worlds and has seriously complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings for his family.</v>

114
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.373
<v Speaker 1>While it hasn't been tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some psychologists believe that people </v>

115
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>who think this way are more prone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called existential depression.</v>

116
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.883
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feelings of hopelessness that come from </v>

117
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>wondering whether life is ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless.</v>

118
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.913
<v Speaker 1>Dr James Webb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychologist who studies gifted kids </v>

119
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.883
<v Speaker 1>notes the well existential depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen to anybody following a </v>

120
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more likely to happen spontaneously</v>

121
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>to people whose intelligence is above </v>
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>

122
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.583
<v Speaker 1>Rick never comes out and says he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed beneath the weight of a futile </v>

123
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly comes close.</v>

124
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart people get a chance to climb on </v>

125
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take reality for a ride,</v>

126
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but it'll never stop trying to throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

127
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way off.</v>

128
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's bored senseless,</v>

129
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>virtually nothing in our own mundane </v>
<v Speaker 1>world impresses him,</v>

130
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but his intellectual prowess and </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination enable him to find temporary</v>

131
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>reprieve from boredom by way of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal,</v>

132
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>gun aided adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

133
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contrast this with Jerry.</v>

134
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.663
<v Speaker 1>Jerry possesses none of the traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist associated with hyper </v>

135
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:52.874
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you count getting super stoked </v>

136
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.530
<v Speaker 1>about rare coins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's little r two.</v>

137
00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 1>D Two is where the George Washington </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be done.</v>

138
00:06:57.731 --> 00:06:58.564
<v Speaker 1>Mobile Games or the titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does that mean he's inherently </v>

139
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>happier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get there,</v>

140
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

141
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.933
<v Speaker 1>here for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a minute to talk about </v>

142
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:07.394
<v Speaker 1>this video spots or better help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an online counseling service </v>

143
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who saw our booth </v>
<v Speaker 1>Burnham video,</v>

144
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.793
<v Speaker 1>you know jared gave him a girl and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>dug it knowing I like many people might </v>

145
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 1>be able to benefit from talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone on a regular basis.</v>

146
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.263
<v Speaker 1>He suggested I give them a try too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did stick around to the end of the </v>

147
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>video to hear more about my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the meantime,</v>

148
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>go to [inaudible] dot com slash wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

149
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>One to learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

150
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>back to Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

151
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>so does Jerry's daringness mean he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happier news,</v>

152
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

153
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:37.784
<v Speaker 1>some studies may suggest that being </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart makes you more likely to be </v>

154
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.174
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others suggests that intelligence gives </v>

155
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you the ability to unlock a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing doors in life that will make you</v>

156
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:51.251
<v Speaker 1>healthier and sometimes happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically money as pretty much all of</v>

157
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.244
<v Speaker 1>the studies on Iq and depression point </v>
<v Speaker 1>out being smart is associated with </v>

158
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>greater wealth and therefore better </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

159
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.103
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it gets hard to distinguish </v>

160
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.004
<v Speaker 1>what causes what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among the zillions of criticisms of Iq </v>

161
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>tests is the kids who come from well off</v>
<v Speaker 1>families are more likely to be tested in</v>

162
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

163
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between achievement,</v>

164
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:12.764
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligence throws a wrench in the </v>

165
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>idea that genius equals misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some studies,</v>

166
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>having a higher Iq has actually been </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with greater happiness.</v>

167
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.453
<v Speaker 1>One study looked at more than 6,800</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and found that I was positively </v>

168
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:26.834
<v Speaker 1>correlated with well self reported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happiness genius has long been </v>

169
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>associated with eccentricities and few </v>
<v Speaker 1>geniuses,</v>

170
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>fictional or otherwise can live up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the centricity of Rick Sanchez.</v>

171
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It's safe to say rick has a tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelm people with his intensity.</v>

172
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Some researchers have said this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmark of people with high Iq,</v>

173
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.593
<v Speaker 1>but these eccentricities may freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal minded people around them </v>

174
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>leaving our geniuses socially isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to roll with the normies requires</v>

175
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>minimizing that intensity which can lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a so called crisis of self,</v>

176
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>where conformity makes people feel lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>and confused about who they really are.</v>

177
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>One could argue that Rick's in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetual crisis of self on earth.</v>

178
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>He's forever an oddball and while that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to concern him too much,</v>

179
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.293
<v Speaker 1>it does mean he asked to compromise his </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature for the sake of his relationship </v>

180
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.534
<v Speaker 1>with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he finally shows up to </v>

181
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>

182
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.353
<v Speaker 3>I have no doubt that you would be bored </v>
<v Speaker 3>senseless by therapy the same way on </v>

183
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>board when I brushed my teeth and wipe </v>
<v Speaker 3>my ass,</v>

184
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.013
<v Speaker 3>because the thing about repairing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining and cleaning is it's not an </v>

185
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 3>adventure.</v>

186
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because jerry isn't an eccentric </v>

187
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.513
<v Speaker 1>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean he doesn't have his own </v>

188
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>problems fitting in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's seriously lacking in social skills.</v>

189
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Very stop networking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in space survival skills.</v>

190
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proud to share this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is I just kept crawling </v>

191
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>and kept working or skills of any kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

192
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 1>He's most successful in a career where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even know what he does.</v>

193
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.083
<v Speaker 1>Our Ya the Galactic Federation taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>over Earth's best thing that's ever </v>

194
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.364
<v Speaker 1>happened in his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got my six promotion this week </v>

195
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>and I still don't know what I do and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise so utterly incompetent that he</v>

196
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 1>has to beg his kids for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

197
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.793
<v Speaker 1>Todd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't just need a few hundred </v>

198
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>dollars to get through them on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some interviews coming up.</v>

199
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Something's going to come through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see it.</v>

200
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.213
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Rick points out after the worldly </v>

201
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.373
<v Speaker 1>Durley fiasco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason Jerry's able to get by </v>

202
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>is because everyone feels sorry for him.</v>

203
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You act like prey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a predator.</v>

204
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>You use pity to lure in your victim how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you survive.</v>

205
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Rick gets his way by intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fall.</v>

206
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Jerry relies on their mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's recap.</v>

207
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Some research suggests that the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains of highly intelligent people make</v>

208
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:29.784
<v Speaker 1>them more prone to depression mainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they see the world in a </v>

209
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>different way and are more intense than </v>
<v Speaker 1>your average homosapien,</v>

210
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.770
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a turnoff to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average joes,</v>

211
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:38.843
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they can leverage their </v>

212
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:41.394
<v Speaker 1>smarts for high paying jobs that enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to avoid the stresses of poverty </v>

213
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>and afford better healthcare means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a group,</v>

214
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overall.</v>

215
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.153
<v Speaker 1>To our original question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really better to know the worst </v>

216
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>and be unhappy than to be happy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool's paradise?</v>

217
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>To be a rick rather than a jerry </v>
<v Speaker 1>research says,</v>

218
00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.843
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a subjective asked question and </v>

219
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.394
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology doesn't have a concrete </v>

220
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:04.290
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

221
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Thanks psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to school for you,</v>

222
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 1>but for limited evidence that is out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

223
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.894
<v Speaker 1>so just that while you may be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to suffer from existential </v>

224
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>depression as a jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to live a better life</v>

225
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>overall as a rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which would you rather be?</v>

<v Speaker 1>thanks for sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this video was sponsored by the </v>

<v Speaker 1>online counseling service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better health.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We've talked about them before and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up sponsoring this video to better</v>

231
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:33.894
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes an inventory of what you're </v>

232
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:35.664
<v Speaker 1>looking for in therapy and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>match you with a licensed counselor </v>

233
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:39.024
<v Speaker 1>within 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a full time journalist who </v>

234
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>freelances for companies like wisecrack </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side,</v>

235
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>so it's really hard for me to commit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a set time for therapy every week.</v>

236
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>My therapist was extremely patient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally understood my crazy schedule.</v>

237
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Plus she was really accessible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive.</v>

238
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 1>One of the best parts about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to talk to your therapist</v>

239
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>over video conferencing if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

240
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 1>or if you just don't have time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can reach out to them over the phone</v>

241
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>or through messaging or through live </v>
<v Speaker 1>chat and you can get ahold of them while</v>

242
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>you were in your garage or your bed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever,</v>

243
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's all completely confidential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know we should make mental health</v>

244
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:13.834
<v Speaker 1>a priority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting over the stigma or just </v>

245
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>finding the time can be super </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging.</v>

246
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>So if you've been thinking about talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a therapist,</v>

247
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.270
<v Speaker 1>consider checking out better health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better health.com/wise,</v>

248
00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>crack one or click the link in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description below.</v>

249
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much for watching and see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time.</v>
