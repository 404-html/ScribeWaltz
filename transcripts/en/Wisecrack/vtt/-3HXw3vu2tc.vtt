00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy</v>

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.763
<v Speaker 2>who was a bartender in Washington named </v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Daley and I found myself covering </v>

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.743
<v Speaker 2>Wimbledon with him because I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports writer for two years at the </v>

5
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.043
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post because that's the job </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had open after my being a </v>

6
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 2>police report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 2>how did you get from being a bartender </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a columnist for the Chicago Tribune?</v>

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.403
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a funny bartender and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 2>the sports editors will come and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

11
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 2>you ought to try writing a column.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did it and then he did it again.</v>

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.533
<v Speaker 2>He did it again and he got this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens when you become a big </v>

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 2>shot editor or a big shot columnists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later,</v>

14
00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:51.634
<v Speaker 2>people ask you questions like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What advice do you have for young </v>

15
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:55.630
<v Speaker 2>journalists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately,</v>

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 2>if you're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to say,</v>

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.770
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get real lucky,</v>

18
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.443
<v Speaker 2>but number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe more important than number </v>

19
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to work like a nut.</v>

20
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.233
<v Speaker 2>To work really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard and to learn as much as you </v>

21
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.503
<v Speaker 2>can and to hope that you have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>talent almost equal to or equal to your </v>

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 2>sense of effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have to tell you,</v>

23
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.563
<v Speaker 2>as an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what always impresses me are the people </v>

24
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:31.171
<v Speaker 2>who are obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are gifted perhaps,</v>

25
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:33.574
<v Speaker 2>but I'm obsessed and they can't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine themselves doing anything other </v>

26
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:40.444
<v Speaker 2>than a political covering the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign or writing about the war in </v>

27
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Iraq or Afghanistan or for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.713
<v Speaker 2>writing fiction at the level of an Alice</v>
<v Speaker 2>Munro or George Saunders or whoever you </v>

29
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.893
<v Speaker 2>happen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those people invariably do it all </v>

30
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:00.634
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with a sense of passion and </v>

31
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>obsession that makes them as successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they are.</v>
