1
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>We humans live on earth that we all know</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can look up at the stars there,</v>

2
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>stars that are close to us and our stars</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are further away belonging to other</v>

3
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.234
<v Speaker 1>galaxies and the stars that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely far away belonging to </v>

4
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>extremely far away galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for about a century.</v>

5
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.873
<v Speaker 1>We know that we see that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galaxies which are islands of billions </v>

6
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>of stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far away.</v>

7
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:36.744
<v Speaker 1>Galaxies seemed to move away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that the light that reaches us </v>

8
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.963
<v Speaker 1>coming from those galaxies is what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the scientists called red shifted </v>

9
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>meaning something has been stretched in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those galaxies and us.</v>

10
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>What has been stretched is the distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>that separates us from those galaxies.</v>

11
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>As time goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the distances in space stretch,</v>

12
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>they expand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we call the expansion of the</v>

13
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:09.444
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not actually that those faraway </v>

14
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>stars or get x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's moved away from us.</v>

15
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>It is the distance itself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 1>There is more space and time in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them now than there was before.</v>

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Just to make that point clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you,</v>

18
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>when you are from on earth and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stars,</v>

19
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.193
<v Speaker 1>the expansion of the universe makes all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the far away galaxies look as if they </v>

20
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>were moving away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you imagined that you were living</v>

21
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else in another galaxy far </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and the universe from there,</v>

22
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.683
<v Speaker 1>all the stars and galaxies that are far </v>
<v Speaker 1>away would again be moving away from </v>

23
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To summarize,</v>

24
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>the expansion of the universe means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>distances increase with time.</v>

25
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>That's not something that is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy to understand.</v>

26
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine that the universe started</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the big bang,</v>

27
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>meaning that everything we can see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>outer space right now was condensed in a</v>

28
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>very much smaller volume a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

29
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Then somehow some energy got released </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything expended.</v>

30
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you universe group,</v>

31
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.653
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about that carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that somehow this </v>

32
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these blow up,</v>

33
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>this big bang thing should slow down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with time.</v>

34
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>When you have an explosion on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objects that are thrown away,</v>

35
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>they slow down because there is friction</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is something happening.</v>

36
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Objects don't keep moving in flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

37
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>They slow down in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be the same.</v>

38
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.213
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity should keep things from moving </v>

39
00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>too far away from one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If is enough gravity.</v>

40
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.084
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expansions should slow down after a </v>

41
00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there you go.</v>

42
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>In 1998,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.973
<v Speaker 1>astronomers discovered that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the other way around in space </v>

44
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.830
<v Speaker 1>looking at far away galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

45
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>they realized that the expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rate of expansion is accelerating.</v>

46
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>So there is a forest pushing away.</v>

47
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>The faraway galaxy is faster and faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>with time,</v>

48
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that gravity can </v>
<v Speaker 1>not explain.</v>

49
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Gravity pulls things back towards one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

50
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.373
<v Speaker 1>And this accelerated expansion means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is another force before that </v>

51
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>has been called dark energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This discovery of dark energy,</v>

52
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:49.021
<v Speaker 1>of the accelerated expansion of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe did change something already in</v>

53
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.894
<v Speaker 1>the way we picture the future of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe for a long time since we know </v>

54
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.693
<v Speaker 1>of the Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were basically two possibilities </v>

55
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.204
<v Speaker 1>for the future of our universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is that there is so much </v>

56
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>matter in that that despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion,</v>

57
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.433
<v Speaker 1>gravity would work like some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber band and would bring everything </v>

58
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:14.911
<v Speaker 1>back into what we call a big crunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the everything will be pulled,</v>

59
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>two words each other at some stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the expansion would go the other way</v>

60
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>around and we would have the the precise</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite as the big bang,</v>

61
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.693
<v Speaker 1>which was called the big crunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The discovery of the accelerated </v>

62
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.521
<v Speaker 1>expansion kind of ruled that possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the sense that gravity will never</v>

63
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>be strong enough to pull things back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a big crunch.</v>

64
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 1>We are the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are more into a scenario in which our</v>

65
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:44.854
<v Speaker 1>universe will keep expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will keep being getting bigger and </v>

66
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:48.394
<v Speaker 1>bigger forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what we can expect as of today </v>

67
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>for the future of our universe.</v>
