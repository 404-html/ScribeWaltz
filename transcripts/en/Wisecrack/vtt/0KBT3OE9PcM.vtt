1
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what it,</v>

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the only way to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's got this big problem which is so</v>

4
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.514
<v Speaker 1>much of it's a reserves are tied up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars so that if it were to cut off </v>

5
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the credit line in dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>how would it maintain the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>exchange rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fixed exchange rate that it has.</v>

8
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.053
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would only be able to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that if it allows the yuan to </v>

9
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's buying these,</v>

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>it's accumulating dollars because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell goods to the US,</v>

11
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>the dollar show up in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with those dollars?</v>

12
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can either buy treasuries with them,</v>

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you can hold them in green piles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank,</v>

14
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's really the same thing.</v>

15
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.223
<v Speaker 2>You can</v>

16
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>buy goods in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we would like them to do.</v>

17
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.133
<v Speaker 1>And if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think ultimately that's what </v>

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.113
<v Speaker 1>should happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately China will decide </v>

19
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>they will are a big player in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international economy.</v>

20
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>They will not be able to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed exchange rate.</v>

21
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:34.291
<v Speaker 1>They'll have to go to a floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange rate and they're a dollars that</v>

22
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>they own will depreciate because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won,</v>

23
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:39.964
<v Speaker 1>will appreciate relative to the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that in fact some of their nest egg </v>

24
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>will be eroded by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're not anxious to do this.</v>

25
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>They prefer the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the talk they have,</v>

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.663
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion about the US doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving this special drawing rights or </v>

27
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 1>some other kind of reserve currency </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't really what they want.</v>

28
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.463
<v Speaker 1>They like the status quo the way it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and I think they're going to </v>

29
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>continue this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 1>as long as they possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately are going to let the.</v>

31
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to let the economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

32
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just too big and economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

33
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't run it without allowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital flows in and out.</v>

34
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I think what's going to ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen if,</v>

35
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.943
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the Chinese economy can be opened so </v>

36
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:33.094
<v Speaker 1>that currencies are a convertible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese tourists can take money and go </v>

37
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:40.084
<v Speaker 1>see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese businessman can go in and buy </v>

38
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>property in the US and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.803
<v Speaker 1>and France and every place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it's just going to be a </v>

40
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.563
<v Speaker 1>blossoming global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be good for </v>

41
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:57.124
<v Speaker 1>everybody and I think the Chinese are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to ultimately drive that because </v>

42
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.284
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them do now and they don't </v>

43
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:12.661
<v Speaker 1>really have an easy way to spend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have an easy way to travel.</v>

44
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Japan was this big power in,</v>

45
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.350
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in grew so rapidly in the,</v>

47
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.243
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw Japanese tourists everywhere for </v>

48
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first thing we saw,</v>

49
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.560
<v Speaker 1>but we don't see this large influx of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese tourists as what we would expect</v>

50
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:38.824
<v Speaker 1>to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in New York is one place where you </v>

51
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>might expect to see a lot more than a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen.</v>

52
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>They travel all over China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to China and you see it's all the</v>

53
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>tourist spots are full of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all Chinese tourists because</v>

54
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>that's where they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

55
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't really go out of the country </v>

56
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.694
<v Speaker 1>very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's going to be a happy day </v>

57
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>for everybody in China and outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China when,</v>

58
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.403
<v Speaker 1>when this</v>

59
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.040
<v Speaker 3>orders are opened a little more.</v>
