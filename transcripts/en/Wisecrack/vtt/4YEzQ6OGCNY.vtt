00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.503
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week's artifact is the exorcist </v>

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>starring the lady who was in like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes of requiem for a dream,</v>

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>and the guy who was in like 10 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Star Wars,</v>

8
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>episode seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force wakes up.</v>

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>The film follows female human Chris who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a male name and her female daughter,</v>

10
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Reagan who has a Republican name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris is an actress even though that has</v>

11
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>basically nothing to do with the plot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Her daughter Reagan plays a game of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spooky monopoly,</v>

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.003
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is the inciting incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the film isn't exactly clear on </v>

14
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She starts acting like a millennial,</v>

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.853
<v Speaker 1>being irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything saying swear words and pissing </v>

16
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:58.854
<v Speaker 1>all over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She sees Chris Shuttles in thousands of </v>

17
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.184
<v Speaker 1>doctors to test Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she can afford because she's a </v>

18
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.034
<v Speaker 1>famous actress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the doctors can't find anything </v>

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>physically wrong with her other than her</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to transverse beyond the third</v>

20
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
<v Speaker 1>dimension and affliction that was common</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Milky Way Galaxy before we </v>

21
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:14.814
<v Speaker 1>developed a vaccine one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan takes it too far when she does </v>

22
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>the whole don't tell mom the </v>
<v Speaker 1>babysitter's dead routine.</v>

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Deceased was killed and then pushed your</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter's window.</v>

24
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.523
<v Speaker 1>So Chris decides it's time to give up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern medicine and start having a </v>

25
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:30.844
<v Speaker 1>little fun with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes on a romantic stroll with </v>

26
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:33.934
<v Speaker 1>father charisse across dressing mystic </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see if he can do that thing from the </v>

27
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about exorcism.</v>

28
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>He isn't sure if Reagan is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by a demon,</v>

29
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:42.904
<v Speaker 1>so he asks her and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that all he has to do is </v>

30
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>procrastinate for a little while longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like a crunchwrap supreme,</v>

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>he's good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

32
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:55.294
<v Speaker 1>the bureaucrats at corporate determined </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charisse is too much of a sexy hothead </v>

33
00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.583
<v Speaker 1>to perform the ceremony by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they fly in a ringer named Marin and </v>

34
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:03.844
<v Speaker 1>bump caris down to first alternate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two priests start vigorously </v>

35
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 1>exercising Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who luckily has been content to just sit</v>

36
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:11.494
<v Speaker 1>in her bedroom the whole time instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>making any attempt to leave or cause </v>

37
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 1>havoc or do anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demon Reagan responds by giving a gentle</v>

38
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:19.864
<v Speaker 1>razzing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which causes him to get the vapor so </v>

39
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.210
<v Speaker 1>marin kicks him out so he can go it </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

40
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.870
<v Speaker 1>maverick style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real maverick thing to do is die</v>

41
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:30.704
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings charisse back to times </v>

42
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>square one all out of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asks the demon to possess him instead</v>

43
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 2>it and</v>

44
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>the demon is so damn agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just does it with no hesitation.</v>

45
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Then charisse jumps out the window to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his death.</v>

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Seems like it could just float away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone else.</v>

47
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know how demons work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exorcist is a contemplation on </v>

48
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:54.144
<v Speaker 1>religions place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 20th century of Earth's </v>

49
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film was released during a time when</v>

50
00:02:58.231 --> 00:02:59.064
<v Speaker 1>religious obedience on the decline and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 seventies sexual revolution was </v>

51
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>on an incline since that provides more </v>
<v Speaker 1>torque and the opening of the film,</v>

52
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.363
<v Speaker 1>we meet Father Marin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncovering doodads on an ancient burial </v>

53
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.514
<v Speaker 1>site signifying that spiritual beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been buried in favor of modern </v>

54
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:16.864
<v Speaker 1>fidget spinners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris and Reagan are products of their </v>

55
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.474
<v Speaker 1>time ignoring religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it circles around them like </v>

56
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>an annoyingly persistent Hulu.</v>

57
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any religious beliefs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

58
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 3>What about your daughter know why</v>

59
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Chris Casually takes the Lord Son's name</v>
<v Speaker 1>in vain,</v>

60
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>daughter on her birthday for Christ and </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides football.</v>

61
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:38.484
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the only significance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday is that she doesn't have to work </v>

62
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.263
<v Speaker 1>on a Sunday this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus when Reagan's problem start to </v>

63
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:48.834
<v Speaker 1>manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody looks to secular explanations </v>

64
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.833
<v Speaker 1>such as her absentee father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned her father and separation </v>

65
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.793
<v Speaker 1>and scientific causes like cte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film explores the area between </v>

66
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 1>science and religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as homeroom father Charisse,</v>

67
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>who's religious training was overlaid by</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of med school in Boston,</v>

68
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.273
<v Speaker 1>well near Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially considered the idea of </v>

69
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>exorcism to be antiquated.</v>

70
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.020
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't happen anymore on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since when?</v>

71
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Since we learned about mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoia,</v>

72
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.743
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things they taught me at </v>

73
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Harvard.</v>

74
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.003
<v Speaker 1>His experience with his mother's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dementia predisposes him towards </v>

75
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric explanations for Reagan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomfoolery only water.</v>

76
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.683
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demon pretends to be hurt by tap </v>

77
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tap water,</v>

78
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.843
<v Speaker 1>which reinforces charisse has doubts </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the demonic properties of </v>

79
00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 1>fluoride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In contrast to Caris,</v>

80
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.710
<v Speaker 1>the developed Father Marin acts with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction that are racist,</v>

81
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:46.544
<v Speaker 1>grandpa set in his ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Kara starts to explain Reagan's </v>

82
00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:51.800
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marin stops him because of his extensive</v>

83
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:53.120
<v Speaker 1>experience with highlander.</v>

84
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.283
<v Speaker 3>I think it might be helpful if I gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>you some background on the different </v>

85
00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 3>personalities were begun as a benefit so</v>
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>

86
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 3>I'd say that seem to be three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's convinced that</v>

87
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Harris ultimately accepts the true </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of Reagan's possession.</v>

88
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.483
<v Speaker 1>The message being that religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintains its relevance in the modern </v>

89
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>world since both religion and the modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>world are equally absurd.</v>

90
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.713
<v Speaker 1>Through Keris is journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film explores the reason for evils </v>

91
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 1>existence and area of study called </v>
<v Speaker 1>theodicy.</v>

92
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.983
<v Speaker 1>The film specifically espouses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iranian model not to be confused with </v>

93
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.974
<v Speaker 1>the Iranian model or the training model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>St Aaron has believed that to achieve </v>

94
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>moral perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human must suffer evil and possess the</v>

95
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>freewill to choose goodness instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's boring.</v>

96
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Under this explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan's possession doesn't indicate the</v>

97
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.064
<v Speaker 1>absence of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather serves as a test of faith to </v>

98
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.274
<v Speaker 1>those around her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that babysitter she killed </v>

99
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Father Charisse is alienated from God </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of his mother's condition and as</v>

100
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:52.294
<v Speaker 1>burdens as a psychiatrist and the demon </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks these pressure points like a </v>

101
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.821
<v Speaker 1>Swedish massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zeus in the end,</v>

102
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Charisse confronts his evil head on by </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing a Christ like sacrifice,</v>

103
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>thus demonstrating is reunification with</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

104
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Reagan kisses a preceptor,</v>

105
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.463
<v Speaker 1>she is cured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film suggests that the ordeal may </v>

106
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:18.164
<v Speaker 1>bring her to faith as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also suggests she is in for a </v>

107
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:26.201
<v Speaker 1>lifetime of barking up the wrong dick.</v>
