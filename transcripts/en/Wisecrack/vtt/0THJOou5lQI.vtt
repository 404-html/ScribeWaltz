1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 2>the basic level it has to do with how </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells can divide many times.</v>

3
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was known,</v>

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late 19 seventies was that,</v>

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you copy a chromosome,</v>

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 2>the way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 2>mechanism copies of chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time a cell divides the very,</v>

8
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>very end bit can't be completely copied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 2>and so then the idea was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 2>the chromosomes are the telomeres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:34.254
<v Speaker 2>the chromosome ends would get shorter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shorter and shorter every time a </v>

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 2>cell divides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can't happen a indefinitely.</v>

13
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 2>There has to be some mechanism which </v>
<v Speaker 2>will balance that shortening.</v>

14
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the discovery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>telomerase a comes in.</v>

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 2>And so for any cell that has to divide </v>
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

16
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.673
<v Speaker 2>they need to have a way to balance so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's some shortening and some </v>

17
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.144
<v Speaker 2>lengthening and shortening and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>lengthening and the equilibrium is </v>

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 2>maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 2>so that the cells can then go on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>divide.</v>

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>We were very interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telomeres and chromosomes and,</v>

22
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 2>and how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.033
<v Speaker 2>how they functioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we really went to the source </v>

24
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 2>where there are a lot of telomeres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.153
<v Speaker 2>and this was something that Liz </v>
<v Speaker 2>Blackburn had done a number of years </v>

26
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 2>before when she had discovered the DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence that telomeres is made up of,</v>

27
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple repeated dna sequence,</v>

28
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sort of a monotonous many,</v>

29
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many repeats.</v>

30
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.413
<v Speaker 2>And she had discovered the telomere DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence in this organism called </v>

31
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Tetrahymena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a single celled organism,</v>

32
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.553
<v Speaker 2>very much like the paramecium that high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school students might go out to a pond </v>

33
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 2>and bring back some pond water and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the paramecium floating around.</v>

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Tetrahymena is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have 40,000</v>

35
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.603
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a very good source to be </v>

36
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 2>able to understand what the ends of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes were.</v>

37
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 2>So when we set out to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 2>is there an enzyme that can lengthen the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes to balance the shortening?</v>

39
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 2>We went again to Tetrahymena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 2>and you can just get these organisms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow them up in the laboratory.</v>

41
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 2>So we grow up a large batch of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the cells.</v>

42
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And then you spin the cells down in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrifuge.</v>

43
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 2>So you make a very compact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a collection of them.</v>

44
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And then break them open to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>insides of the cells out so that you can</v>

45
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>understand what is going on inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

46
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more that the discovery was</v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

47
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1984 and uh,</v>

48
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 2>it was clear that it was important at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

49
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 2>but it was important as a very basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>cellular mechanism.</v>

50
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

51
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.343
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a lot of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get a lot of people doubting </v>

52
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:48.274
<v Speaker 2>what the conclusion was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead it wasn't clear what the </v>

53
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 2>implications were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the 25 years that have intervened,</v>

54
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 2>intervened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.383
<v Speaker 2>my lab and Liz is lab and a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other labs throughout the world have </v>

56
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>contributed all kinds of different ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>from different avenues that have made it</v>

57
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>very clear now what the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications are.</v>

58
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.504
<v Speaker 2>And so there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are clear medical implications that we </v>

59
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>didn't know at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the beginning.</v>

60
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>We were just solving a puzzle because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were curious about how cells worked.</v>

61
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Although we knew that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental mechanism,</v>

62
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.103
<v Speaker 2>we weren't just doing experiments just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find out anything but rather to </v>

63
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.110
<v Speaker 2>really understand how a cell works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the 25 years in between really has,</v>

64
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:29.464
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed it to be clear what the </v>

65
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 2>implications of that discovery work.</v>
