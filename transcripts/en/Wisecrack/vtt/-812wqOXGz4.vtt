00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.700
<v Speaker 1>What's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.533
<v Speaker 1>the biggest challenge is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the method that has worked so well for </v>

3
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>economics is probably close to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits.</v>

4
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.153
<v Speaker 1>Economics has gotten a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mileage about by saying what would a </v>

5
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:29.041
<v Speaker 1>rational self interested person do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has been the core and for very many</v>

6
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>things that has been a very productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

7
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.593
<v Speaker 1>You learn enormous amount and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it serves as the basis not just for </v>

8
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:38.414
<v Speaker 1>abstract theories but for actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical analysis of behavior and of </v>

9
00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

10
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

11
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>in a way we've sort of,</v>

12
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.453
<v Speaker 1>Done what you can do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more and more the key issues in </v>

14
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.843
<v Speaker 1>are involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The limits of rationality involve the </v>

16
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.754
<v Speaker 1>places where people don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to assess all of the data they </v>

17
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>have where people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make rational choices.</v>

18
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>There is a rapidly growing field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral economics,</v>

19
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:10.064
<v Speaker 1>which is based what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no like an hour's </v>

20
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.283
<v Speaker 1>behavioral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that means to the economist is </v>

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>that means okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>people are apparently not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>maximizing your utility function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you columnists slight to assume,</v>

24
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:22.544
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good way to understand a lot of </v>

25
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:24.854
<v Speaker 1>human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they appear to be doing something </v>

26
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all of those approaches is trying</v>

27
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>to understand what people actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

28
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>that's behavioral and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're learning a lot.</v>

29
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more of,</v>

30
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be summarized in 10 words.</v>

32
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it wasn't done first.</v>

33
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>But I think we're learning a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so it's,</v>

34
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a research program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

35
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Boy influencing policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the labors of sisyphus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You A,</v>

37
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>you push it up a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes back down.</v>

38
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Each generation has to do its bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any,</v>

39
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will never be a point at which </v>

40
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>good economic analysis is automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into policy.</v>

41
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It takes each generation to try and push</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

42
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doing better.</v>

44
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I think this generation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is doing better now than it did 10 years</v>

45
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how,</v>

46
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it goes in,</v>

47
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.363
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next generation will feel the same </v>

48
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:18.104
<v Speaker 1>frustration.</v>
