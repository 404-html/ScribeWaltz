00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.833
<v Speaker 1>The pharmaceutical industry has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important role to play in American </v>

2
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a lifesaving industry.</v>

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.693
<v Speaker 1>This is the industry that we hope is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to control Alzheimer's </v>

5
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>and Parkinson's and these other diseases</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the elderly.</v>

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.141
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are dependent upon the pharmaceutical</v>

8
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs cost too much in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.803
<v Speaker 1>And we have to really move to generics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to get costs so that they're </v>

11
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:34.974
<v Speaker 1>affordable for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out a way so that the </v>

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:38.544
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies can make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable profit and people can afford </v>

13
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>their drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right now we're not there.</v>
