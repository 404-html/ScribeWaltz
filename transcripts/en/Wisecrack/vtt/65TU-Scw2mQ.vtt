<v Speaker 1>This video is sponsored by Intel and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>upcoming vr film Pale Blue Dot.</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Stay tuned after this video to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about Pale blue dot.</v>

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack corporeal.</v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Jared here on the set of earthling </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema,</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>so we just saw star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last Jedi and seems like it's pretty</v>

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>divisive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the critics seem to love it,</v>

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.883
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the least liked star wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies by audience reviews and the wise </v>

8
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:23.804
<v Speaker 1>crack team is similarly divided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of whether you loved it </v>

9
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:27.414
<v Speaker 1>or hated it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to deny that the movie took </v>

10
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:30.054
<v Speaker 1>some big interesting risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It deliberately plays with our </v>

11
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>expectations of what a star wars movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Rethinks the eternal battle between </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and dark and questions.</v>

13
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:39.834
<v Speaker 1>The efficacy of heroics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome is wisecrack quick take on the </v>

14
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>last Jedi and for the love of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>

15
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:45.834
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go watch it and come back the last July </v>

16
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>puts forth two major ideas.</v>

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let go of the past.</v>

18
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to end to.</v>

19
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preserve the light.</v>

20
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>So let's break down the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we let the past die?</v>

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Raise whole reason for seeking out luke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to getting him to join,</v>

22
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the resistance is to get answers about </v>
<v Speaker 1>her powers and her parents.</v>

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Rose holds onto a family heirloom that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminder of her deceased sister and </v>

24
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:10.764
<v Speaker 1>Leah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the murder of Han Solo is </v>

25
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>struggling to hold onto the memory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her son.</v>

26
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Other characters try to outright reject </v>
<v Speaker 1>their past.</v>

27
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.783
<v Speaker 1>Luke renounces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jetta convinced that the force is </v>

28
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.574
<v Speaker 1>about balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bunch of dudes with laser sticks </v>

29
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>convinced that they're the arbiters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ballads,</v>

30
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.003
<v Speaker 1>even decides to burn the temple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the foundational texts within luke </v>

31
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:30.144
<v Speaker 1>also rejects his legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legends of Luke Skywalker rose is </v>

32
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>compelled to part with her past by </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving away her precious family.</v>

33
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.463
<v Speaker 1>Ambulant Kylo Ren is killing off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory of Ben Solo and he also urges </v>

34
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.364
<v Speaker 1>rate to forget about who her parents are</v>
<v Speaker 1>or his own lineage and join him in a </v>

35
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're home.</v>

36
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Planets have a tendency to get blowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

37
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.413
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the film projects this </v>

38
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>message reasserting the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>embracing the past.</v>

39
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Even though Lucan Yoda burned down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gi temple,</v>

40
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.353
<v Speaker 1>turns out Ray has those foundational </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts still safely stashed in her </v>

41
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>belongings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luca firms,</v>

42
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:02.394
<v Speaker 1>he won't be the last Jedi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rose eventually gets her pendant </v>

43
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly,</v>

44
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>luke revives the legend of Luke </v>
<v Speaker 1>Skywalker when he confronts Kylo Ren,</v>

45
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>but more on that later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now onto the next lesson.</v>

46
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a hero preserved the light or </v>
<v Speaker 1>more specifically,</v>

47
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:17.424
<v Speaker 1>if being a hero means yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leroy Jenkins in the face of </v>

48
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable odds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't do that.</v>

49
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.343
<v Speaker 1>This is embodied by Poe who disobeyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>his orders and gets a bunch of people </v>

50
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:25.794
<v Speaker 1>killed and taking down a dreadnought and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finn who goes on a suicide mission to </v>

51
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>destroy the battering Ram Canon.</v>

52
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of this is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things are so dismal,</v>

53
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.523
<v Speaker 1>the battle can't be about winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best we can do is preserve the </v>

54
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:38.604
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is decidedly a different attitude </v>

55
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>than other star wars films which </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize the day being saved by Jed.</v>

56
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm hopping and swings and blowing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

57
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but with Vice Admiral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

58
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>skepticism of Po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last jet,</v>

59
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I takes a new approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fin suicide charges interrupted by roads</v>

60
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>who tells them that at this stage it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not about defeating the enemy so much as</v>

61
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:57.864
<v Speaker 1>protecting what you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that's exactly what Finn was </v>

62
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>trying to do and after admonishing po </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the entire film,</v>

63
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Vice Admiral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

64
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.413
<v Speaker 1>saves the transport ships by sacrificing</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself and ramming the first order </v>

65
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>cruiser more or less what Finn tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in space.</v>

66
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars.</v>

67
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hear more of that kind of</v>

68
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:16.444
<v Speaker 1>fan rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out our last episode of our movie </v>

69
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

70
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.323
<v Speaker 1>Show me the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's available wherever you get your </v>

71
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

72
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.264
<v Speaker 1>it's in Luke's arc in which we see these</v>
<v Speaker 1>two themes of the past and heroism </v>

73
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.194
<v Speaker 1>collide in a really interesting way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the movies shows luke </v>

74
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>incessantly refusing to get off his ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>and join.</v>

75
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.254
<v Speaker 1>The rebellion is even confronted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same call to adventure as </v>

76
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.680
<v Speaker 1>episode four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he also initially refused,</v>

77
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.523
<v Speaker 1>but this time he refuses for like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours precedent joining up with the </v>

78
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>cause like he did an episode four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does something else.</v>

79
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>He projects his image to the rebel </v>
<v Speaker 1>holdout echoing roses,</v>

80
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:48.934
<v Speaker 1>words he's not here to defeat the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to preserve the light by saving his </v>

81
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:53.344
<v Speaker 1>sister and stalling the first order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He projects his image and dies from the </v>

82
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:57.244
<v Speaker 1>tremendous energy the feet requires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why didn't he just go in person and </v>

83
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>kill Kylo or at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let Kylo strike him down all our ob one,</v>

84
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>because the galaxy doesn't need a hero.</v>

85
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>They need a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While layers call for assistance fell on</v>

86
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>deaf ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The final scene of the film details poor</v>

87
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:15.844
<v Speaker 1>exploited children of Canto bight </v>
<v Speaker 1>retelling the story of Luke skywalker </v>

88
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>surviving the impossible barrage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

89
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>This is where Luke comes to accept his </v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy and his past.</v>

90
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.673
<v Speaker 1>This revitalized legends of Luke </v>
<v Speaker 1>Skywalker will inspire more people to </v>

91
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>join the resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then layers cries for help.</v>

92
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Luke Skywalker as a symbol will do more </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the resistance.</v>

93
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Then Luke Skywalker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man ever could.</v>

94
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>There's another reason I find this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

95
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.673
<v Speaker 1>The original star wars was heavily </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired by Classic Westerns with its </v>

96
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>ensemble of outlaws and the lawlessness </v>
<v Speaker 1>of open space,</v>

97
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.873
<v Speaker 1>and in that tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson takes an idea that we see in </v>

98
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:51.874
<v Speaker 1>classic Westerns like the man who shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty valance and Fort Apache in both </v>

99
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 1>films and undeserving character is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enshrined in legend for the greater good</v>

100
00:04:58.961 --> 00:04:59.794
<v Speaker 1>of the West and the man who shot liberty</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance the false narrative that the </v>

101
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:03.274
<v Speaker 1>idealistic ransom stoddard killed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly unkillable liberty valance </v>

102
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>brings order to the west and in Fort </v>
<v Speaker 1>Apache,</v>

103
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:10.474
<v Speaker 1>the lie that captain Thursday died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a noble hero enables the US military to </v>

104
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>continue its duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have been a great name,</v>

105
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norman died more gallantly.</v>

106
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Luke skywalker may not have been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero people thought he was,</v>

107
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.630
<v Speaker 1>but belie created around his epic last </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>

108
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.653
<v Speaker 1>We'll go on to spark the next wave of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance in a quote that equally </v>

109
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:34.734
<v Speaker 1>describes all three movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A reporter in the man who shot liberty </v>

110
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:38.190
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclaims,</v>

111
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.570
<v Speaker 1>and the legend becomes fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Print the legend the last July even uses</v>

112
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the western tropes of a retired </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gunslinger,</v>

113
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>hesitant to enter back into the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

114
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll allow us to get Meta for a </v>

115
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.184
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another way of thinking about </v>

116
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:52.134
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The force awakens in dealing with its </v>

117
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.210
<v Speaker 1>own past decided to make a more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene for scene remake,</v>

118
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>a new hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unlike Jj Abrams,</v>

119
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>director Ryan Johnson,</v>

120
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:01.874
<v Speaker 1>did something much different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson took the fundamental building </v>

121
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.414
<v Speaker 1>blocks of star wars for saw audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations and deliberately subverted </v>

122
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>them every step of the way.</v>

123
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.593
<v Speaker 1>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last jet is similar to the empire </v>

124
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:14.294
<v Speaker 1>strikes back a wannabe jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I traveled to an isolated planet to be </v>

125
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignores their masters advice,</v>

126
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:19.784
<v Speaker 1>then finds out who their parents are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even swapped out billy dee Williams for </v>

127
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Bco del Toro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayal and all.</v>

128
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.740
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last jet,</v>

129
00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I are mentor refuses to help and raise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents aren't legendary Jetta.</v>

130
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:34.751
<v Speaker 1>I bought junkers who sold her for booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and snow just dies with no fleshed</v>

131
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>out backstory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first saw the gaping dark hole in</v>

132
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>the last jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

133
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this looks familiar,</v>

134
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>but unlike Luke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rey finds nothing there.</v>

135
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a deliberate misdirect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

136
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>and I'm still a little unsure about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

137
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>the powdery white base is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as hoth,</v>

138
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.193
<v Speaker 1>but covered in salt instead of snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little confused as to be very </v>

139
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>deliberate proclamation that the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>powder was salt.</v>

140
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>But here's what I've got salting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

141
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 1>In ancient history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salting land was a way to curse the land</v>

142
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:05.204
<v Speaker 1>and prevent anything from being built on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of it as salt is toxic to crops is </v>

143
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Johnson salting the earth of Star Wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lore.</v>

144
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>By redefining the resistance and what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be a hero.</v>

145
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.943
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the original trilogy which finds </v>

146
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>its heroes and princesses and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with quote unquote noble blood,</v>

147
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 1>the last Jedi Knight does a lot of work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move away from this narrative.</v>

148
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Our heroes are fin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a janitor rose,</v>

149
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:29.080
<v Speaker 1>a pipe mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ray,</v>

150
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.033
<v Speaker 1>who we learn is not the descendant of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful family lineage like the </v>

151
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Skywalker's but junkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unlike the rest of the film,</v>

152
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>which seemingly argues for preserving </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

153
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.673
<v Speaker 1>the last gi is moving away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative model that defined its </v>

154
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:43.394
<v Speaker 1>predecessors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think wise crack was the </v>

155
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:46.004
<v Speaker 1>last jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cinematic masterpiece or a medic </v>

156
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:49.084
<v Speaker 1>laurian dumpster fire also will be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ama for the first hour of this video </v>

157
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>gets released.</v>

158
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a pinned comment or you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask us about star wars,</v>

159
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 1>how we work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite Korean barbecue restaurant.</v>

160
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 1>My dog would eat or anything else you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know?</v>

161
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.913
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching guys </v>

162
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.193
<v Speaker 1>piece the last shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I's amazing story wouldn't have been </v>

163
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 1>possible without the technology needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to power it.</v>

164
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.703
<v Speaker 1>In that same vein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intel is paving the way for emotional </v>

165
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>stories in virtual reality dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation and technology and content.</v>

166
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Intel is supporting the vr film Pale </v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue Dot,</v>

167
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>allowing audiences to explore their way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through deep space where earth is just a</v>

168
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:23.804
<v Speaker 1>speck in the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inspired by the iconic Pale blue dot </v>

169
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:27.134
<v Speaker 1>photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film brings other worlds to life </v>

170
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>with visual effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound design,</v>

171
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:31.034
<v Speaker 1>and an original score under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction of indie filmmaker Eliza </v>

172
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:34.484
<v Speaker 1>mcnitt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film is part of Intel's commitment </v>

173
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>to empower vr filmmakers and as huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scifi nerds.</v>

174
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>We love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the film premieres in early 2018,</v>

<v Speaker 1>In this new medium,</v>

179
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.713
<v Speaker 1>we learned firsthand what it takes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a vr experience and how to </v>

180
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.234
<v Speaker 1>immersive you were in a story when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience has control over what they see </v>

181
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.853
<v Speaker 1>a wisecrack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly analyzing the ways we </v>

182
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.224
<v Speaker 1>experience stories and we couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more excited to see how vr filmmaking </v>
