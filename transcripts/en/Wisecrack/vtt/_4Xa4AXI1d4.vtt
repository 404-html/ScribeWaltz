1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.223
<v Speaker 1>I think the most famous piece of writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice that there is is right what you </v>

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's honestly,</v>

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best piece of advice </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

4
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood,</v>

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>most mistaught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most misinterpreted piece of advice that</v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so simple and so obvious.</v>

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>And I used to terrify me this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>write what you know,</v>

8
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I was dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Suburbia,</v>

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my house,</v>

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>dreaming of being a writer and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

11
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

12
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.094
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>what I know from childhood is I was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the couch watching TV,</v>

14
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>so I should simply rewrite a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of sitcoms for you.</v>

15
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I should write a book called what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and then I should write a book</v>

16
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>called Little House on the prairies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>at 5:00.</v>

17
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

18
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.663
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my childhood experience and </v>

19
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:43.914
<v Speaker 1>this didn't feel to me when I thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the books that I love and that kind of </v>

20
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:47.304
<v Speaker 1>stuff I wanted to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt like I am going to be very </v>

21
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>limited by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

22
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>What I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>this idea like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my family history,</v>

24
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm very American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know my family history.</v>

26
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>That's something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

27
00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new book I wrote a story about </v>

28
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>that very idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>

29
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>my family history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and to me as a kid out in suburbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the most thrilling life,</v>

31
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.074
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the central part of </v>

32
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>growing up for those of us who were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised suburban kids,</v>

33
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>was wanting to leave that town or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>world or that house,</v>

34
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you mom.</v>

35
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>like so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>when I thought about right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

38
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I really thought about it,</v>

39
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>understood like what it is is empathic </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>

40
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's advice about feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>most of the books that we truly love </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't exist because these things did not</v>

42
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>happen to the people that were writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

43
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>But why do we love those books?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they change this?</v>

44
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Why do they touch our hearts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they hold so much meaning?</v>

45
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.223
<v Speaker 1>Because they are truer than truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there is a great knowing within </v>

46
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>them and I think what's behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>What you know is emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like have you known happiness?</v>

48
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been truly sad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever longed for something?</v>

49
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.853
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point is if you've longed</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an Atari Twenty 600 as I did when I </v>

50
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>was 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>like all I wanted was that game console.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what I'm saying?</v>

52
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:58.464
<v Speaker 1>If you have felt that deep longing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can also be a deep longing for a </v>

53
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>lost love or for liberation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>country or to,</v>

54
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach Mars,</v>

55
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea.</v>

56
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>If you've known longing than you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>write longing.</v>

57
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>that is the knowing behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:14.784
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
