00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here.</v>

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the first time we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this season of south park,</v>

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>but for lack of a better phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to briefly recap,</v>

6
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:19.624
<v Speaker 1>the season so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south park has been exploring the </v>

7
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:23.470
<v Speaker 1>feeling of hopelessness in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

8
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>whether it's school shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>

9
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 1>priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage mobs or east suitors.</v>

10
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:28.444
<v Speaker 1>Nobody asks for South Park has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing us and exhausted population </v>

11
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Speaker 1>resigned to the fact that nothing can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>

12
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It seems like South Park is once again </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluating their legacy in the world.</v>

13
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Last season's southmark reflected on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their impact on the culture.</v>

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Most obviously scene in the episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>super hard.</v>

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Penis in which kyle be standing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show itself condemns the harmful effects</v>

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>of terrorists and fill up another </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

17
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.493
<v Speaker 1>The show,</v>

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.633
<v Speaker 1>although the previous season never made </v>
<v Speaker 1>a definitive statement whether or not </v>

19
00:00:58.861 --> 00:00:59.694
<v Speaker 1>south park is harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something interesting has happened in </v>

20
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the last few episodes with the recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduction of man bear pig,</v>

21
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Matt stone and Trey Parker seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking their efforts at self evaluation.</v>

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>A step further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

23
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>their new message seems to be more akin </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a full fledged.</v>

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.713
<v Speaker 1>We're sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to this wisecrack quick take </v>

25
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.180

<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>and of course spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

27
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who haven't seen season</v>
<v Speaker 1>tends episode man bear pig or just don't</v>

<v Speaker 1>It features our Gore warning south </v>

29
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children of the half man,</v>

30
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>half bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half pigments,</v>

31
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm spreading man.</v>

32
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:37.824
<v Speaker 1>Bear pig awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hear each of your kids take a pamphlet </v>

33
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.214
<v Speaker 1>and a bumper sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Gordon takes them on a farcical </v>

34
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:44.844
<v Speaker 1>hunting to a cave where the children </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost died even as he believed that </v>

35
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:48.504
<v Speaker 1>children have died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore gets super stoked about his </v>

36
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.444
<v Speaker 1>alleged defeat of man bear pig and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will in turn be super stoked on </v>

37
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:56.124
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

38
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.893
<v Speaker 2>I killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've saved the earth from certain </v>

39
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:03.490
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is</v>

40
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>for stoked on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

41
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Bear pig at that time and now was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super cereal.</v>

42
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Not so subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand in for climate change.</v>

43
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Gore had released his film an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient truth that same year,</v>

44
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and while one might view the joke of man</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear pig,</v>

45
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>to be mostly about Al Gore's attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking behavior,</v>

46
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.603
<v Speaker 3>you just use pig as a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention for yourself because you're a </v>

47
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 3>loser.</v>

48
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.913
<v Speaker 1>There are plenty of hints in the South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Park Cannon that Matt and Trey didn't </v>

49
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>take climate change too seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the season five episode,</v>

50
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>terrence and fill up behind the blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get this.</v>

51
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>

52
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.613
<v Speaker 3>My daddy is a geologist and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there actually isn't any concrete </v>

53
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 3>evidence of global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

54
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.583
<v Speaker 1>Global warming is going to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the Republicans are responsible and </v>

55
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>in the season nine episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days before the day after tomorrow,</v>

56
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>people wrongly accused a flood on global</v>
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>

57
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.843
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

58
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.260
<v Speaker 1>When in reality stand just crashed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boat into a beaver dam.</v>

59
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to our Fan Malcolm for </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing this out,</v>

60
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.463
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear pig also escapes from imagination </v>

61
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.560
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The implication being,</v>

62
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change is imaginary.</v>

63
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.063
<v Speaker 1>Now man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear pig is back and it seems like Matt </v>

64
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:19.910
<v Speaker 1>and Trey have changed their tune on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

65
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Do what you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude warned about this,</v>

66
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that Weirdo guy who came and told us </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened,</v>

67
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.763
<v Speaker 1>he was right in man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear pig is real and the show is now </v>

68
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:30.834
<v Speaker 1>going out of its way to not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate man bear pig with Gore's past </v>

69
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:34.891
<v Speaker 1>warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

70
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:36.660
<v Speaker 1>is it inconvenient?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

71
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I tried to warn you all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one took me theorial,</v>

72
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.020
<v Speaker 1>but to admit that they were wrong to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivialized his claims.</v>

73
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.973
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to making fun of climate </v>

74
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:45.954
<v Speaker 1>change blowhards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they have a different </v>

75
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:48.474
<v Speaker 1>target now.</v>

76
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no scientific proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no real evidence of a man bear pig.</v>

77
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Why are you trying to figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with scientists?</v>

78
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.763
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Trey also take aim at people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who waffle around about whether or not </v>

79
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:03.810
<v Speaker 1>they should worry about man bear pig to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

80
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Satan is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I start to worry,</v>

81
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a stark departure from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if global warming war real,</v>

82
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>which all proven scientific data shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

83
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>and it would take millions of years for </v>
<v Speaker 1>our climate shift to happen and as smoke</v>

84
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 1>fills the landscape of south park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they may even be referring</v>

85
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:23.964
<v Speaker 1>to the recent wildfires in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their apology decor is made most </v>

86
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>explicit in episode seven.</v>

87
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.160
<v Speaker 3>What more do you want from me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've atoned for my mistake.</v>

88
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gifting information at the time.</v>

89
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 3>You know even you were wrong about a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things you said would happen.</v>

90
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say they're letting up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the almost 43rd president of the US.</v>

91
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>He's still painted as a narcissistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Douche who cares more about the image of</v>

92
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.744
<v Speaker 1>himself as a heroic climate advocate </v>
<v Speaker 1>than actually dealing with climate </v>

93
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that the show recognizes the real</v>

94
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>threat of climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is to be done?</v>

95
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an adult in the town of South </v>

96
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is Jack Enter the game that I</v>

97
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>wish I was at home playing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Dead Redemption.</v>

98
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:04.924
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the adults from sergeant gates to </v>

99
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>randy to the cops to even Satan analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>score.</v>

100
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You're playing red dead redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two so good,</v>

101
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:13.474
<v Speaker 1>right are playing and for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're too busy escaping to their new </v>

102
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:17.664
<v Speaker 1>hyper detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild west second life to deal with </v>

103
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.140
<v Speaker 1>something as depressingly hopeless as </v>
<v Speaker 1>man bear pig,</v>

104
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.230
<v Speaker 1>not unlike the reaction to Sharon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode one.</v>

105
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.333
<v Speaker 3>Sheldon were shocked they were killed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a school where they were supposed to be </v>

106
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:30.804
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

107
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.363
<v Speaker 1>What else is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The adults of South Park are more keen </v>

108
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>on dismissing problems than addressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

109
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's going to kill everyone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna.</v>

110
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

111
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Well then I guess I don't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it,</v>

112
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.533
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man bear pig business makes some </v>

113
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:50.060
<v Speaker 1>pretty clever parallels to the idea of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>faustian bargain.</v>

114
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.793
<v Speaker 1>Bargain comes from the German tale of </v>
<v Speaker 1>faust who through a contract inked and </v>

115
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:55.784
<v Speaker 1>blood sold his soul to the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange for knowledge or worldly </v>

116
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>pleasures and isn't a convenient that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will miss.</v>

117
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.693
<v Speaker 1>Character comes back for this episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belsky and bargains are everywhere in </v>

118
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.854
<v Speaker 1>literature and film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes with the devil and sometimes </v>

119
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:09.884
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic premise is that one </v>

120
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>achieved some goal in exchange for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of horrifying fate,</v>

121
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.183
<v Speaker 1>like an eternity in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We soon find out that man bear pig is a </v>

122
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>fate sifting demon who made a faustian </v>
<v Speaker 1>bargain with grandpa marsh.</v>

123
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.803
<v Speaker 1>He's sacrificed the future for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet cars and even sweeter ice cream </v>

124
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.663
<v Speaker 1>here on the show is making a clever not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the argument that the economic </v>

125
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>prosperity of one generation has left </v>
<v Speaker 1>the current one.</v>

126
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.720
<v Speaker 1>As Stan says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're stupid.</v>

127
00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:37.554
<v Speaker 1>Band applied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of other old people made the </v>

128
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>deal with Mandera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peggy.</v>

129
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.073
<v Speaker 1>It's here because of their greediness </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening and the most tragic thing </v>

130
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:44.504
<v Speaker 1>about it and why we think this fits with</v>
<v Speaker 1>our previous thesis of this being the </v>

131
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>season of resignation is that Grandpa is</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the end.</v>

132
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.083
<v Speaker 1>Man Bear pig offers to leave south park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they agreed to give up red dead </v>

133
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>redemption and soy sauce,</v>

134
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.260
<v Speaker 3>he said they'll never come back again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to give up soy sauce and red</v>

135
00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:02.110
<v Speaker 3>dead redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two.</v>

136
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

137
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>why soy sauce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

138
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.604
<v Speaker 1>it's probably an illusion to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that soy farming to supply both humans </v>

139
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.264
<v Speaker 1>and livestock has cut down a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rain forest in the Amazon and the </v>

140
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:12.821
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partake.</v>

141
00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Take Mandera pick up on this offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the ride.</v>

142
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for everyone who wants to blame baby</v>

143
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>boomers on destroying the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids are just as greed.</v>

144
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Could we possibly talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>restructuring a new deal?</v>

145
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

146
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

147
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>episode ends with another foul skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>bargain.</v>

148
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.173
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally a contract that shifts the </v>

149
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:31.814
<v Speaker 1>chaos of man bear pig on to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually an economic takeaway </v>

150
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:38.540
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of an extra banality,</v>

151
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.493
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic building blocks of an economy </v>

152
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.373
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of smaller exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you some wood for your sheep and </v>

153
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>we've completed a transaction that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>made both parties happy.</v>

154
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>People agree to exchange different goods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and services.</v>

155
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world exists well as it does,</v>

156
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:55.963
<v Speaker 1>but an externality complicates our </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of two private citizens </v>

157
00:07:59.121 --> 00:07:59.954
<v Speaker 1>making a private deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because some exchanges have a </v>

158
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 1>spillover effect or some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>external consequences to the trade.</v>

159
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So if I pay Alec $5 to let woody on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors smelling my dog's gnarly poops</v>

160
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.053
<v Speaker 1>is an externality of that transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One they never asked for enter South </v>

161
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Park.</v>

162
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.113
<v Speaker 1>This faustian bargain with man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear pig is a literalization of how </v>

163
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:24.104
<v Speaker 1>externalities work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The town gets to keep soy sauce and red </v>

164
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:27.374
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone down the line has to deal </v>

165
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>with the external consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction.</v>

166
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Namely man bear pig slaughtering </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody when he comes back,</v>

167
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.343
<v Speaker 1>but more literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about how private consumption of </v>

168
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas,</v>

169
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red dead and soy sauce impact people who</v>

170
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>were never involved in that exchange to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

171
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life,</v>

172
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>cars produced carbon dioxide that enters</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire world's atmosphere.</v>

173
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.553
<v Speaker 1>Ice Cream uses milk from dairy cows who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fighting their way towards </v>

174
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 1>humanities demise and red dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.654
<v Speaker 1>there's probably an argument to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>about heavy metals and your playstation </v>

176
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:01.434
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park locates these externalities </v>

177
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.583
<v Speaker 1>geographically and sign here that man </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear pig has rights to the lives of all </v>

178
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>children in third world countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which points to how poor people,</v>

179
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.303
<v Speaker 1>especially in developing countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>way less able to cope with rampant </v>

180
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>forest fires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food shortages,</v>

181
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:16.794
<v Speaker 1>and rising sea levels and temporarily as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the externalities related to </v>

182
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>climate change will go on to be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other generation's problem</v>

183
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.920
<v Speaker 4>and you didn't get to what it would mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your grandchildren.</v>

184
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.660
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think I'd have grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even want children.</v>

185
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.650
<v Speaker 4>That's why I always came on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham.</v>

186
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Graham's</v>

187
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.273
<v Speaker 1>so has southpark matured this season by </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologizing for their dismissal of what </v>

188
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>now seems to be a very real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

189
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they may have recognized that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

190
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but they still leave us with a classics </v>
<v Speaker 1>health part.</v>

191
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mankind sucks and there's nothing we can</v>

192
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooray.</v>
