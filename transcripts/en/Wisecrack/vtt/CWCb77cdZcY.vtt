19
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.423
<v Speaker 1>After a year of training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memoria enrolls in the exclusive high </v>

20
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 1>school for will be heroes UAA academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of season one,</v>

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>he and his classmates come face to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some real bad guys.</v>

22
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.073
<v Speaker 1>The League of villains led by sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocky Tamara only for all might to save </v>

23
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

24
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of great moments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>season two,</v>

25
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but where this question of what it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a hero really comes to the fore is</v>

26
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:37.744
<v Speaker 1>during the stain art class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Eda 10 ya'll learns that his </v>

27
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>brother has been attacked by the hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer stain stain.</v>

28
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:45.094
<v Speaker 1>Believe that today's heroes are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with their own image than </v>

29
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.603
<v Speaker 1>actually doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

<v Speaker 1>determined to get revenge eda then </v>
<v Speaker 1>interns with the less than prestigious </v>

32
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:05.344
<v Speaker 1>normal hero in order to find stain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild Memoria Doria is stuck well with </v>

33
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>this guy and as sugar rocky on leashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hoard of biologically engineered super</v>

34
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:14.694
<v Speaker 1>villains on the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eda memoria and fellow classmate Tota </v>

35
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Roci managed to converge on stain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture him.</v>

36
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 1>The stain arch raises the question what </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes our obsession with heroism?</v>

37
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>According to philosopher Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire to be a hero is innate.</v>

38
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.003
<v Speaker 1>It's the desire to be the very best at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and ultimately to be </v>

39
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>remembered and thereby transcend death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of us aren't.</v>

40
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Heroes were Jerry's or some mentos at </v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

41
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.593
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becker tells us that we redirect this </v>

42
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>desire into society or what he calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural hero systems.</v>

43
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Bummed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not all might.</v>

44
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel special because in genomes,</v>

45
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 1>younger brother interns at your hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>agency sad.</v>

46
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>You're not always saving the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

47
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:55.834
<v Speaker 1>You can still feature on a TV talk show </v>
<v Speaker 1>panel because of your ridiculous </v>

48
00:02:58.271 --> 00:02:59.104
<v Speaker 1>costume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this kind of hero worship which </v>

49
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>stain opposes instead of believing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiro's must epitomize self sacrifice.</v>

50
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.013
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you doing [inaudible] sold </v>
<v Speaker 3>off all [inaudible] here you she don't </v>

51
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:14.874
<v Speaker 3>even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hygiene,</v>

52
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodily organ music.</v>

53
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.853
<v Speaker 3>She's a good mother.</v>

54
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.673
<v Speaker 1>Same rejects a society that treats </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes like celebrities paying them for </v>

55
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.024
<v Speaker 1>capturing villains and allowing them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use their status for lucrative side </v>

56
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:31.354
<v Speaker 1>hustles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same believes that being a superhero </v>

57
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>with an asterisk isn't being a superhero</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

58
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>And this argument isn't all that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

59
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>mirrors and idea that philosopher slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>senior men's models,</v>

60
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Derrida dubbed unconditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitality.</v>

61
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>To Derrida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unconditional hospitality is a pure,</v>

62
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>unbounded kindness and generosity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

63
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.163
<v Speaker 1>A law without law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he confusingly called it to dairy </v>

64
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.154
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True absolute hospitality cannot be </v>

65
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>imposed upon by rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duties,</v>

66
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>or laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they be legal,</v>

67
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even moral.</v>

68
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it stops being unconditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As one thinker put it,</v>

69
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>the law of hospitality is absolute in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it requires one to give all one has</v>

70
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>to another without asking any questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and posing any restrictions or requiring</v>

71
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.174
<v Speaker 1>any compensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we apply Derrida's logic to my hair </v>

72
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.043
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroes are only acting out a </v>

73
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.943
<v Speaker 1>conditional hospitality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you look over your care team may </v>

74
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.390
<v Speaker 1>accuse you of doing the bowl game though</v>
<v Speaker 1>he acts Sonia Super.</v>

75
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.763
<v Speaker 1>So I'll say [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hope this is particularly the case </v>

76
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.554
<v Speaker 1>with Eda who is so wrapped up in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire for revenge that he forgets what </v>

77
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>it means to be a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting others first.</v>

78
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And Dakota Hito [inaudible] will know to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know Tom,</v>

79
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>any wholesale when eat a stumbles upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>stain attacking native eva,</v>

80
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>is it really coming to the rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

81
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>he's implicitly making natives rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>contingent on him getting what he wants,</v>

82
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>killing stain and saying the perceptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>slasher tells it as it is.</v>

83
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Does Dad oh you to a muzzle Tuscan.</v>

84
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Here's the Kodo clady meets a toast </v>
<v Speaker 3>credo.</v>

85
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:35.981
<v Speaker 3>Say [inaudible] she cuddles [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>feudal kind of tumor.</v>

86
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this white team was really awesome.</v>

87
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Probably one of the best of the season </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to see it broken down by</v>

88
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:48.704
<v Speaker 1>one of our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out jeff over at mother's </v>

89
00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:51.164
<v Speaker 1>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just dropped a video analyzing all </v>

90
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.160
<v Speaker 1>the things that make this fight scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

91
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>So check them out in the link in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>

92
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You won't regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

93
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>this all goes to show what makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>medallia and all mites special.</v>

94
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>They're unwavering adherence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditional hospitality.</v>

95
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Madorie as willingness to sacrifice</v>

96
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.004
<v Speaker 1>himself for others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even without a quirk that originally </v>

97
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>drew all might the him,</v>

98
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.503
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

99
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And over the course of seasons one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

100
00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 1>we see memorial putting himself on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line over and over again,</v>

101
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>whether it's leaping into the fray </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the League of villains,</v>

102
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:40.900
<v Speaker 1>when all my team's down for the count or</v>
<v Speaker 1>arriving last minute to save Edo Stain.</v>

103
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Hell Madora can even use one for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>without essentially shattering the bones</v>

104
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:46.810
<v Speaker 1>in his body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's never stopped him.</v>

105
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stain recognizes this trait.</v>

106
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Memoria initially sparing him </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible],</v>

107
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but [inaudible] is only a pale </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison of what stain really wants to</v>

108
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:01.084
<v Speaker 1>fight the symbol of peace himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After stain saves Memoria from being </v>

109
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.780
<v Speaker 1>abducted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he declares Jamie,</v>

110
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.810
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

111
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.290
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no shale.</v>

112
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.133
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staying motivated to make a more just </v>

113
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>society will only let himself be brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>down by eight true hero.</v>

114
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.480
<v Speaker 1>The embodiment of unconditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitality all might.</v>

115
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Now stain isn't the main villain of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero academia,</v>

116
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but his impact has really felt in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seasons.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Datto.</v>

128
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.363
<v Speaker 1>Now to end this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to invoke a little more </v>

129
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.194
<v Speaker 1>becker here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember those cultural hero systems in </v>

130
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.164
<v Speaker 1>society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said they were all based on the </v>

131
00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:24.390
<v Speaker 1>denial of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we strive to get a raise,</v>

132
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:25.224
<v Speaker 1>fall in love or even start a family is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if we're only side </v>

133
00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:29.184
<v Speaker 1>characters and then pcs were desperately</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to feel special in our little </v>

134
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:33.054
<v Speaker 1>corner of the universe and be remembered</v>
<v Speaker 1>to becker though society would crumble </v>

135
00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:37.794
<v Speaker 1>if we ever realized how little our </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths actually mean to the unfeeling </v>

136
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:42.660
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

137
00:08:42.661 --> 00:08:43.494
<v Speaker 1>we have to desperately protect these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile artificial hero systems that </v>

138
00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:47.754
<v Speaker 1>make up society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This issue of confronting death becomes </v>

139
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:50.994
<v Speaker 1>even more pronounced in the world of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero academia where your everyday </v>

140
00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:54.624

<v Speaker 1>display when supervillains can appear </v>

141
00:08:58.411 --> 00:08:59.244
<v Speaker 1>and kill hundreds in an instant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does your average person go about </v>

142
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>living their life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as in our lives,</v>

143
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:04.854
<v Speaker 1>people can only create meaning by </v>
<v Speaker 1>building up images of heroes and for </v>

144
00:09:07.871 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 1>shipping and specifically the symbol of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace himself.</v>
