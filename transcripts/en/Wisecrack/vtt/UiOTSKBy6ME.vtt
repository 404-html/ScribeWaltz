00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.003
<v Speaker 1>Wisecrack jared here and today we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a game that was seemingly </v>

2
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:07.104
<v Speaker 1>made for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most overly philosophical </v>

3
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.391
<v Speaker 1>game ever seen a specimen that shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite near Automaton.</v>

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Near Automaton is a game about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>androids to be as in or not to be.</v>

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>The moody nine s and the jaded did a too</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>

6
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.754
<v Speaker 1>They fight adorable button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lethal machines and eventually each </v>

7
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>other on a futuristic earth where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line between right and wrong is taking a</v>

8
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.564
<v Speaker 1>vacation and is never coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world of New York automaton is </v>

9
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:34.404
<v Speaker 1>crawling with machines named after </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers who you must be friend or </v>

10
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.244
<v Speaker 1>be head mostly the latter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these wisdom loving death bots </v>

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>aren't always just throw away </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>They often point toward the complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy at the heart of the game,</v>

13
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.623
<v Speaker 1>at its core near Automata challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>players to consider how we make meaning </v>

14
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>and truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are as gamers and why video games</v>

15
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Welcome with this wisecrack addition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of near Automaton.</v>

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.173
<v Speaker 1>This video was made in collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an awesome channel called extra </v>

18
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>credits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could catch a link to them and their</v>

19
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:05.214
<v Speaker 1>video on near Automaton at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this episode and if you're visiting us </v>

20
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>from extra credits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome and be sure to subscribe.</v>

21
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch out major spoilers ahead.</v>

22
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>The story takes place on earth more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>9,000</v>

23
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>years in the future and follows two </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of Automaton.</v>

24
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>There's androids designed to hold human </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

25
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>but who eventually develop independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and machines were created by the</v>

26
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.394
<v Speaker 1>aliens that invaded earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Androids in machines fight a genocidal </v>

27
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.024
<v Speaker 1>proxy war on behalf of their masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though the player mostly controls </v>

28
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:33.684
<v Speaker 1>android characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choosing sides is not that easy because </v>

29
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:37.374
<v Speaker 1>by the games halfway point we learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>both humans and aliens have been dead </v>

30
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>for Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans were already extinct.</v>

31
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>When the aliens attack absent their </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators,</v>

32
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>androids and machines are forced to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning for themselves and if possible,</v>

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.113
<v Speaker 1>stop seeing each other as enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that both humans and aliens or </v>

34
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:55.104
<v Speaker 1>dead is not only a central plot twist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it encapsulates the games existential </v>

35
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

36
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>two B's opening line.</v>

37
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.173
<v Speaker 2>I often think about the God who blessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>us with this cryptic puzzle and wonder </v>

38
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 2>if we'll ever have the chance to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

39
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Might</v>

40
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.323
<v Speaker 1>as well have been polled right from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich Porn Stache Nisha who wrote </v>

41
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God remains dead and we have killed him.</v>

42
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.853
<v Speaker 1>Now I know the phrase God is dead gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown around a lot by internet edge </v>

43
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:22.774
<v Speaker 1>lords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what did Nisha actually mean before </v>

44
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Nicha many thinkers constructed reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a similar way.</v>

45
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and reason,</v>

46
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>we're all unfathomable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unchanging,</v>

47
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.540
<v Speaker 1>and universal concepts which stood above</v>
<v Speaker 1>or outside of humankind,</v>

48
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>like supernatural forces animating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and moving it toward progress.</v>

49
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.263
<v Speaker 1>In this view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans don't make and control meaning </v>

50
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some unreachable datey or universal</v>

51
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 1>principle which gives human action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning when Nisha declared God dead,</v>

52
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.793
<v Speaker 1>he criticized any system that locates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of meaning outside human </v>

53
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:57.934
<v Speaker 1>lives and popularize the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism is the belief that there is no </v>

54
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.824
<v Speaker 1>great metaphysical forest propelling us </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the world and making our lives </v>

55
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

56
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Existence can be beat and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>grander meaning to comfort us.</v>

57
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.623
<v Speaker 1>No puppet master to save us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know we can find each other in a </v>

58
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:14.584
<v Speaker 1>lot of pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no piece of media embodies it quite </v>

59
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.610
<v Speaker 1>like near Automaton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Androids and machines think they're god,</v>

60
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>like masters are literally above them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon and in space,</v>

61
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>but those gods are actually dead like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting for Millennia,</v>

62
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>dead and as we learned from Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eve,</v>

63
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>machines killed their alien overlords </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were static and unchanging,</v>

64
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>much like the unchanging day at ease and</v>
<v Speaker 1>morals that nature criticized.</v>

65
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 2>They were saying almost like</v>

66
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>humans died after the mainframe holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>their consciousnesses collapses.</v>

67
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.283
<v Speaker 1>Guess nobody made backups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the death of God is really about the </v>

68
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 1>death of a grand meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then our dead aliens and humans are only</v>

69
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.604
<v Speaker 1>one element of the games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greater message about meaning you kill </v>

70
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>some a philosophies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest heroes.</v>

71
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.003
<v Speaker 1>Some characters lose sight of a purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>in life and the game repeatedly builds </v>

72
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:12.510
<v Speaker 1>meaning around certain characters or </v>
<v Speaker 1>plots and then kills them off usually by</v>

73
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>the player's own hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each time this happens,</v>

74
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:15.684
<v Speaker 1>the player has to reevaluate where their</v>
<v Speaker 1>new meaning mission and direction is </v>

75
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:19.884
<v Speaker 1>going to come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even your hobby android organization </v>

76
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:23.304
<v Speaker 1>eventually dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your highs less like a god and more </v>

77
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>like acd government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know humanities dead,</v>

78
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:31.080
<v Speaker 1>but hide it from the other androids </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucked up,</v>

79
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:31.914
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your hot perfectly exemplifies the </v>

80
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:34.374
<v Speaker 1>Nietzschean point that even once God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six feet under society doesn't just </v>

81
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Political.</v>

82
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:39.804
<v Speaker 1>Social and psychological norms are left </v>
<v Speaker 1>over from prior belief systems and we </v>

83
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:44.214
<v Speaker 1>continue imposing these meanings on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another and ourselves to be at nine s </v>

84
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>spend much of the b play throughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reassuring one another.</v>

85
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:53.670
<v Speaker 1>That machines don't have emotions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>personhood,</v>

86
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.570
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just imitating human speech.</v>

87
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Even when all evidence points to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary child,</v>

88
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>no need for human masters to promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea.</v>

89
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>They do it to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Nisha,</v>

90
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:08.274
<v Speaker 1>the best response to a meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and a dead God is to create </v>

91
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>meaning for ourselves or what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as self making.</v>

92
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.073
<v Speaker 1>In near Atomico we encounter different </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines named after philosophers </v>

93
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.733
<v Speaker 1>engaged in this kind of self making each</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their own responses to the meaning </v>

94
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.114
<v Speaker 1>or meaninglessness of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are quite a few existentialist </v>

95
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>machines to be found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Paul as in Sartre,</v>

96
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>simone as in Diboll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Voila.</v>

97
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Pascal as in Pascal and Kierkegaard as </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Kierkegaard.</v>

98
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.313
<v Speaker 1>Each philosopher machine offers us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>glimpse into one way of pursuing </v>

99
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:41.334
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take John Paul the Avatar of John Paul </v>

100
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:44.154
<v Speaker 1>Sartre in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jp is basically a dark parody of his </v>

101
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:48.960
<v Speaker 1>real life self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Sartre,</v>

102
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:49.794
<v Speaker 1>loathed institutional recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Paul is kind of an asshole who </v>

103
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:53.634
<v Speaker 1>ignores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is devoted followers except for the </v>

104
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>pretty ones and eventually soft to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness to find meaning.</v>

105
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.773
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really misses him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before leaving John Paul highlights </v>

106
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.254
<v Speaker 1>the game steams when he throws around </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two famous Sartre isms like the </v>

107
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>existential slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence precedes essence essentially,</v>

108
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:10.844
<v Speaker 1>rather than some innate nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining who we are before we're </v>

109
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:14.264
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each individual first exists in the </v>

110
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>world and then develops meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

111
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.603
<v Speaker 1>It's all about radical freedom to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are through our actions and </v>

112
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>choices in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this everywhere.</v>

113
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>As machines transcend their intended </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose and find new meaning.</v>

114
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Even the pods proved that their nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from existence,</v>

115
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.210
<v Speaker 1>not a predetermined essence as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed self consciousness.</v>

116
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the characters in the game are,</v>

117
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 1>as Sartre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once suggested,</v>

118
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>condemned to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

119
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>condensed because without a higher power</v>
<v Speaker 1>or innate nature,</v>

120
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.124
<v Speaker 1>controlling our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we bear ultimate responsibility for our </v>

121
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.934
<v Speaker 1>decisions even as virality becomes super</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous and that's a tough place to </v>

122
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at machines like this,</v>

123
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:00.074
<v Speaker 1>sad angles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss who like many of the Games </v>

124
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:02.564
<v Speaker 1>characters is crushed beneath the weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>of figuring out what's right and he </v>

125
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>knows he bears full responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those decisions.</v>

126
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>The simone boss named after Simone de </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beauvoir,</v>

127
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.583
<v Speaker 1>a French feminist philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds a mirror to another aspect of </v>

128
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:16.064
<v Speaker 1>meaning making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>DEPA famously suggested one is not born </v>

129
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:19.784
<v Speaker 1>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let becomes a woman as the Simone boss </v>

130
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:22.664
<v Speaker 1>realizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way we create meaning in our lives </v>

131
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 1>is by constructing gender norms like </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and femininity.</v>

132
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.753
<v Speaker 1>She literally becomes a woman by </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructing herself and cannibalizing </v>

133
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>other machines to approve her beauty.</v>

134
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Both Deborah voir and her demented </v>
<v Speaker 1>avatar teach us to watch out less.</v>

135
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>We become monsters in our attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make meaning through gender norms.</v>

136
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Someones existential quest for </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection through beauty is highlighted</v>

137
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.714
<v Speaker 1>in her obsession with John Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has historical roots since debois </v>

138
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>and start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lifelong lovers.</v>

139
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 1>The character pascal packs one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest Nietzschean punches,</v>

140
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 1>though he's the Avatar of Blaise Pascal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mathematician,</v>

141
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and regular renaissance man.</v>

142
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't be more different than his </v>
<v Speaker 1>real life counterpart.</v>

143
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>As the pacifist leader of a machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>village,</v>

144
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.733
<v Speaker 1>Pascal puts a lot of faith and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate goodness of machines and </v>

145
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:10.484
<v Speaker 1>Androids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real pascal was a bit of a </v>

146
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>downer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike his idealistic Avatar,</v>

147
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>the Real Pascal thought humanity was </v>
<v Speaker 1>prideful,</v>

148
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unredeemable without God.</v>

149
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Our lives are filled with anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>

150
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have only one redeeming trait.</v>

151
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.373
<v Speaker 1>The greatness of human beings consists </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their ability to know their </v>

152
00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>wretchedness.</v>

153
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.323
<v Speaker 1>But Game Pascal comes around to the Irl </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pascal's viewpoint and maybe the games </v>

154
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:37.184
<v Speaker 1>darkest twist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The peaceful villagers suddenly start </v>

155
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>eating each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

156
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>even after setting aside his pacifism to</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend the children,</v>

157
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>they commit suicide anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained.</v>

158
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Pascal finally understands the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wretchedness of himself in the machine.</v>

159
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>When he despairs and asks you to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>him or delete his memory,</v>

160
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>the has to face their own wretchedness </v>
<v Speaker 1>two and make a tough choice.</v>

161
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Some characters in the near universe try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make meaning through new religions.</v>

162
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.683
<v Speaker 1>Take Christian existentialist Soren </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard who makes an ironic </v>

163
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>appearance as the worship leader of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small cult.</v>

164
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard believe that the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of one's freedom is to commit</v>

165
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>to certain meaning and make it true by </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting it in one's life,</v>

166
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>which he calls taking a leap of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

167
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>when some of QCC regards followers take </v>
<v Speaker 1>literal leaps of faith,</v>

168
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't turn out so well for that.</v>

169
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>There are so many other philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses we could talk about.</v>

170
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Call Gruen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conte ankles,</v>

171
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>and mark's Ernst Bloch Hagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the brothers Friedrich in August,</v>

172
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Schlegel Roshi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koshi Boko,</v>

173
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>she and Sochi are the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciations of Chinese philosophers,</v>

174
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Lao Tzu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confucius Moats,</v>

175
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:44.703
<v Speaker 1>and Juang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quanta was a taoist philosopher who was </v>

176
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 1>in the existentialism way before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

177
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.160
<v Speaker 1>He claimed existence is full of cycles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of light and dark life and death and joy</v>

178
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 1>and sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only by accepting these cycles including</v>

179
00:09:58.861 --> 00:09:59.694
<v Speaker 1>all the unpleasant stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we ever find contentment in life </v>

180
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>near Automaton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a cue from junk to bakes.</v>

181
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 1>These cycles right into the game played </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an extension of the games.</v>

182
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:09.714
<v Speaker 1>Existential themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mechanics emphasize the role of </v>

183
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:14.340
<v Speaker 1>cycles and repetition in creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

184
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.413
<v Speaker 1>Cycles are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Androids are caught in the cycle of </v>

185
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt,</v>

186
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly uploading to the mainframe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting new bodies to be is stuck in</v>

187
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>the cycle of killing dynastic and pod </v>
<v Speaker 1>one 53 it gives a sad spiel about cycles</v>

188
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

189
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Everything is designed to end.</v>

190
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.600
<v Speaker 1>It's all about returning to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning according to Nisha cycles.</v>

191
00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:35.434
<v Speaker 1>Dispel the myth of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Progress only makes sense if you have a </v>

192
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:39.424
<v Speaker 1>clear aim and if you're cool staying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a path that someone else laid out for </v>

193
00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:43.474
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nature hates that notion of </v>

194
00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:45.820
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

195
00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:46.654
<v Speaker 1>we should be critical of claims to </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress that rely on external meaning </v>

196
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.150
<v Speaker 1>or our unquestioned notions of right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

197
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.343
<v Speaker 1>The cycles and automaton disrupt this </v>
<v Speaker 1>false idea of progress and meaning not </v>

198
00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 1>only within the game universe but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the player in Automaton.</v>

199
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.290
<v Speaker 1>There is no clear goal or rather gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed throughout the game.</v>

200
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 1>And the whole point is that none of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters are on a predetermined path.</v>

201
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's no straight forward game </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

202
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.513
<v Speaker 1>Players literally repeat certain actions</v>
<v Speaker 1>or stories rather than moving linearly </v>

203
00:11:15.731 --> 00:11:16.564
<v Speaker 1>from one event to the next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game even ends with the suggestion </v>

204
00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:22.690
<v Speaker 1>that eight to a nine s will be reborn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight this battle all over again.</v>

205
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.030
<v Speaker 3>They are perpetually trapped in a never </v>
<v Speaker 3>ending spiral of life and death.</v>

206
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.213
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between cycles and nature </v>

207
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.943
<v Speaker 1>are most obvious in the games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiple play through structure in </v>

208
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Automaton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main play throughs a,</v>

209
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:37.931
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

210
00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:38.530
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n,</v>

211
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.363
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>r like chapters carefully sequenced and </v>

212
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.500
<v Speaker 1>building on one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often repeating parts of the same plot,</v>

213
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.363
<v Speaker 1>but through the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and powers of different </v>

214
00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:47.824
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes moving onto the next plot </v>

215
00:11:49.691 --> 00:11:50.524
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must complete a through d to get to </v>

216
00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 1>the main ending e with the credits which</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about in a moment.</v>

217
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.723
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tamatoa uses this structure to strip </v>

218
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:58.864
<v Speaker 1>meaning from the players themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put the idea of game progress </v>

219
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.213
<v Speaker 1>engaging players in their own nihilist </v>
<v Speaker 1>quest instead of the difference between </v>

220
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the first and second play throughs where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play as to be.</v>

221
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.174
<v Speaker 1>And then nine s in parallel stories in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first play as to be you learn the </v>

222
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.884
<v Speaker 1>aliens are dead and the machines we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been killing are actually sentience and </v>

223
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>

224
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course they could have just told us </v>
<v Speaker 1>this straight out,</v>

225
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:21.694
<v Speaker 1>but instead they make us relive every </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing we did to those poor bastards and </v>

226
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.044
<v Speaker 1>now we feel terrible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real importance of the first run is </v>

227
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:30.274
<v Speaker 1>to set up meaning yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are and why you're fighting the </v>

228
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:33.574
<v Speaker 1>bad guys and then snatch it from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is really driven home by the </v>

229
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the second play through </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you played from the perspective of</v>

230
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:40.804
<v Speaker 1>a machine red shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This opening seems designed to trigger </v>

231
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:44.074
<v Speaker 1>the players compassion and rob us of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning we use to make sense of our </v>

232
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>entire first quest.</v>

233
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Instead of creating a grand narrative to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain away pain and loss or instead of</v>

234
00:12:56.531 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 1>just giving up meat you suggest we say </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes to life.</v>

235
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.083
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying is an attitude oriented toward </v>

236
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the future that affirms everything from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past without trying to change it.</v>

237
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.563
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you had to live the same life </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and what Nisha calls </v>

238
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.494
<v Speaker 1>eternal recurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be super crappy if you </v>

239
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 1>thought life was about avoiding pain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

240
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.653
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying embraces suffering and the </v>

241
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>lessons if brings us without glorifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

242
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.873
<v Speaker 1>The game's final Nietzsche and middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger to progress and ultimate meaning </v>

243
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:25.444
<v Speaker 1>comes in ending eat here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Players literally have to kill their </v>

244
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 1>gods and make a difficult choice between</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>

245
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 1>which lets them save all their data and </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancement in the game and yes,</v>

246
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>saying which entails accepting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and be willing to start over as</v>

247
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 1>the credits roll and you battled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>names of the games,</v>

248
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:42.034
<v Speaker 1>designers and creators which are somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting that you messages from other </v>

249
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:46.204
<v Speaker 1>players around the world encourage you </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you're finally joined by their </v>

250
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>avatars who sacrifice themselves for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your success.</v>

251
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.833
<v Speaker 1>And I don't use sacrifice lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you discover at the end when you're </v>

252
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:56.254
<v Speaker 1>asked to do the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those avatars are there because in </v>

253
00:13:58.661 --> 00:13:59.494
<v Speaker 1>some other time in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe before you even started playing </v>

254
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.913
<v Speaker 1>other players finish the game and chose </v>
<v Speaker 1>to delete their data and game saves for </v>

255
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 1>the ability to eventually help you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>total stranger.</v>

256
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:09.844
<v Speaker 1>Complete the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we're asked what makes gaming </v>

257
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:13.534
<v Speaker 1>meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we believe in the myth of progress </v>

258
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>that what makes them meaningful is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completing them,</v>

259
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>saving our data and having achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>something once and for all or are we yes</v>

260
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:23.284
<v Speaker 1>sayers willing to start over from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and make the same choices and </v>

261
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe even the same mistakes all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>

262
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Are we individual automaton will only </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight for ourselves or is gaming about </v>

263
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the lessons we learn and engaging a </v>
<v Speaker 1>community?</v>

264
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.503
<v Speaker 1>Does one player deserve the sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>made by others and should we sacrifice </v>

265
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>ourselves for people who we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>or might not even like what makes gaming</v>

266
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:49.300
<v Speaker 1>meaningful is truly up to the player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you affirm progress,</v>

267
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.193
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you say to suffering and loss </v>

268
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:53.654
<v Speaker 1>instead all your saves in play get </v>
<v Speaker 1>deleted and you return to the beginning </v>

269
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>to do it all again or maybe you'll do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

270
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.300
<v Speaker 4>A future you must take for yourself.</v>

271
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.143
<v Speaker 1>See cycles as a game near Automaton </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself embraces suffering both of its </v>

272
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.424
<v Speaker 1>characters and its players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in order to tell a powerful </v>

273
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:17.594
<v Speaker 1>philosophical story as only an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactive game could does it pan out </v>

274
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.854
<v Speaker 1>like they hoped?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the game worth all the fields that </v>

275
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 1>elicits in an attempt to make its point </v>
<v Speaker 1>about meaning?</v>

276
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.103
<v Speaker 1>Well that's up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're one of the yes heirs who </v>

277
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice made my journey possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should know it means something to me</v>

278
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.143
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to me is because this ending </v>

279
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:41.830
<v Speaker 1>is a rare example of game developers </v>
<v Speaker 1>baking empathy into the game play well.</v>

280
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Video Games are on the surface all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving the world and helping people.</v>

281
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Most of them lack core components of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes acts truly empathetic.</v>

282
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>To learn more about how near Automaton </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks the mold.</v>

283
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.263
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to check out our </v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborators over at extra credits who </v>

284
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 1>are broken down the ending in a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>new light.</v>

285
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to tell him that wise crack sent</v>
