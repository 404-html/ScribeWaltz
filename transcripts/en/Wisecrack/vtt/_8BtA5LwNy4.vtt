1
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>We buy things for wildly different </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

2
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:16.681
<v Speaker 1>We buy things because they satisfy basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs like hunger or thirst.</v>

3
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>we buy products because they make us </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel good.</v>

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>They meet our needs of identity or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or needs of belonging,</v>

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.953
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>On some level though we buy everything </v>

7
00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>because it meets some needs that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.813
<v Speaker 1>And I think companies have kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten a shy about the reasons why </v>

9
00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:35.644
<v Speaker 1>people buy their products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest myth I have heard in </v>

10
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.830
<v Speaker 1>corporate America is the myth of the low</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest category.</v>

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>You'll go into a company that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>widgets and they'll say,</v>

12
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:45.454
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's a relatively low interest </v>

13
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:47.224
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that people aren't that </v>

14
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

15
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our biggest,</v>

16
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our only choice is to just slice it down</v>

17
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>and make it as cheaply as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>

18
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is any such thing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low interest category.</v>

19
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Every time we go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:01.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we study cleaning products when we find </v>

21
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>out that it's really about a mom caring </v>
<v Speaker 1>for her children and we study,</v>

22
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft drinks and we realize it's much </v>

23
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>more about kind of feeling like you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of identity and belonging with,</v>

24
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a group of people.</v>

25
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we study in engineering thermal plastics</v>

26
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.973
<v Speaker 1>and we discover that it's really about </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical engineers who use those </v>

27
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>thermoplastics feeling like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent in their job.</v>

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>There's always a human being in a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest factor associated with it.</v>

29
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told more than one,</v>

30
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:31.414
<v Speaker 1>ceo that the first thing he needed to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to walk around his company and ask </v>

32
00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:35.524
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think we have a low interest </v>

33
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>product?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

34
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

35
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.693
<v Speaker 1>And get rid of people who don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the stuff that you may can change </v>

36
00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>the world because it is changing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world whether they're noticing</v>

37
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.983
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
