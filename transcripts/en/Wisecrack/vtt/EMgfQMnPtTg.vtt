<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack jared here.</v>

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It all started when someone at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>office said,</v>

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>jared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to watch the boss baby.</v>

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.263
<v Speaker 1>So I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then perhaps reluctantly we covered </v>

7
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>it on our movie podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me the meaning and yes,</v>

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.713
<v Speaker 1>shameless plug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out using the link in the </v>

9
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.354
<v Speaker 1>description and let me tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something odd happens to you when you </v>

10
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>spend hours thinking about the boss </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

11
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.113
<v Speaker 1>Soon it became a semi ironic obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after it got nominated for an </v>

12
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.643
<v Speaker 1>Oscar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said we have to do a video on the </v>

13
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:44.584
<v Speaker 1>boss' pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to do something a little </v>

14
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:46.804
<v Speaker 1>different today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the boss baby is a </v>

15
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>deliberate and nuanced exploration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood psychology,</v>

16
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>it's more holy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie accidentally shows us how the</v>

17
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>way we currently think about love is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only ruining us but our future children.</v>

18
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>So if you thought the tide pod challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>was bad for kids,</v>

19
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>strap in for this wise crack condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the boss baby.</v>

20
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you care,</v>

21
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with a recap.</v>

22
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Tim is living a perfect childhood with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his family.</v>

23
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing but imaginary ventures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensively licensed lullabies,</v>

24
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 2>blackbird singing in the dead of night</v>

25
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.263
<v Speaker 1>until the baby shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly Tim's parents need to spread </v>

26
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:24.314
<v Speaker 1>the love around and tim finds himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling with not being the center of </v>

27
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:28.064
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Learns that this is no ordinary </v>

28
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an Oscar nominated boss baby.</v>

29
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>It can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold meetings and eat solid food.</v>

30
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.663
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tim tries to expose the babies bossy </v>

31
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:40.124
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a be suited baby Mike Freak is </v>

32
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Paris out enough that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.983
<v Speaker 1>throw the baby away or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the boss baby isn't going out like </v>

34
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.524
<v Speaker 1>that and outwit him at every turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Learns the baby is only around to </v>

35
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:53.174
<v Speaker 1>foil puppy Co's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious new puppy that threatens to </v>

36
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>make babies obsolete somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he agrees to help.</v>

37
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.713
<v Speaker 1>Tim and the Oscar nominated boss baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneak into puppy code to conduct some </v>

38
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.374
<v Speaker 1>corporate espionage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're madcap adventure goes off the </v>

39
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>rails and they end up in Las Vegas </v>
<v Speaker 1>saving their parents from a rocket ship.</v>

40
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>With the help of a tidal wave of </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppies.</v>

41
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.370
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the movie really about?</v>

42
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is easy.</v>

43
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 3>La La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

44
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:18.111
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

45
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:18.731
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

46
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la La.</v>

47
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about love.</v>

48
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Tim wants his parents love the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baby wants to win the market.</v>

49
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:28.864
<v Speaker 1>Share of love back from those Gosh Dang </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppies and the villain wants to steal </v>

50
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 1>love away from babies.</v>

51
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>No one will ever want a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

52
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.863
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

53
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 1>It all comes back to love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>

54
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.853
<v Speaker 1>Tim and the boss baby have a delightful </v>
<v Speaker 1>reunion when they realize that love is </v>

55
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>not a finite resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough for everyone.</v>

56
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.683
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a nice message and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyone who's ever had a high school </v>

57
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>crush knows we don't always get the love</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want.</v>

58
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Now I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

59
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>A silly kids movie has a reductive view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love.</v>

60
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>this view on love isn't just simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some might call it dangerous,</v>

62
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>like known Weirdo and everyone's second </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.</v>

63
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the cons fundamental ideas is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of lack.</v>

64
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.623
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lacan says that we spend our lives </v>

65
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>looking for meaning unity and peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those aren't real things.</v>

66
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.313
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to find them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the desperate search for them is </v>

67
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:23.794
<v Speaker 1>what makes people neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We developed social and psychological </v>

68
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.304
<v Speaker 1>disorders to cope with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite how badly we want life to be </v>

69
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never will be and it's this lack that</v>

70
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>defines tim struggle in the film curl </v>
<v Speaker 1>ICAN.</v>

71
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>It all starts with a childhood trauma </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the mirror stage.</v>

72
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.863
<v Speaker 1>When we're babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know what the hell is </v>

73
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>going on around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything is awesome.</v>

74
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>We're fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're taking care of and it's all good,</v>

75
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.993
<v Speaker 1>but eventually we see ourselves in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror and realized we're not part of a </v>

76
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>comfy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cozy world,</v>

77
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but just one little being in a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

78
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>that realization hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when we realize we're on our own.</v>

79
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>We see this phenomenon play out in boss </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby too.</v>

80
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little differently.</v>

81
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.603
<v Speaker 1>Tim is naive to the fact that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cater to his every need until </v>

82
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>the boss baby shows up and he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized.</v>

83
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.983
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the world isn't all about Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is parents only have a finite amount of </v>

84
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>love to give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moms.</v>

85
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Dad don't even know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love me.</v>

86
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do the math kid.</v>

87
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.503
<v Speaker 4>There's only so much love to go around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like these beats you used to have </v>

88
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:32.790
<v Speaker 4>all your parents love all their time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all their attention.</v>

89
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 4>You had all the beads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I came along.</v>

90
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.440
<v Speaker 4>Babies take up a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need a lot of attention.</v>

91
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.950
<v Speaker 4>They get all of you obviously didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to business school.</v>

92
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.693
<v Speaker 1>This theory that there isn't enough love</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone is the foundation of every </v>

93
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:51.594
<v Speaker 1>Oscar nominated choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boss baby makes tim tries to live </v>

94
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 1>with the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't.</v>

95
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>It can sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he tries to expose him so his parents</v>

96
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:00.264
<v Speaker 1>will get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No dice even jumps over a train and </v>

97
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>sneaks onto an elvis themed flight to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas,</v>

98
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.920
<v Speaker 1>all to make this baby go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

99
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Because the baby interrupted his notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how love works.</v>

100
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 4>Life was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life was perfect,</v>

101
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.733
<v Speaker 4>but as I drifted off to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something my parents said got me </v>

102
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do babies come from?</v>

103
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.563
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feeling of having your ideal </v>

104
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:24.844
<v Speaker 1>reality shattered may suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an essential stage of human </v>

105
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

106
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>instead of having tim move past this </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult stage,</v>

107
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the film doubles down on his childish </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>

108
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that love is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

109
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.403
<v Speaker 1>Tim writes a letter to the boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby sing that there's plenty of love </v>

110
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>for both of them as long as they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

111
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>It's heartwarming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for Lacan,</v>

112
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.893
<v Speaker 1>desire for love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for anything else is insatiable because </v>

113
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>the world will never be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the inevitable outcome of lack will</v>

114
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>never have the flawless complete life we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

115
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.793
<v Speaker 1>So we focused on specific things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects of desires or an individual </v>

116
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>problems as the source of our suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

117
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Tim's idea that love can or should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite is a fantasy,</v>

118
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>and boy does tim love fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the movie,</v>

119
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>we see him creating fantasies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the world around him.</v>

120
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>He uses those fantasies to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

121
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>to show his feelings and to grapple with</v>
<v Speaker 1>how love works.</v>

122
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.123
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned the whole movie is just a </v>

123
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>story adult him is relaying to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter to prepare her for a sibling on</v>

124
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>the way to story Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Sweetie,</v>

125
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that's how I remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

126
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I found out what there's plenty of love </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>

127
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Lacan might say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This poses a few issues by creating this</v>

128
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>bizarre narrative about a ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate baby who threatens to close on</v>

129
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>all the market share of love in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family unit.</v>

130
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Tim Is essentially demonizing his little</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

131
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>The deal with the fact that love is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact intranet,</v>

132
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.013
<v Speaker 1>but whether finite or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always going to want more and </v>

133
00:06:56.481 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll never get all the love we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This targeting of a single cause for all</v>

134
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.754
<v Speaker 1>our problems is something that Lacanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars and also regular people refer </v>

135
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>to as scapegoating.</v>

136
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we developed neuroses,</v>

137
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.944
<v Speaker 1>a cope with the feelings of isolation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that start with the mirror stage or we </v>

138
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>fabricate a story about a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation of babies.</v>

139
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.543
<v Speaker 1>The justify hating her little brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the same thing happened with the </v>

140
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.174
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis Francis formerly super colossal </v>

141
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:22.694
<v Speaker 1>big fat boss baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He becomes an evil psychopath and tries </v>

142
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>to steal love from all babies because </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fantasy of staying a baby forever is</v>

143
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>taken away from him and he blames all </v>
<v Speaker 1>other babies.</v>

144
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.313
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens when we expect a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect world and don't get what we </v>

145
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.824
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We act like babies but not necessarily </v>

146
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:39.854
<v Speaker 1>the Oscar nominated con and then Tim </v>
<v Speaker 1>does quite possibly the most </v>

147
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.333
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He passes his fantasy and all the </v>

148
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>neurotic baggage that comes with it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his daughter.</v>

149
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.993
<v Speaker 1>Inundating your daughter with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your basic desires will always be </v>

150
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:53.564
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled is well not great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will probably lead to some issues </v>

151
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>down the line like whatever happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>

152
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.930
<v Speaker 5>like get out of my face and make no </v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

153
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.630
<v Speaker 5>What are you wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

154
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.463
<v Speaker 1>what's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just that love is another one of </v>

155
00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:09.984
<v Speaker 1>the many things we're programmed to want</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doom to never get enough of not so </v>

156
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:14.394
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The con might say there is in fact a </v>

157
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:16.614
<v Speaker 1>secret way around the problem of love </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fantasy and it's also hidden in the </v>

158
00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:20.514
<v Speaker 1>Oscar nominated story of the boss baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the movie's ending gets right is </v>

159
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:24.444
<v Speaker 1>that the love between the brothers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the healthiest relationship we see in </v>

160
00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not because love is infinite.</v>

161
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.013
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because love depends on showing us </v>

162
00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 1>how much we're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what it's like to be</v>

163
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:38.280
<v Speaker 1>part of a fair and you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like to have a job.</v>

164
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Lacan famously referred to love as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give.</v>

165
00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:43.350
<v Speaker 1>What one does not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we love someone,</v>

166
00:08:43.351 --> 00:08:44.184
<v Speaker 1>we reflect their lack back to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We show them what they are missing and </v>

167
00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:48.084
<v Speaker 1>for Lacan that confrontation with LACC </v>
<v Speaker 1>is far more psychologically curative </v>

168
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>than covering over our desires with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies and scapegoats.</v>

169
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.423
<v Speaker 1>If we accept that definition of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to argue that the brothers </v>

170
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 1>don't live up to it from the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

171
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Their position not just as opposites but</v>
<v Speaker 1>as complimentary.</v>

172
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Boss baby is practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tim is a dreamer.</v>

173
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>The boss baby writes memos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Takes Action.</v>

174
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Tim has experienced love and values it </v>
<v Speaker 1>immensely.</v>

175
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Boss baby has never been loved and isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>too worried about it.</v>

176
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 6>I may look like a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I was born all grown up,</v>

177
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.030
<v Speaker 1>never had someone to love you.</v>

178
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't miss what you never had.</v>

179
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.390
<v Speaker 1>They each cover the other's flaws and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect them back to each other in a way</v>

180
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:30.820
<v Speaker 1>that helps them both grow and save the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

181
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.773
<v Speaker 1>It's the boss baby's motivational skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>that keep tim on the bike once he loses </v>

182
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:36.064
<v Speaker 1>the training wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The path to success is not a straight </v>

183
00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:38.944
<v Speaker 1>line templeton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather a wild ride and it's Tim's </v>

184
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:41.764
<v Speaker 1>imagination that allows them to defeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis Francis in the end by showing </v>

185
00:09:45.491 --> 00:09:48.310
<v Speaker 1>the other what they're missing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying those values,</v>

186
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.233
<v Speaker 1>they help each other grow into more well</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounded and healthy individuals per </v>

187
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.383
<v Speaker 1>lacan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love isn't meant to fill in the gaps we </v>

188
00:09:55.331 --> 00:09:58.060
<v Speaker 1>fill in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attempt to make life perfect.</v>

189
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.953
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what leads to neurosis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology and all kinds of other messy </v>

190
00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

191
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.353
<v Speaker 1>love shows us what we're missing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it okay because we see what is </v>

192
00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:10.570
<v Speaker 1>missing in someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it seems like we're going a little</v>

193
00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:14.890
<v Speaker 1>overboard on a movie about a baby who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow paradoxically a boss.</v>

194
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:15.723
<v Speaker 1>But this is an important lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real life is full of disappointment and </v>

195
00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:22.690
<v Speaker 1>few if any things live up to the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>we imagine,</v>

196
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's no reason to get depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you need to do is realize that things</v>

197
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.910
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to be perfect.</v>
