00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>The original impulse behind the book was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recognition I've had.</v>

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.413
<v Speaker 1>There are very many people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy what they do or perhaps in </v>

3
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:15.024
<v Speaker 1>how they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't enjoy the work they do and </v>

4
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>they sort of tolerate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>they got through the week and they wait </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the weekend.</v>

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Was a lot of evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By that.</v>

7
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.114
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies have shown that's massive </v>

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:25.944
<v Speaker 1>disengagement at the workplace and yet I</v>
<v Speaker 1>also meet people who love what they do </v>

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't really imagine doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

10
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:33.804
<v Speaker 1>If you said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you do something else for a </v>

11
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really wouldn't know what you meant</v>

12
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't what I do.</v>

13
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It's it's who I am and they couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>veterinarians,</v>

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>pathologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could be dancers,</v>

15
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could be teachers,</v>

16
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>homemakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

17
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>If you can think of a human activity or </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation,</v>

18
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>there'll be people who love it and live </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it and others who couldn't bear it.</v>

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.513
<v Speaker 1>So I was just always intrigued by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between these two ways of </v>

20
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:00.504
<v Speaker 1>being and the difference it makes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has really considered the </v>

21
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:05.704
<v Speaker 1>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has implications that are social and </v>

22
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.143
<v Speaker 1>if we have communities where launch </v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches of the population of simply </v>

24
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:16.644
<v Speaker 1>detach this engaged and interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it has big consequences if </v>

25
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>people are disengaged at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has large consequences.</v>

26
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:23.994
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting for a minute that if </v>

27
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.473
<v Speaker 1>every finds that relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will solve every social problem we </v>

28
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:28.914
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm certainly saying it would help </v>

29
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.103
<v Speaker 1>and my longterm convictions always be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all have the talents and the </v>

30
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>potential for engagement and we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore it.</v>

31
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.223
<v Speaker 1>I have fallen into using the phrase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other climate crisis and I think it has </v>

32
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.794
<v Speaker 1>a residence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by it is that we've become </v>

33
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>used to the fact now at least I hope we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

34
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>That is a crisis in the world's natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

35
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>but I also think there is a crisis in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our human resources and how we use them.</v>

36
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.144
<v Speaker 1>And one of the themes of the book is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make an analogy between the natural </v>

37
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>world and and the way our lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating.</v>

38
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.363
<v Speaker 1>And we tend to think that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>persuaded ourselves because we live in </v>

39
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:14.541
<v Speaker 1>cities like New York or la or wherever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

40
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.523
<v Speaker 1>somehow independent of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we're not where organic </v>

41
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>creatures we live and we die and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>we're subject to the own season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seasons of our own lives,</v>

43
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and just like the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me,</v>

44
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>human resources often buried deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneath the surface.</v>

45
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.863
<v Speaker 1>You can spend your whole life completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>oblivious to some talent you may have </v>

46
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>because the opportunity never showed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to discover it or to develop it.</v>

47
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.533
<v Speaker 1>So that's the broad aim of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to dig down more deeply into what it </v>

48
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:45.624
<v Speaker 1>means to be in your element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the book is really focused on </v>

49
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>providing some practical support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and exercises.</v>

50
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.133
<v Speaker 1>Then if that's the journey that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in taking for yourself or for </v>

51
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>people who know and love your children </v>
<v Speaker 1>or people you work with,</v>

52
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>then I hope you'll stay</v>

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 2>with us here on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on big thing.</v>

54
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.733
