<v Speaker 1>Whether you need a domain,</v>

<v Speaker 1>make it with squarespace.</v>

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>A wise crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately needs a haircut.</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.094
<v Speaker 1>Jared here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we just saw black panther and got to </v>

6
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.914
<v Speaker 1>say it's probably one of the better </v>
<v Speaker 1>marvel films and the element that </v>

7
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>elevates it is something rarely seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mcu,</v>

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.083
<v Speaker 1>a complex antagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the best marvel films feature </v>

9
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>villains that fit the same generic </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.713
<v Speaker 1>try to take over the world for reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are rarely more complex than they </v>

11
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>are for Pinky and the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing we do every night,</v>

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>pinky try to take over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just what marvel villains do.</v>

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Eagle wants to take over the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's egotistical.</v>

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.003
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to take over as guard so she can </v>

15
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.014
<v Speaker 1>then take over the nine realms and hydro</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to take over the world because </v>

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>they're literal Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but killmonger is different.</v>

17
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>He's got compelling and relatable </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>

18
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 1>motivating his attempt to global </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquests.</v>

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So much so that we found ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking,</v>

20
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>is killmonger the best superhero villain</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the joker?</v>

21
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wise crack quick take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>marbles.</v>

22
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Black Panther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what motivates,</v>

24
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>kill longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply put,</v>

25
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.613
<v Speaker 1>he's seeking retribution for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>injustices leveled against people of </v>

26
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.124
<v Speaker 1>African descent by Western countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes the obvious like slavery </v>

27
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>and segregation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also other wrongs,</v>

28
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.443
<v Speaker 1>including redlining in which unfair </v>
<v Speaker 1>government loan policies for blacks to </v>

29
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>live in ghettos and racial profiling by </v>
<v Speaker 1>police in which increased patrolling and</v>

30
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>impoverished black neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributes to the mass incarceration of</v>

31
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>black men in America apply to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>current Black Panther writer,</v>

32
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Tanahashi coats often writes about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

33
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.613
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in hearing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how coats and other Afro </v>

34
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic views are being expressed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop culture,</v>

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I recommend listening to the get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode of our movie podcast.</v>

36
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.493
<v Speaker 1>Show me the meaning anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though these injustices are only </v>

37
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.494
<v Speaker 1>obliquely alluded to in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a humorous bit with sheree </v>

38
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>calling Bilbo a colonizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They formed the obvious subtext.</v>

39
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.233
<v Speaker 1>Every time killmonger mentions the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plight of blacks living outside of </v>

40
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Wakanda apply that will conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could presumably fix,</v>

41
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>and this leads to one of the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>central questions should Macondo,</v>

42
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.364
<v Speaker 1>do more to address the inequities of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world initially that will </v>

43
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.264
<v Speaker 1>condoms want to maintain their isolation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is politics and killmonger wants to </v>

44
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:25.614
<v Speaker 1>conquer the oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thereby colonizing the old colonial </v>

45
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.064
<v Speaker 1>powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This juxtaposition of isolationism </v>

46
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:32.124
<v Speaker 1>versus colonialism is one of several </v>
<v Speaker 1>false dichotomies introduced by </v>

47
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>killmonger that characterize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thematic structure of Black Panther.</v>

48
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>So what do I mean by false dichotomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the film?</v>

49
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.793
<v Speaker 1>Killmonger prompts a number of binaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as isolationism versus colonialism </v>

50
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>or traditionalism versus progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the film ultimately reveals,</v>

51
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.103
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to look at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues as a choice between two </v>

52
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:56.184
<v Speaker 1>absolutes.</v>

53
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.143
<v Speaker 1>There's usually a third way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a middle path between two extremes or </v>

54
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.354
<v Speaker 1>what aristotle called the golden mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this golden mean defines to Challas </v>

55
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>character arc to Cholla grows when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>learns to avoid the simplistic solutions</v>

56
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>at the far ends of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's explore these dichotomies.</v>

57
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.283
<v Speaker 1>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a question of how to construct a </v>

58
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:16.444
<v Speaker 1>group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national identity versus racial </v>

59
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.744
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people of will conda are extremely </v>

60
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.474
<v Speaker 1>nationalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They view the world is divided into two </v>

61
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will competence and everybody else.</v>

62
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>This leads to a Wakanda first attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>among many citizens.</v>

63
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>They've built walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refused refugees,</v>

64
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.773
<v Speaker 1>reject trade and offer no foreign aid </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in the name of protecting Wakanda </v>

65
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.873
<v Speaker 1>because they value the lives of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who share the same heritage and culture </v>

66
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.684
<v Speaker 1>as themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but killmonger having grown up in </v>

67
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.654
<v Speaker 1>America has developed a strong sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial identity for him because we'll </v>

68
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>condoms have the same skin color as </v>
<v Speaker 1>blacks and the rest of the world.</v>

69
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Well condoms should see themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a global black community.</v>

70
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.523
<v Speaker 1>Among the first thing he says when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes the throne is something like all </v>

71
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.214
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that look like us are suffering </v>

72
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>in his speech at the United Nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the film to Cholla rejects</v>

73
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.023
<v Speaker 1>both the Wakandans nationalism and kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>mongers ethnicity and instead accepts </v>

74
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.514
<v Speaker 1>the middle road offered by humanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He specifically states that all of </v>

75
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>humanity is one tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a surprisingly colorblind message,</v>

76
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.154
<v Speaker 1>but a welcome one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second false dichotomy is </v>

77
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>traditionalism versus progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For all its technological advancements.</v>

78
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Will conduct is an extremely traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

79
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.623
<v Speaker 1>regularly engaging in ancient rituals </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the combat for the crown or the </v>

80
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>ingesting of the heart shaped herb for </v>
<v Speaker 1>killmonger progress requires getting rid</v>

81
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.564
<v Speaker 1>of traditions such as when he destroys </v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden of heart shaped herbs and </v>

82
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>refuses to continue the ceremonial </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat with the cello.</v>

83
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>One could even say his philosophy echoes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that of Kylo Ren.</v>

84
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>The middle ground is keeping what </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions he can,</v>

85
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but rejecting what wasn't working </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

86
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.064
<v Speaker 1>what condos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation and its hostility with the </v>

87
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:11.794
<v Speaker 1>Jabari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film's final dichotomy is the </v>

88
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>aforementioned isolationism versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonialism.</v>

89
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.463
<v Speaker 1>Most Wakandans believe continuing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries old tradition of isolationism </v>

90
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>to be the most prudent path to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining peace,</v>

91
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>including initially to Cholla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killmonger on the other hand,</v>

92
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>subscribes to a theory mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently in the film that the world is</v>

93
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:31.504
<v Speaker 1>getting smaller and you're either the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered or the conquerors killmonger </v>

94
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.674
<v Speaker 1>solution that will condoms should take </v>
<v Speaker 1>part in the same harmful colonialism </v>

95
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>that's afflicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black individuals.</v>

96
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:41.854
<v Speaker 1>For centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killmonger seeks to repay historic </v>

97
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.094
<v Speaker 1>injustices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tit for tat by arming oppress black </v>

98
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:48.424
<v Speaker 1>communities around the world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced weaponry and inciting race </v>

99
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.684
<v Speaker 1>riots and radical revolution killmonger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His political philosophy is reminiscent </v>

100
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:56.854
<v Speaker 1>of the French revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was fueled by fantasies of the </v>

101
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exacting revenge upon their oppressors.</v>

102
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Killmonger is desire for vengeance is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>impassioned,</v>

103
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.074
<v Speaker 1>but he seems to give no thought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>governing after destroying Western </v>

104
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:10.094
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like his construction of color and </v>

105
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.854
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This too is a result of his American </v>

106
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:15.704
<v Speaker 1>upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killmonger story is like that of many </v>

107
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.813
<v Speaker 1>African Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whom military service was the only </v>

108
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:21.794
<v Speaker 1>viable path out of poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was the American military which </v>

109
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.454
<v Speaker 1>trained him in the art of regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change his time in the special forces </v>

110
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>having been spent overseeing various </v>
<v Speaker 1>coups and conquests in the Middle East.</v>

111
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.313
<v Speaker 1>Not only does this result in him being </v>
<v Speaker 1>more interested in revolution than </v>

112
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>actual rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also darkly ironic.</v>

113
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.783
<v Speaker 1>He wants to colonize the so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonizers because that's what the </v>

114
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:44.954
<v Speaker 1>colonizers taught him to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of what makes killmonger </v>

115
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>such a sympathetic villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

116
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>he is a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the Challah,</v>

117
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.473
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't look for the golden mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an extremist in both his beliefs </v>

118
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.123
<v Speaker 1>and violent methodologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this extremism is painted as a </v>

119
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>direct result of Western society </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling with it's messy.</v>

120
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Past killmonger is a dark reflection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sins of our forefathers justice.</v>

121
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 1>He blamed for the actions of his father </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Chaka.</v>

122
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>He blames everyone else for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors actions as well,</v>

123
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but to Cholla rejects this when he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them [inaudible],</v>

124
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that he is not responsible for past what</v>
<v Speaker 1>condon,</v>

125
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.153
<v Speaker 1>kings mistreatment of the Jabari people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and while to Cholla doesn't deny the </v>

126
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:26.264
<v Speaker 1>wrongdoings of westerners past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He acts without animosity toward their </v>

127
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a descendants.</v>

128
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.453
<v Speaker 1>It's this optimism which allows to </v>
<v Speaker 1>challah to chart a course between the </v>

129
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:39.251
<v Speaker 1>extremes of isolationism and conquest by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the films and to Challah is persuaded by</v>

130
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.364
<v Speaker 1>killmonger that there is a need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wakanda to provide global aid and </v>

131
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>assistance just without the violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquest.</v>

132
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.143
<v Speaker 1>The movie closes with the Child Building</v>
<v Speaker 1>and outreach center in Oakland to help </v>

133
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>the people that kill monger was fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

134
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>and that's what makes killmonger is such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phenomenal villain.</v>

135
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Whereas most bad guys represent a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>

136
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.203
<v Speaker 1>evil that must be unilaterally defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killmonger is disposition is one that </v>

137
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:04.094
<v Speaker 1>must be adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killmonger doesn't just challenge our </v>

138
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:07.094
<v Speaker 1>protagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he guides them and provides them with </v>

139
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:09.584
<v Speaker 1>the insight team needs to become a truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>great king in the face of very divisive </v>

140
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:14.984
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The child is able to synthesize these </v>

141
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 1>solutions in a way that works best for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wakanda and the world.</v>

142
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like Afro Futuristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagle.</v>
