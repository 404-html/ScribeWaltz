3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.693
<v Speaker 1>Hey wise crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared here with our third and final </v>

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>exploration of Christopher Nolan's weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild mind.</v>

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.713
<v Speaker 1>And our first installment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we examined Nolan's idea of the self </v>

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>charting the relationships between our </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective perceptions and the notion of</v>

7
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

8
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>our investigation's still came too late </v>
<v Speaker 1>to save poor teddy.</v>

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.473
<v Speaker 1>In the second installment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use no one's dark knight trilogy to </v>

10
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:33.384
<v Speaker 1>discuss the fragile dynamics of society </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ways in which social norms are </v>

11
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>tested and upended by symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by desire,</v>

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and all too often by hoking Weirdos in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>

13
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.863
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.863
<v Speaker 1>And now in our third act will attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find some catharsis by looking to the </v>

15
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>universe per response to the fragile </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of humanity.</v>

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.763
<v Speaker 1>I want to know where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strap in because this is the final </v>

17
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>installment of the philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan.</v>

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll be answering your questions </v>

19
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>for the first hour in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you there.</v>

20
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.643
<v Speaker 1>And of course spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas no one's previous works focused </v>

21
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>on the inevitable conflict inherent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities.</v>

22
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Rational nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar attempts to transcend these</v>

23
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:16.574
<v Speaker 1>burdens by looking to the broad expanses</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe and hopes of ridding us </v>

24
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:20.714
<v Speaker 1>from the social and physical restraints </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored in videos one and two of this </v>

25
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:24.704
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By merging a sense of wide eyed wonder </v>

26
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>with the thrilling advancements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

27
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.443
<v Speaker 1>Nolan Helps Cooper and us break free of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectations leveled against the </v>

28
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>self and society from as early as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening scenes.</v>

29
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Interstellar situates his protagonists </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooper as an ambitious innovator,</v>

30
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>but also as a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd advocate for science and reason with</v>

31
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.023
<v Speaker 1>facts and present your conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also a guy with a pretty healthy </v>

32
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>skepticism of power and authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old federal textbook.</v>

33
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>We've replaced them with the corrected </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions,</v>

34
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.263
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before the films adventure is done </v>

35
00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:58.634
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper will have to reconcile his data </v>

36
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>driven beliefs with the mind expanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictability of the great beyond.</v>

37
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Although cooper is firmly committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own sense of practicality,</v>

38
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.083
<v Speaker 1>is eventually forced to navigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid boundary between the real and the </v>

39
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.123
<v Speaker 1>Iran deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The latter of which is a concept </v>

40
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>introduced by American philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nelson Goodman,</v>

41
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>but what is the aerial exactly in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

42
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>The ways of rope making good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored the notion of alternative world</v>

43
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 1>versions at its most basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.913
<v Speaker 1>This concept allowed for everything from</v>
<v Speaker 1>art to mathematics to be perceived and </v>

45
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 1>understood in a variety of ways.</v>

46
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this piece of art for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>and you might see a woman's face or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goblet.</v>

48
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Both interpretations here are correct in</v>
<v Speaker 1>total,</v>

49
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.593
<v Speaker 1>but only one interpretation is correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>through one particular context at a </v>

50
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:45.674
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this in essence is the art of the </v>

51
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.053
<v Speaker 1>realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are multiple ways to look at the </v>

52
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>world and no one method is better in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every instance.</v>

53
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.363
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the film's mysterious beings </v>

54
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:58.004
<v Speaker 1>experienced the universe opens up a for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a new way to experience and know the </v>

55
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.704
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not in the way we're used to with </v>

56
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is a thing that passes in space.</v>

57
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Cooper is confronted with the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing abides by his conventional ideas</v>

58
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:13.234
<v Speaker 1>of time or even cause and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper as a man of science has some </v>

59
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>difficulty adjusting to a new normal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that difficult adjustment,</v>

60
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>no one is openly able to question me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physical,</v>

61
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>spatial and chronological laws that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cooper,</v>

62
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.053
<v Speaker 1>how long the leave to be absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout much of interstellar hyman </v>

63
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.344
<v Speaker 1>space do not interact with us in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we might traditionally expect and </v>

64
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:36.694
<v Speaker 1>neither as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does all American hero Matt Damon on a </v>

65
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>new plane of existence in which even </v>
<v Speaker 1>time can be warped</v>

66
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 3>gravity on that planet will slow our </v>
<v Speaker 3>clock compared to Earth's drastically.</v>

67
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Every hour we spend on that planet will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be seven years back on her.</v>

68
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.800
<v Speaker 1>What asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan is left to ground us humans.</v>

69
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.260
<v Speaker 1>What lighthouse is there to help us </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate,</v>

70
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>to give us purpose and direction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully,</v>

71
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>interstellar not only poses this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

72
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.313
<v Speaker 1>it provides an answer and that answer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one place technology cannot touch </v>

73
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.953
<v Speaker 1>human emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the characters of interstellar </v>

74
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>frequently doubt what is real and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is trustworthy there snot filled,</v>

75
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.124
<v Speaker 1>tear drench deeply emotional experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide them with the ballast focus and </v>

76
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:21.684
<v Speaker 1>resolve to see their adventure through </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the end and those components of </v>

77
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>humanity or the very sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science alone can't provide.</v>

78
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the beginning of the film,</v>

79
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it's suggested the crash landing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stalled Cooper's aviation career was the</v>

80
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 1>result of his reliance on technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

81
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 3>We should ease Andrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see him case.</v>

82
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.830
<v Speaker 3>The only time I ever went down in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine was easy and at the wrong time.</v>

83
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.113
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's human connection and emotion and </v>

84
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>capsulated in doctor brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love for Dr Edmonds.</v>

85
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Love is the one thing we're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceiving that transcends dimensions of</v>

86
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 3>time and space</v>

87
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that leads this crew to the habitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet they so desperately seek.</v>

88
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.613
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not to say the film is </v>

89
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>anti-science far from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

90
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>it demonstrates something more complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>that science is necessary,</v>

91
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but by itself is an insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition for a journey of discovery.</v>

92
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Science alone can't solve our problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>of limited resources,</v>

93
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or societal violence.</v>

94
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>In interstellar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science needs something more.</v>

95
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It needs emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs love to fuel and guided.</v>

96
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>It requires human subjectivities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>launches us beyond facts and figures and</v>

97
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:30.814
<v Speaker 1>shiny chrome.</v>

98
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 3>They have access to infinite time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

99
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.234
<v Speaker 3>but they're not bound by anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can find a specific place in time </v>

100
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 3>we can communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm,</v>

101
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

102
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.763
<v Speaker 1>and in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar represents something of a </v>

103
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:45.534
<v Speaker 1>capstone in the Christopher Nolan </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in the face of the questions </v>

104
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 1>of identity that arrives from the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>and from society.</v>

105
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.523
<v Speaker 1>Interstellar responds by showing how </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific advancements merged with the </v>

106
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.454
<v Speaker 1>intangibles of the human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Provide us with the necessary thrust or </v>

107
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>new frontiers and personal liberation.</v>

108
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 4>If there's an answer here on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's back there somehow in that room.</v>

109
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology exhibited an interstellar</v>

110
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:10.414
<v Speaker 1>is not up today's world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's instead rooted in speculative </v>

111
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:14.494
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where the film itself even </v>

112
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.540
<v Speaker 1>acts as an elegant marriage of science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and imagination.</v>

113
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It shows us worlds and innovations we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen before with interstellar.</v>

114
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan confronts us with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of hyper [inaudible] cinema,</v>

115
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.503
<v Speaker 1>image driven storytelling up an imagined</v>
<v Speaker 1>future that can influence and </v>

116
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:32.344
<v Speaker 1>emotionally fuel us in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that future urges us to make the </v>

117
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.194
<v Speaker 1>Iran real real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we have to crawl to the </v>

118
00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:39.940
<v Speaker 1>uncertainties of time and space to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

119
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.600
<v Speaker 1>At least we're fueled by love along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way with interstellar,</v>

120
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 1>no one presents new worlds and realities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that push us far from the violence,</v>

121
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:50.950
<v Speaker 1>self destructive climate of the dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>knight trilogy or Memento.</v>

122
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.083
<v Speaker 1>And in these new worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one offers us an optimistic glimpse </v>

123
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:56.440
<v Speaker 1>of our own possible future.</v>

124
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.620
<v Speaker 1>So why did he follow this story with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dunkirk?</v>

125
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.483
<v Speaker 1>A film about the allied evacuation from </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody war time conflict in 1940 the </v>

126
00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:07.630
<v Speaker 1>short answer perhaps is that Dunkirk is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about our future too.</v>

127
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.070
<v Speaker 1>In both interstellar and Dunkirk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan unites his audience in celebrating</v>

128
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:12.904
<v Speaker 1>the indomitable spirit of the human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notion that man and woman is </v>

129
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:17.224
<v Speaker 1>essentially good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notion that each of us is built to </v>

130
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 1>persevere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is evidenced in much of Christopher</v>

131
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Nolan's recent work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the dark knight rises.</v>

132
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 1>When catwoman tells Batman she's bailing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and assures him she's no hero,</v>

133
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.903
<v Speaker 1>I'll open that tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm gone only to prove herself </v>

134
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:33.034
<v Speaker 1>wrong in the 11th hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how sweet interstellar furthers this </v>

135
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.024
<v Speaker 1>cheerful embrace of human decency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability by using love to push cooper </v>

136
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the end of his journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper's own indomitable spirit,</v>

137
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.153
<v Speaker 1>powerfully fueled by the love for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter proves enough to ensure his </v>

138
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:48.910
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

139
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.743
<v Speaker 1>What could be a clear example of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional potency that unflappable will </v>

140
00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>to persevere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then both the British referred to as the</v>

141
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:56.614
<v Speaker 1>dunkirk spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a term that's been used to convey </v>

142
00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>solidarity since the days of that bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle in World War II,</v>

143
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the dunkirk spirit is defined by a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of community,</v>

144
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.463
<v Speaker 1>a willingness by a group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in a bad situation to all help each </v>

145
00:08:08.591 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film invest a deep sense of communal</v>

146
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spirit best embodied in Mr.</v>

147
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Dawson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite lacking any military technology.</v>

148
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 1>This guy pilots is small boat into </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent conflict,</v>

149
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.943
<v Speaker 1>commits himself to saving the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers and emerges victorious thanks </v>

150
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:27.100
<v Speaker 1>to the sheer power of will you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tender on?</v>

151
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a job to do.</v>

152
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Mister Dawson's instrumentation is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical,</v>

153
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.583
<v Speaker 1>but internal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The step beyond interstellar and the </v>

154
00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:39.250
<v Speaker 1>purest possible connection between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self society and the spiritual unknown,</v>

155
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.800
<v Speaker 1>much like Doctor Emilia brand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interstellar,</v>

156
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawson,</v>

157
00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's resolutely piloted by love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while Mr.</v>

158
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.313
<v Speaker 1>Dawson was unable to save his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is in a sense still able to save the </v>

159
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:53.470
<v Speaker 1>conceptual image of his son with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

160
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawson rescues during dunkirk escape.</v>

161
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 5>How'd you know that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

162
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.280
<v Speaker 5>our son was running you loud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know she is,</v>

163
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That achievement might just be something</v>

164
00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:07.640
<v Speaker 1>even more noble and significant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of the indomitable human spirit.</v>

165
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Dunkirk suggests sometimes the Iran deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more real than real.</v>

166
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Not only is this scene in the choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters make,</v>

167
00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:15.434
<v Speaker 1>but in the way the film is constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dunkirk is structured in such a way as </v>

168
00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:22.010
<v Speaker 1>to reveal the purest distillation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this communal concept.</v>

169
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.140
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to tell the story in words</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want people,</v>

170
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.823
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want the theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If people telling the audience why you </v>

171
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:31.654
<v Speaker 5>should care about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to care about him just because </v>

172
00:09:33.731 --> 00:09:35.420
<v Speaker 5>of the physical situation or they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>in</v>

173
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.403
<v Speaker 1>where many of Nolan's previous films </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been criticized for being too long </v>

174
00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:39.974
<v Speaker 1>to dialogue heavy and expository dunkirk</v>
<v Speaker 1>hawks in and only 107 minutes offers </v>

175
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:45.044
<v Speaker 1>backstory for almost none of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and really doesn't have much </v>

176
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:49.550
<v Speaker 1>interest in conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

177
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.780
<v Speaker 1>no one created a sense of solidarity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the viewers and soldiers without</v>

178
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:56.570
<v Speaker 1>relying on the tools often used to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>in audiences.</v>

179
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.523
<v Speaker 1>Essentially it plunks us here with every</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet fired in with every ship </v>

180
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dunkirk aims to access the psychological</v>

181
00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:04.424
<v Speaker 1>concept of an affective empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability not just to know or to </v>

182
00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:08.444
<v Speaker 1>understand what someone is feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to feel that feeling before it </v>

183
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:13.790
<v Speaker 1>occurs in interviews about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of Dunkirk,</v>

184
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 1>no one said his ambition was to create </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality without the headset.</v>

185
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.613
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fully an effective experience for the </v>

186
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:21.434
<v Speaker 1>viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether Nolan's successfully reached </v>

187
00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:25.340
<v Speaker 1>this goal is up to each individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer to decide,</v>

188
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but the blending of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

189
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:28.304
<v Speaker 1>and imagination to create an immersive </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of participation in the dunkirk </v>

190
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:31.760
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>

191
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might just be Nolan's loudest call </v>

192
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:38.330
<v Speaker 1>to each of us to bind together in </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaping and perfecting the self,</v>

193
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and future that we want.</v>

194
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.683
<v Speaker 1>No one's most recent film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't just bring him a boatload of </v>

195
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:44.474
<v Speaker 1>Oscar nominations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also brought together the threads of </v>

196
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:47.384
<v Speaker 1>his earlier work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately illustrating the power of </v>

197
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:50.264
<v Speaker 1>love and the human spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan is one of the most </v>

198
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.503
<v Speaker 1>interesting filmmakers working today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His movies aren't only visceral and </v>

199
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:58.970
<v Speaker 1>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also extremely thoughtful,</v>

200
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.560
<v Speaker 1>a rare blend in today's Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is merely our interpretation of his</v>

201
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:05.690
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as with any mastercraftsman,</v>

202
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>his work will continue to inspire new </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought for years to come.</v>
