00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Hey wise cracks jared again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone else.</v>

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I just need to laugh the pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Often the crushing anxiety of existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>may feel like too much,</v>

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I have a dog.</v>

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are wise crack,</v>

6
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>love us a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Python,</v>

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.163
<v Speaker 1>these wildly bridge redefined comedy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1970s and are still hugely </v>

8
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>influential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at comedies today,</v>

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>South Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick and morty or even deadpool,</v>

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.033
<v Speaker 1>all hilarious in their own unique ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without Monte python they probably </v>

11
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monte Python paved the way for comedy as</v>

12
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.044
<v Speaker 1>we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Combining absurdity satire and Post </v>

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.183
<v Speaker 1>Warner reflexivity and the some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most influential and quoted comedies </v>

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.733
<v Speaker 1>ever an x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because there's nothing funnier than </v>

15
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:49.554
<v Speaker 1>explaining a joke to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome in his wise crack condition on </v>

16
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>the legacy of Monte Python.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

17
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>and we'll be answering your questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first hour and the comments.</v>

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.131
<v Speaker 1>Soap Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

19
00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:57.964
<v Speaker 1>they're part one postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hipster and a gluten free juice </v>

20
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Postmodernism is everywhere these days.</v>

21
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Jurassic World Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family guy.</v>

22
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.613
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much anything you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These films and TV shows constantly </v>

23
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:11.454
<v Speaker 1>refer back to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commenting on the narrative conventions </v>

24
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>and iconography of their predecessors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another desktop.</v>

25
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I wish that were the case major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the death star and this is star</v>

26
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>killer base or well just copying them </v>
<v Speaker 1>wholesale,</v>

27
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but nothing encapsulates this movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than deadpool.</v>

28
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.183
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we even did an entire philosophy of on </v>

29
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:34.464
<v Speaker 1>this exact subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone loves deadpool because quite </v>

30
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>simply he doesn't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's rebelliously self-aware,</v>

31
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly winking at his own narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mocking the superhero genre.</v>

32
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pro con this superhero thing.</v>

33
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.423
<v Speaker 1>This constant self reflexivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates postmodernism first coined </v>

34
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>by the French philosopher John Francois </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leotard in 1979 for Leotard.</v>

35
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>All stories previously told fit into </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

36
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:02.664
<v Speaker 1>told grand mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great heroes on a voyage for some </v>

37
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>grandiose goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as he referred to them metanarratives</v>

38
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.193
<v Speaker 1>her leotard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These metanarratives were stories that </v>

39
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>provided a pattern and structure for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's beliefs.</v>

40
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.893
<v Speaker 1>Teaching viewers a universal insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of the wizard of Oz and how when </v>

41
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you strip it of all the flying monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 1>and melting witches,</v>

42
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it's actually just a story about a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing that</v>

43
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 2>there's no place like,</v>

44
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>or even the fast and the furious </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath all the ludicrous car stunts.</v>

45
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.703
<v Speaker 1>There's a deeper meta-narrative about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of family through these </v>

46
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morals and social customs are taught and</v>

47
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:39.154
<v Speaker 1>reinforced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but postmodernism subverts these grand </v>

48
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>narratives revealing the chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder beneath,</v>

49
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.363
<v Speaker 1>like say Deadpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic book character who constantly </v>

50
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.260
<v Speaker 1>tears down everything that comic book </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for.</v>

51
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.283
<v Speaker 2>You're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boyfriend said this was a superhero </v>

52
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:54.434
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that guy in the red suit just turn </v>

53
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 2>that other guy into a Kebab.</v>

54
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.173
<v Speaker 1>But as edgy as deadpool may seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ain't got shit on the pythons who </v>

55
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>took postmodern deconstruction to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole other level.</v>

56
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Case in point there all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic Monty Python and the holy grail.</v>

57
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Whereas deadpool lampoons only the comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>book meta-narrative Monty Python and the</v>

58
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.394
<v Speaker 1>holy grail is defined by breaking down </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple Meta narratives among them are </v>

59
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>30 and chivalry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity logic,</v>

60
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.013
<v Speaker 1>and the very medium of film itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first of these metanarratives are </v>

61
00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:28.010
<v Speaker 1>three in chivalry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

62
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:28.844
<v Speaker 1>from the late Middle Ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idealizing nights as honorable and self </v>

63
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the usual nightlys like protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

65
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>showing mercy to enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never lying and championing truth,</v>

66
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:40.864
<v Speaker 1>injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but monty python and the holy grail </v>

67
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>completely dismantles and mocks these </v>
<v Speaker 1>time tested tenant.</v>

68
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.393
<v Speaker 3>Who's that</v>

69
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.773
<v Speaker 1>when Sir Robin and counters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a three headed giant is minstrel sing </v>

70
00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the heroic narrative that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>expects.</v>

71
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 3>He was not afraid to die,</v>

72
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but Robin himself runs the hell away as </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly as possible.</v>

73
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

74
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.563
<v Speaker 3>All good.</v>

75
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.443
<v Speaker 1>Similarly in the Arthurian legend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur's arrival at camelot is usually </v>

76
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>treated as an emotional high point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his story,</v>

77
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.550
<v Speaker 1>comma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tamil.</v>

78
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yet monty python undercuts the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriousness of the moment,</v>

79
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.660
<v Speaker 1>turning this hallmark event into a goofy</v>
<v Speaker 1>musical number and then to top it off,</v>

80
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Arthur decides not to even bother going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to camelot.</v>

81
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sick and bolts.</v>

82
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Let's not go to camelot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a silly place.</v>

83
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.953
<v Speaker 1>Each of our supposed great heroes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>revealed to be far less than they claim </v>

84
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.633
<v Speaker 1>the power hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur demands that every peasant </v>

85
00:04:58.471 --> 00:04:59.820
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge him as their king.</v>

86
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.053
<v Speaker 4>No king,</v>

87
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but if they dare question his rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he immediately attacks them.</v>

88
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm being repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

89
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 4>want to give it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why'd you have that Julia?</v>

90
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm on about sir.</v>

91
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Galahad the pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most faithful of nights is to deuced</v>

92
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>in less than four minutes by a company </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 160 lonely women.</v>

93
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.110
<v Speaker 1>And when Lancelot received a note from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distressed maiden,</v>

94
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.820
<v Speaker 1>he rushes to rescue her in the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>birders dozens of unarmed people.</v>

95
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.983
<v Speaker 1>Then in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out there wasn't even a maiden </v>

96
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:36.414
<v Speaker 1>to save in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I hopping on just find that </v>

97
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.553
<v Speaker 1>monty python users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism to illustrate how the </v>

98
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.314
<v Speaker 1>stories people tell themselves enables </v>
<v Speaker 1>some awful Lancelot and Arthur's own </v>

99
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:50.100
<v Speaker 1>metanarratives justifying their violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and oppressive acts.</v>

100
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.083
<v Speaker 1>The fact that these men and narratives </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't even true to begin with is just </v>

101
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.550
<v Speaker 1>the icing on the cake as our nightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes are revealed to be cowards,</v>

102
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>hypocrites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violence.</v>

103
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Sociopaths.</v>

104
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Can you see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just get carried away.</v>

105
00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:02.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

106
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.840
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

107
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.673
<v Speaker 1>Even God has put into doubt per the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity meta-narrative God is good </v>

108
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:11.010
<v Speaker 1>and all powerful and has a plan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

109
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Yet in monty python and the holy grail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God isn't great.</v>

110
00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:15.684
<v Speaker 1>Then kind at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a cranky Dick who's really </v>

111
00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:18.954
<v Speaker 1>crappily animated philosopher Mikael </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxton define this as the downward </v>

112
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.424
<v Speaker 1>swing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I swear isn't a baseball term per </v>

113
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.733
<v Speaker 1>boxton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most stories are upward swings and that </v>

114
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>they elevate a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toy,</v>

115
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.390
<v Speaker 1>symbolic state and make them universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>

116
00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:37.080
<v Speaker 1>in a downward swing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classical story becomes so distorted</v>

117
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:39.750
<v Speaker 1>and grotesque that you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether to scream,</v>

118
00:06:39.751 --> 00:06:40.740
<v Speaker 1>cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or laugh,</v>

119
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just the story that becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted,</v>

120
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.650
<v Speaker 1>but also we the readers and viewers </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

121
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Every lesson we learned through the Meta</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative is now cast into doubt.</v>

122
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.593
<v Speaker 1>Right alongside it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take one of the most famous scenes in </v>

123
00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:55.500
<v Speaker 1>the holy Grail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the witch trial,</v>

124
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.513
<v Speaker 1>Sir Avir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ys puts a poor woman through a </v>

125
00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:01.770
<v Speaker 1>foolproof logic test in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine if she's a witch,</v>

126
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>her bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beer which is burned at the stake,</v>

127
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.050
<v Speaker 1>just like wood and wood floats on water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a duck.</v>

128
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.050
<v Speaker 1>So if the woman is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he will weigh the same as a duck,</v>

129
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Monte Python here takes formal logic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted it into a grotesque version of</v>

130
00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:15.234
<v Speaker 1>itself in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>casting doubt on our own fundamental </v>

131
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:20.550
<v Speaker 1>faith in logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If classical logic can be distorted into</v>

132
00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>justifying a woman's death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how can it be truly trusted at all?</v>

133
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.780
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the Holy Grail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this distortion extends to the very film</v>

134
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:28.614
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Arthur prepares for an epic battle </v>

135
00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:31.164
<v Speaker 1>with the French at castle ard Modern Day</v>
<v Speaker 1>police suddenly arrive in arrest of the </v>

136
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:34.974
<v Speaker 1>king for murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beliefs then push and cover the </v>

137
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:38.430
<v Speaker 1>camera Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking the fourth wall,</v>

138
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.430
<v Speaker 1>making the audience cognitive to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact they're watching a movie.</v>

139
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.030
<v Speaker 1>The holy grail constantly pokes fun at </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself for being a movie.</v>

140
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.133
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film's title credits or undermined </v>

141
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:48.204
<v Speaker 1>when Swedish subtitles suddenly appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting the country as a terrific </v>

142
00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:52.320
<v Speaker 1>vacation spot.</v>

143
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.870
<v Speaker 1>The credit makers are then promptly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired,</v>

144
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.470
<v Speaker 1>causing the credit format to completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>change throughout the film.</v>

145
00:07:58.471 --> 00:07:59.304
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Hughes's coconuts instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight course due to the films tight </v>

146
00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:02.784
<v Speaker 1>budget and later Arthur even refers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one character as we'll see in 2012 and </v>

147
00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:08.730
<v Speaker 1>just the hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point home,</v>

148
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.520
<v Speaker 1>the night's defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legendary black beast of art,</v>

149
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.990
<v Speaker 1>not through any battle or test of wills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the anime or that design the</v>

150
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:16.824
<v Speaker 1>creature as a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This self reflexivity reveals the holy </v>

151
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:24.330
<v Speaker 1>grail to be its own metanarrative film </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as artificial as the chivalrous are</v>

152
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:25.530
<v Speaker 1>30 in heroes with him.</v>

153
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>

154
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.913
<v Speaker 6>You Go.</v>

155
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.263
<v Speaker 1>That's just how postmodern monty python </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the holy grail truly is it </v>

156
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>deconstructs religion and logic within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstruction of heroic tropes within a</v>

157
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 1>deconstruction of the film medium </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

158
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Basically the inception of postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>phil part to the comedy of the absurd.</v>

159
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 1>There's probably no show is popular on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interwebs as rick and morty.</v>

160
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisecracks really just the domain switch</v>

161
00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:58.944
<v Speaker 1>away from becoming a rick and morty fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>club and that's because the show always </v>

162
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absurd.</v>

163
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Humor with thought provoking insights </v>
<v Speaker 1>like well on the meaninglessness of life</v>

164
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.403
<v Speaker 1>as a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the get the episode when massive </v>

165
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 1>heads suddenly appear all across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

166
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>many people begin to worship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head says God starting up a cult and</v>

167
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>even sacrificing people to appease them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

168
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these heads aren't gods at all,</v>

169
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.893
<v Speaker 1>but an alien race that just wants Earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>to participate in an American idol like </v>

170
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.124
<v Speaker 1>reality show.</v>

171
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>This type of humor is known as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy of the absurd.</v>

172
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>This existential base comedy focuses on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fallout when confronted with a world</v>

173
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>devoid of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

174
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>instead of wallowing in some murky woe </v>
<v Speaker 1>is me despair.</v>

175
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 1>The absurd takes the opposite approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing out the broad humor and our own</v>

176
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:46.824
<v Speaker 1>tragic insignificance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These tragic absurdity is foundational </v>

177
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 1>to Monty Python's brand of humor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their third feature of the life of Brian</v>

178
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.863
<v Speaker 1>Poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian's entire existence is one big </v>

179
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:57.714
<v Speaker 1>absurd misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The humble peasant is born in the </v>

180
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next to Jesus,</v>

181
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>confusing the three wiseman who assumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten,</v>

182
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.700
<v Speaker 1>not special at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

183
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 1>to be the messiah.</v>

184
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.100
<v Speaker 7>Here's the son of God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>King of the Jews,</v>

185
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 7>Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is it?</v>

186
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.283
<v Speaker 1>The projection of significance on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>insignificant is a hallmark of </v>

187
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>existential thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I particular our boy Albert Kamoo,</v>

188
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.890
<v Speaker 1>who rejected this desperate search for </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and instead embraced the guest.</v>

189
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It absurd when Brian runs away from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciples,</v>

190
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 1>they mistakenly believe he's risen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven,</v>

191
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 1>and later when Brian loses a sandal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these same disciples per claim,</v>

192
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>the Sandal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his side.</v>

193
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian didn't mean for the same old to be</v>

194
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.334
<v Speaker 1>anything more than footwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet people in their desire for </v>

195
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>meaning attribute significance to even </v>
<v Speaker 1>the silliest of objects.</v>

196
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.573
<v Speaker 7>Will</v>

197
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.943
<v Speaker 1>we see this exact same misappropriation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning and get swifty as principal </v>

198
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.333
<v Speaker 1>vagina and the rest of his colts mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alien heads as gods when actually </v>

199
00:10:58.721 --> 00:10:59.554
<v Speaker 1>they're only reality TV show junkies </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedies of the absurd draw their humor </v>

200
00:11:03.191 --> 00:11:04.024
<v Speaker 1>from this discrepancy between what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what isn't between what's true and </v>

201
00:11:07.361 --> 00:11:08.194
<v Speaker 1>what people believe to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters in these absurd comedies are </v>

202
00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:11.824
<v Speaker 1>often caught in hopeless situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced into repetitive and ultimately </v>

203
00:11:15.161 --> 00:11:15.994
<v Speaker 1>fruitless actions like Brian who </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly tries to tell his disciples </v>

204
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.060
<v Speaker 1>he's not the Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too little avail.</v>

205
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:26.643
<v Speaker 1>No matter what Brian does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his disciples grow in number and become </v>

206
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.423
<v Speaker 1>ever more fervent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all leading to a horrific and tragic </v>

207
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:35.050
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crucifixion,</v>

208
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.420
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite his impending doom,</v>

209
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.403
<v Speaker 1>Brian's comforted by his fellow </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucifixion buddies who break out into </v>

210
00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:42.290
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>

211
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 8>go wines.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look on the Bra,</v>

212
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.673
<v Speaker 1>the Crucifixion Buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheerful lament reflects the myth of in </v>

213
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 1>which poor sisyphus is Kirsch to roll a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock up a mountain,</v>

214
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>only for it to fall back down over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

215
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Camou famously applied the Greek men to </v>
<v Speaker 1>life itself.</v>

216
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.893
<v Speaker 1>The trick though is not to let this </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaninglessness ever gets you down </v>

217
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the words of life of Brian,</v>

218
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.173
<v Speaker 1>always look at the bright side because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when faced with our own insignificance </v>

219
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and impending doom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one real option.</v>

220
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Though it may seem completely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laughter,</v>

221
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 1>part three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political satire.</v>

222
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satire has become more vital than ever,</v>

223
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.073
<v Speaker 1>whether via late night talk shows like </v>
<v Speaker 1>full frontal with Samantha Bee or more </v>

224
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>traditional half hour comedies like </v>
<v Speaker 1>southpark hell.</v>

225
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 1>The last three seasons of Southpark </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused heavily on the 2016 election and</v>

226
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>the trump presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give two shits about a treaty.</v>

227
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.454
<v Speaker 1>You're a Polish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>midget political satires like southpark </v>

228
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.303
<v Speaker 1>derive their humor by revealing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy in established rules and </v>

229
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>orders.</v>

230
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Allow the 2016 election and the PC </v>
<v Speaker 1>brigade,</v>

231
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>but way before South Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monte Python paved the way,</v>

232
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 1>subverting the established political </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies of England.</v>

233
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southpark creators,</v>

234
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:57.244
<v Speaker 1>Trey Parker and Matt Stone often cite </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monte Python as the single biggest </v>

235
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.233
<v Speaker 1>influence on their show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and I met and got along so well </v>

236
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:04.684
<v Speaker 1>because we were just pure python freaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Monte Python's final and darkest </v>

237
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>feature the meaning of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pythons openly comment on English,</v>

238
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 1>imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic disparity,</v>

239
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>and the classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchies of the country.</v>

240
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.823
<v Speaker 1>The opening mini movie be Crimson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Permanent Assurance depicts a group of </v>

241
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:21.694
<v Speaker 1>poor elderly workers forced into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pirate like frenzy by young American </v>

242
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.074
<v Speaker 1>yuppies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old workers rebelled against these </v>

243
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Yuppie Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing them out windows to their death</v>

244
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>and then proceed to destroy every shiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright corporate building in their path,</v>

245
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.570
<v Speaker 1>bringing down the system that literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>anchored them to the ground.</v>

246
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 1>The pythons carry the city miracle.</v>

247
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.653
<v Speaker 1>Look at capitalism throughout the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning the economic notion that </v>

248
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>self-interest results in the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

249
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see quite the opposite in the sketch,</v>

250
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:48.904
<v Speaker 1>the miracle of birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctors are far more concerned with </v>

251
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:51.934
<v Speaker 1>their fancy equipment and impressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their administrator than the poor woman </v>

252
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:55.564
<v Speaker 1>they're operating on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the most expensive machines in </v>

253
00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>case the administrator comes later in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sketch.</v>

254
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:00.574
<v Speaker 1>Live organ transplants to bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately remove the liver from an </v>

255
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 1>impoverished man for the good of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

256
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 1>remarking nonsensically that they must </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the guy that they can then take his</v>

257
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:10.774
<v Speaker 1>liver.</v>

258
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Met Him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He constantly,</v>

259
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>we see people drowning under this </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

260
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Britain's Yorkshire is ironically </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as a third world country and</v>

261
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:23.074
<v Speaker 1>in the same sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poor man is forced to sell off his </v>

262
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>children to science in order to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends meet this economic disparity.</v>

263
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:30.154
<v Speaker 1>Climaxes in the sketch the autumn years </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the grotesquely obese and rich Mr </v>

264
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.523
<v Speaker 1>Creosote dines at a fancy restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating more and more until he literally </v>

265
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The implications couldn't be clear.</v>

266
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>The rich get richer and fatter at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expense of the starving lower class,</v>

267
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just social injustice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the python,</v>

268
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but the whole notion of British </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperialism in general,</v>

269
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.453
<v Speaker 1>the hand of God strikes down a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer who insists Britain will always </v>

270
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 1>need an army to put down differing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and in the same sketch,</v>

271
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 1>a sergeant major drills his platoon on </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they have anything better to do.</v>

272
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Then march up and down the town square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:09.644
<v Speaker 1>it turns out they do.</v>

274
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be quite honest.</v>

275
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:16.201
<v Speaker 4>Sij I'd rather be at home with the wife </v>
<v Speaker 4>and kids now.</v>

276
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.453
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taj,</v>

277
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.410
<v Speaker 4>right off you go</v>

278
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.210
<v Speaker 1>like read a book or go to the movies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>really anything at all.</v>

279
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.480
<v Speaker 1>The pythons even state this central </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis at the end of the picture.</v>

280
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to be nice to people to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating fat.</v>

281
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.183
<v Speaker 4>Read a good book every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get some walking in and try and live </v>

282
00:15:32.621 --> 00:15:34.960
<v Speaker 4>together in peace and harmony with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people of all creeds and nations.</v>

283
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.863
<v Speaker 1>For the pythons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>British imperialism is a threat to the </v>

284
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This manifests in their depiction of war</v>

285
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>where soldiers attempting to celebrate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday our gun down one by one,</v>

286
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.283
<v Speaker 1>the brutal reality of war of supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperial conquests juxtaposed against </v>

287
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>the simple pleasure of enjoying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday cake.</v>

288
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 1>These ideas extended their sketch show </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flying circus.</v>

289
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.713
<v Speaker 1>The show often portrays bureaucrats is </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffoons or as sticks in the mud </v>

290
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 1>constantly censoring the show itself.</v>

291
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 7>Pet was to my nine of inquiry feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's getting to city.</v>

292
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.310
<v Speaker 7>It's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's silly,</v>

293
00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:09.760
<v Speaker 7>it's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

294
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 7>Get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Get on with this.</v>

295
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>For hitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one set,</v>

296
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.213
<v Speaker 1>the essential founding gag of monty </v>
<v Speaker 1>python is the bubbling magma of </v>

297
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>absurdity that lay beneath the fragile </v>
<v Speaker 1>crust of British reserve.</v>

298
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.133
<v Speaker 1>At any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man with a bowler hat or an umbrella </v>

299
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 1>might become a raging crossdresser or </v>
<v Speaker 1>barking savers.</v>

300
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It's this unpredictability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mixture between the postmodern,</v>

301
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.363
<v Speaker 1>the political and the absurd that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monte Python unlike any comedy troop </v>

302
00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>that came before or after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By merging together social commentary,</v>

303
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 1>existential angst and just plain old </v>
<v Speaker 1>silliness.</v>

304
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 1>The pythons always keep you on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>toes.</v>

305
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.970
<v Speaker 1>They defied convention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concocting a brand of comedy,</v>

306
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:54.971
<v Speaker 1>so singular that a word has been created</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for that pythonesque today.</v>

307
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Their brand of humor permeates every </v>
<v Speaker 1>facet of the comedic landscape.</v>

308
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 1>As always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching guys.</v>
