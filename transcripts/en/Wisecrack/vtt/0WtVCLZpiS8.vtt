1
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>if we're entering a new golden age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>space exploration,</v>

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>what is the main bottleneck that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>face?</v>

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>The main bottleneck has to do with life </v>
<v Speaker 1>support and the human.</v>

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already said robots.</v>

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already said objects the size of a</v>

7
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>bus to the planet Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we're talking about humans which</v>

8
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:30.054
<v Speaker 1>require an whole support network and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to realize that things that we </v>

9
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:34.944
<v Speaker 1>don't even consider it all with robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>become central and a bottleneck for </v>

10
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:41.004
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans have to live in an environment </v>

11
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>where there's radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this loneliness,</v>

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>where the journey could take two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where temperatures are below freezing,</v>

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>where the atmosphere of pressure is only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent.</v>

14
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>The atmospheric pressure on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and eventually we want to create a</v>

15
00:00:58.501 --> 00:00:59.334
<v Speaker 1>base there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to go there just to </v>

16
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>plant the fly and come back and crow </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want a self sustaining a plant,</v>

18
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>a base on Mars that could support </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

19
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>This means it has to be done in several </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>The first step would be to create a base</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Mars with power solar power.</v>

21
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Can provide the energy and lava tubes </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground lava tubes,</v>

22
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.274
<v Speaker 1>might be able to provide caves by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>astronauts could live and create the </v>

23
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>first outpost underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it was done in the movie.</v>

24
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.094
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon base on the moon in that movie </v>

25
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:38.784
<v Speaker 1>was underground providing a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier to radiation and then once you </v>

26
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:44.724
<v Speaker 1>have the base set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to begin the process of </v>

27
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>creating a self sustaining agriculture </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

28
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to eat on Mars?</v>

29
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.273
<v Speaker 1>You can order a hamburger because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be shipped from the </v>

30
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:56.814
<v Speaker 1>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to create an agriculture and </v>

31
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>this means genetic engineering.</v>

32
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.423
<v Speaker 1>This means creating genetically modified</v>
<v Speaker 1>algae and plants that can consume the </v>

33
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:08.004
<v Speaker 1>rich carbon dioxide atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in a very cold environment and </v>

34
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.594
<v Speaker 1>thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we have to create mining </v>

35
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:15.114
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to mine the ice ice can provide </v>

36
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:19.584
<v Speaker 1>oxygen for breathing water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for drinking and hydrogen for rocket </v>

37
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.654
<v Speaker 1>fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we have to begin a mining </v>

38
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>operation so that we have the materials </v>
<v Speaker 1>to build cities,</v>

39
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>materials to build bases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen to breathe,</v>

40
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>water to drink and hydrogen for rocket </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>

41
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.033
<v Speaker 1>Then the last step in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this will take maybe another 100 </v>

42
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to send satellites,</v>

43
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.413
<v Speaker 1>satellites orbiting around Mars to begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of melting the polar </v>

44
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>icecaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called space solar power.</v>

45
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>We have the blueprints already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is cost,</v>

46
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.973
<v Speaker 1>but the costs are dropping for sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>payloads into artists space </v>

47
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>dramatically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so people are,</v>

48
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.034
<v Speaker 1>once again dusting off these old plans </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create satellites around the earth </v>

49
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.153
<v Speaker 1>satellites around Mars that can beam </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and begin the process of melting </v>

50
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the ice caps.</v>

51
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.443
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you raise the temperature of Mars </v>

52
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.904
<v Speaker 1>by about six degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the temperature of Mars rises 60 </v>

53
00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes auto catalytic.</v>

54
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>It takes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes self feeding because the more</v>

55
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:32.974
<v Speaker 1>heat you have on Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more carbon dioxide you loft into </v>

56
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which creates more greenhouse effect,</v>

57
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.583
<v Speaker 1>which allowed you to melt even more ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>to raise the temperature even more so </v>

58
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you have a positive feedback loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

59
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>can we reach six degrees?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the key point.</v>

60
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>If we can raise the surface temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Mars by six degrees,</v>

61
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.913
<v Speaker 1>we can create this artificial spiral by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it feeds on itself and we can </v>

62
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>begin the process of terraforming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars is there.</v>

63
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots don't need terraforming.</v>

64
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Humans do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so to make more suitable for humans,</v>

65
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be the big problem.</v>
