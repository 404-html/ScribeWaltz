00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>costing the taxpayers millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the big apple store,</v>

<v Speaker 1>without a warrant.</v>

40
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.513

<v Speaker 1>but takes back his suit.</v>

43
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Leaving Peter to walk home naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Asks Liz to homecoming,</v>

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.200

<v Speaker 1>scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robbing an airplane full of avengers.</v>

49
00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:58.974
<v Speaker 1>Merge tombs tries the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to drop a building on your </v>

<v Speaker 1>face trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Peter Remembers he has super </v>

51
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:04.744
<v Speaker 1>strength and thoughts is planned by </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashing the plane into an area full of </v>

52
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>tourists having utterly reckless his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

53
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Peter says goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ilan offers peter a job at tesla,</v>

54
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>but peter declines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

55
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.524
<v Speaker 1>Aunt may was in this spiderman </v>
<v Speaker 1>homecoming marries the superhero action </v>

56
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>shondra and the teen comedy genre with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>license at got online.</v>

57
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>The film is stylized like John Hughes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>

58
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.833
<v Speaker 1>both through homages to Ferris Bueller </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't go to college pretty in Pinko </v>

59
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.153
<v Speaker 1>and the one about breakfast and through </v>
<v Speaker 1>its themes of teenagers exploring </v>

60
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>romance,</v>

61
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.253
<v Speaker 1>and hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me confidence through the lens </v>

62
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:41.044
<v Speaker 1>of a kid growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film updates the Sony Spiderman </v>

63
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
<v Speaker 1>ethos with great power comes great </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and 10 more reboots.</v>

64
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Usually this is interpreted as meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that since Peter has great power,</v>

65
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>he has the obligation to use it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utmost good of society.</v>

66
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.543
<v Speaker 1>But homecoming inverts this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning whether the young Peter is </v>

67
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>responsible enough to wield great power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know anything.</v>

68
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.593
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to do?</v>

69
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.643
<v Speaker 1>I think you've done in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter is impulsive and fails to think </v>

70
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>through the consequences of his use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

71
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.723
<v Speaker 1>not so different from the criminals who </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell nuclear weapons to people without </v>

72
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:16.384
<v Speaker 1>conducting a background check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He considers using his power for </v>

73
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.851
<v Speaker 1>frivolous means such as crashing Liz's </v>
<v Speaker 1>party as Spiderman for the gram and jail</v>

74
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>breaking his suit before reading up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Windows Vista.</v>

75
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>His father figure Ilan has to repeatedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>swoop in and clean up his mess,</v>

76
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.283
<v Speaker 1>usually in a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately taking away a suit so he can </v>

77
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:35.794
<v Speaker 1>dry clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only when Peter realizes that his </v>

78
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>actions make things explode all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he grows up.</v>

79
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Ironically realizing he is not ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wield such power until the sql spiderman</v>

80
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>home depot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a note of intertextual irony,</v>

81
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:50.764
<v Speaker 1>Michael Keaton appears as an avian </v>
<v Speaker 1>villain on the heels of 2014 Oscar </v>

82
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Darling Birdman or the unexpected value </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shooting off your nose in it.</v>

83
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Keaton's character falls into obscurity </v>
<v Speaker 1>after starring in a superhero franchise,</v>

84
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>much as Keaton did after his starring </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in Batman,</v>

85
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.953
<v Speaker 1>although who could forget Jack Frost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally every human after they </v>

86
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.874
<v Speaker 1>lobotomized it from their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This role becomes an ironic completion </v>

87
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.134
<v Speaker 1>of Birdman and that the film made Keaton</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant enough to return to lucrative </v>

88
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:21.334
<v Speaker 1>franchises and play the underdog to mega</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars like Robert Downey Jr and 16 time </v>

89
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Oscar winner Zendaya for earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

90
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm Garrick's wormy Lloyd and a case you</v>
