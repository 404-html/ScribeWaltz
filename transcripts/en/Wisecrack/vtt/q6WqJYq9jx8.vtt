00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.043
<v Speaker 1>Crack Jerod here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a favorite among the wise </v>

2
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:07.224
<v Speaker 1>crack staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tale of humans picked for </v>

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.354
<v Speaker 1>experimental augmentations to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when people stop being </v>

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>polite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start getting real at first.</v>

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DSX franchise franchises,</v>

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 1>they kind of wet dream for info wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasts.</v>

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.643
<v Speaker 1>Murderous clocks by the Illuminati are </v>
<v Speaker 1>carried out by world governments while </v>

8
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>the player traverses fema camps and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovers the truth behind fake news,</v>

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.563
<v Speaker 1>but unlike certain performance artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dance sexist forays into conspiracy </v>

10
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>serve as more than just a means to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary.</v>

11
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:38.444
<v Speaker 1>So the game reveals how paranoia informs</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of societies decisions than we'd </v>

12
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>like to admit and serves as a cautionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>tale for the dangers of technology comp.</v>

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>But there are no gay frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

14
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.654
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like him putting chemicals in </v>

15
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the water that turned the frigging frogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this wise crack condition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dsx.</v>

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>This video was made in collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our buddy Joseph over at real life.</v>

18
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn more about his channel and</v>

19
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>check out his related video at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this one.</v>

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And if you're here visiting from real </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

21
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.783
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead for all the games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day sx series asks two basic </v>

23
00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

24
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.903
<v Speaker 1>what would it mean for society if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could all become cyborgs with Jack's </v>

25
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>arms and to what does the premise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every conspiracy theory is true mean for</v>

26
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:24.274
<v Speaker 1>the real world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before we get into the ethics of </v>

27
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>skull guns and neural enhancement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to put on our tinfoil hats.</v>

28
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 1>There is no shortage of conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories in the day,</v>

29
00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:33.784
<v Speaker 1>a sex series in the original game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a splinter organization of the </v>

30
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.234
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati called majestic 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a nan night virus called the </v>

31
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>gray debt as a means to consolidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their power.</v>

32
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.373
<v Speaker 1>Why contain it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it spill over into the schools and </v>

33
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>churches let the bodies pile up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets.</v>

34
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll beg us to save them as producers</v>

35
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>of the only cure for the disease as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

36
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>They can easily manipulate others while </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing off the disorder.</v>

37
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Wrought by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great death is a manmade virus.</v>

38
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Everyone up to the president is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>UNESCO's mercy,</v>

39
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 1>as long as you Naccho controls the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>

40
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:06.994
<v Speaker 1>If Ambrosia in the cul invisible war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illuminati controls two of the most </v>

41
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.283
<v Speaker 1>influential groups in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Trade Organization and the </v>

42
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>order a religious organization opposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the WTO.</v>

43
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>By managing the conflict between these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two factions,</v>

44
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>the Illuminati is better able to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

45
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new prequels,</v>

46
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>we see the illuminati attempt to limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>human augmentation.</v>

47
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Since having a bunch of engineered super</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans running around isn't really great</v>

48
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 1>for the whole compliant population thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're going for.</v>

49
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.883
<v Speaker 1>If there's one thread that has run </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the sometimes vastly different </v>

50
00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>games in the series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's paranoia.</v>

51
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Not only is there the conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoia,</v>

52
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 1>but also paranoia directed at so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsiders and others.</v>

53
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you much greater going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

54
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.503
<v Speaker 1>the Games are fueled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profound power of paranoia and that </v>

55
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter whether the paranoia </v>
<v Speaker 1>points to the truth or not.</v>

56
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.623
<v Speaker 1>Paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of truth shapes our actions </v>

57
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early on in the game.</v>

58
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Gunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sidebar,</v>

59
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.663
<v Speaker 1>coworker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who yearns for a skull gun is convinced </v>

60
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>that the facility staff is replacing </v>
<v Speaker 1>orange soda in the vending machines with</v>

61
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>lemon lime in an inane and unlikely </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy against him.</v>

62
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.720
<v Speaker 2>The machine will not make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still maintenance,</v>

63
00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:20.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows I like.</v>

64
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.063
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you think the staff has some kind of </v>

65
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 2>plot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

66
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:25.620
<v Speaker 2>to do that on purpose,</v>

67
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>except 20 years later in the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequel,</v>

68
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's revealed in the ruins of gunters </v>
<v Speaker 1>office that he was right all along,</v>

69
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.113
<v Speaker 3>denying people their natural born rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>to choose their own artificially </v>

70
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.350
<v Speaker 3>flavored destiny's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

71
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.360
<v Speaker 3>there's just something wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

72
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.093
<v Speaker 1>Probably some sort of office politics as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if to foreshadow the entire rest of the </v>

73
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:45.204
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea of just because you're </v>

74
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.574
<v Speaker 1>paranoid doesn't mean they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After you becomes the main ethos of Dsx </v>

75
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.523
<v Speaker 1>in mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divided colleague Spin Wild Tales of </v>

76
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>getting hacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which turn out to be true.</v>

77
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who bombed the train station,</v>

78
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't think they'd love to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are.</v>

79
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You need to help me figure out who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking into us and make them stop other</v>

80
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:08.344
<v Speaker 1>suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a police coverup of a bombing there </v>

81
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:12.540
<v Speaker 1>probably destroying all the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is right now.</v>

82
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Also true and I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even you,</v>

83
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>the player must navigate who to trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>your old time boss David Saraf,</v>

84
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.533
<v Speaker 1>pilot Alex Vega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your new boss that Interpol who may or </v>

85
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:27.420
<v Speaker 1>may not be working for the Illuminati at</v>
<v Speaker 1>every point.</v>

86
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.283
<v Speaker 1>The game undermined your trust in others</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you hack into the emails of your </v>

87
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:31.734
<v Speaker 1>coworkers installed listening devices </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get ambushed by enemies who were </v>

88
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:36.990
<v Speaker 1>tipped off about your arrival hell.</v>

89
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.853
<v Speaker 1>Even the suicide cult that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>merge with computers and mankind </v>

90
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>divided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn out to only be a few years off from</v>

91
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>being right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>JC Denton manages to do this with Helios</v>

92
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the original day of sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why does sex make a point to validate</v>

93
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.253
<v Speaker 1>even the most far fetched ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be in part a greater message </v>

94
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 1>about how paranoia works in the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

95
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>People who are paranoid often don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>invent things out of nothing,</v>

96
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.593
<v Speaker 1>but instead take interpretive leaps when</v>
<v Speaker 1>over analyzing the data presented to </v>

97
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:07.494
<v Speaker 1>them or if you thought he was high </v>
<v Speaker 1>strung before the attack only made him </v>

98
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>more manic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's making connections.</v>

99
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.800
<v Speaker 1>No one else sees some that may not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

100
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.753
<v Speaker 1>but rather than dismissing this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoia as mere delusion dsx runs with </v>

101
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 1>it is a man rambling in the sewers about</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind control,</v>

102
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it,</v>

103
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>the hive mind inside the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I questioned what holds us together were</v>

104
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>unequivocally yes.</v>

105
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 1>You mean your attempt to control people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amplifying your hypnotic techniques with</v>

106
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 1>some kind of social enhancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This brings me to one of mankind.</v>

107
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Divided is most important commentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tracing the relationship between general</v>

108
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.304
<v Speaker 1>paranoia and racial paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Augmented humans as a metaphor for </v>

109
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:51.774
<v Speaker 1>racial discrimination isn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle as a mechanically augmented </v>

110
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.543
<v Speaker 1>Interpol agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You face harassments from the citizens </v>

111
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>of Prague and literally live on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong side of the tracks.</v>

112
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.793
<v Speaker 1>As you witnessed routine police </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutality inflicted on your augmented </v>

113
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.724
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what fuels this </v>

114
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:10.214
<v Speaker 1>discrimination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're turning to cigar enthusiast and </v>

115
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:12.884
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least with these liberty and </v>

116
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Dumbledore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writes about him and forced flyboys.</v>

117
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.153
<v Speaker 1>Jack are paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theories often reflect our own </v>

118
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 1>identities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and shortcomings rather than </v>

119
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>the actual state of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

120
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>he cites a story from Lacan regarding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealous husband who even ever right that</v>

121
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>his wife is sleeping around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still pathologically jealous.</v>

122
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.623
<v Speaker 1>If she stays late at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll pathologically assume she's being </v>

123
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>unfaithful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she starts having male friends.</v>

124
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Same thing as a development of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>logic.</v>

125
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Gisha excites Nazi antisemitism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a Jewish person committed a crime,</v>

126
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.273
<v Speaker 1>it could very well be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fixation on Jewish crime spoke </v>

127
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:53.444
<v Speaker 1>more to German paranoia about foreigners</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pure blood then to any kind of real </v>

128
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.490
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

129
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>crime is just crime until a Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>person commits it,</v>

130
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.223
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes part of the Grand Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy to ruin the German race and </v>

131
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.184
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at conspiracy theories in </v>

132
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.004
<v Speaker 1>the same light are most laws made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>closed door meetings with lobbyists and </v>

133
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.084
<v Speaker 1>interest groups probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they all part of a secret cult to </v>

134
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.470
<v Speaker 1>serve their reptilian overlords?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

135
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.753
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dsx and he augmentation advocates </v>

136
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.053
<v Speaker 1>filter all information through the Lens </v>
<v Speaker 1>that augmented people are dangerous and </v>

137
00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 1>possibly an affront to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking heads use terrorism,</v>

138
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.393
<v Speaker 1>or the catastrophic August incident </v>
<v Speaker 1>where augmented people were hacked into </v>

139
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:36.294
<v Speaker 1>going into a homicidal rage to justify </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartheid style oppression of augmented </v>

140
00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:42.990
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This discrimination then fuels even more</v>

141
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:45.330
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus making augmented paranoia,</v>

142
00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.100
<v Speaker 1>a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

143
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Everyone looking over their shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrified.</v>

144
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 4>We're going to attack them again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody probably will treat people like</v>

145
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 4>animals long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll start acting like animals.</v>

146
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 1>The power of paranoia to shape public </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse can be seen in Dsx.</v>

147
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.993
<v Speaker 1>Eliza [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense of news coverage meant to </v>

148
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:03.394
<v Speaker 1>spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear toward the augmented is just </v>

149
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.740
<v Speaker 1>reporting the news.</v>

150
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Let Ms Dot Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>News outlets are simply reporting on the</v>

151
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 2>current situation</v>

152
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and even if the reporting is true for </v>
<v Speaker 1>guest points out,</v>

153
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>you can choose to only show my shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very ugly,</v>

154
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.803
<v Speaker 2>but that is only a small part of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>News outlets only care about a small </v>

155
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry Ms Dot Dossen,</v>

156
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>but you can't trust the news outlets if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to understand the world.</v>

157
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.820
<v Speaker 1>The Org debate in the news functions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>two levels,</v>

158
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.953
<v Speaker 1>one as aquin points out to only report </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the negative aspects of augmented </v>

159
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 1>existence and to to use augmented </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence as a validation for your larger</v>

160
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>ideological project in this case be </v>
<v Speaker 1>human restoration act,</v>

161
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.550
<v Speaker 1>a bill that would either remove or </v>
<v Speaker 1>severely limit to the augmentations that</v>

162
00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:48.384
<v Speaker 1>people have of course on like real world</v>
<v Speaker 1>news Pikus is news coverage is dictated </v>

163
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>by the Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was engineered</v>

164
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.993
<v Speaker 2>to monitor communications and data </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets to find out what people are </v>

165
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 2>talking about and make sure it's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed to correctly</v>

166
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.473
<v Speaker 1>as they cover up evidence of water </v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination in Prague and falsely </v>

167
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:10.060
<v Speaker 1>report that a flight was taken down by </v>
<v Speaker 1>an augmented terrorist</v>

168
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.563
<v Speaker 2>in yet another terror attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred and 51 passenger airlines </v>

169
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:17.374
<v Speaker 2>flight</v>

170
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.100
<v Speaker 1>rather than the truth that the plane was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot down by a military installation</v>

171
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.070
<v Speaker 2>plane went down because of whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military was doing there.</v>

172
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Not because of some augmented passenger </v>
<v Speaker 2>like bike is.</v>

173
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Clamps</v>

174
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>are these paranoia is don't tell us much</v>
<v Speaker 1>about reality itself,</v>

175
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:35.680
<v Speaker 1>but instead shine light on the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the paranoia for Dsx,</v>

176
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.623
<v Speaker 1>that reality is a carefully constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>story meant to combat augmentation so </v>

177
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:40.914
<v Speaker 1>that the Illuminati can better control </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population for their pro business </v>

178
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there an even deeper truth to the</v>

179
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.544
<v Speaker 1>way paranoia operates in the game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the real world is not governed by </v>

180
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 1>the Illuminati?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on who you ask,</v>

181
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 1>one could argue that it is governed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic principle,</v>

182
00:09:56.221 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>which the Illuminati in Dsx understands </v>
<v Speaker 1>this state of exception.</v>

183
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>According to philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giorgio Agamben,</v>

184
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.473
<v Speaker 1>there is a hidden law that why's behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>both modern liberal democracies and the </v>

185
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian regimes of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

186
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.043
<v Speaker 1>The exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this before in our </v>

187
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 1>walking dead and attack on titan videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

188
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex is exploration is wholly unique.</v>

189
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Accumbent builds off the theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

190
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.330
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always an asshole.</v>

191
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.163
<v Speaker 1>Carl Schmitt who argued that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>define sovereignty is not that the law </v>

192
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:26.454
<v Speaker 1>per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ability to suspend the law to </v>

193
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:29.724
<v Speaker 1>make the exception for Gambon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This suspension of law marks all </v>

194
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:33.894
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The concentration camps were a physical </v>

195
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 1>space where normal law was suspended for</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a decade,</v>

196
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.733
<v Speaker 1>a state of exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas our modern liberal democracies </v>

197
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.693
<v Speaker 1>aren't building death camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state of exception isn't always </v>

198
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:47.874
<v Speaker 1>imminent component of modern governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually in the name of a national </v>

199
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>emergency or an existential threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments today regularly create zones</v>

200
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>of exception where the law no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies or creates classes of people who</v>

201
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:00.324
<v Speaker 1>are outside the normal functioning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the law and thus exist in this kind of </v>

202
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.003
<v Speaker 1>exceptional state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prisoners of war protected by </v>

203
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:08.154
<v Speaker 1>international law get replaced by enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>combatants who gets sent to get mo were </v>

204
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 1>regular us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Law doesn't apply in DSX.</v>

205
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.803
<v Speaker 1>This logic seems implicit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory favorite fema in the </v>

206
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 1>name of managing emergencies.</v>

207
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>They build detention camps for political</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners and implement martial law,</v>

208
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.703
<v Speaker 1>be segregated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Udall at complex of mankind divided </v>

209
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 1>presents a similar zone of exception in </v>
<v Speaker 1>resembles a mix of apartheid era,</v>

210
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 1>South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish ghettos,</v>

211
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.771
<v Speaker 1>Becau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luned,</v>

212
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>wall city and Modern Day refugee camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The player witnesses horrifying examples</v>

213
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:40.494
<v Speaker 1>of police brutality and augmented people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who live in constant fear all in the </v>

214
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 1>name of security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when tensions boiled over,</v>

215
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>such as when an augmented rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist is assassinated,</v>

216
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.233
<v Speaker 1>the civil unrest justifies even more if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the illuminati wants to spread chaos </v>

217
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.393
<v Speaker 1>like staging a train station bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they understand that chaos </v>

218
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>breeds people desiring security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when people desire security,</v>

219
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's all the easier to suspend basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and exert more authority.</v>

220
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>While we may think of chaos and order as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposites,</v>

221
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 1>the game understands how they can become</v>
<v Speaker 1>entangled in the modern world.</v>

222
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.973
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is manufactured in discreet ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for oppressive powers to </v>

223
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>maintain control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but besides illuminating,</v>

224
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.044
<v Speaker 1>no pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how security operates even in our own </v>

225
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 1>non illuminati world.</v>

226
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.753
<v Speaker 1>They esx also uses the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception as just one of its many </v>

227
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:34.444
<v Speaker 1>criticisms of transhumanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transhumanism is the idea that </v>

228
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 1>technology will help us overcome human </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations like disease and scarcity,</v>

229
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 1>prosthetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact lenses,</v>

230
00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:44.914
<v Speaker 1>and in vitro fertilization or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping stones in the greater </v>

231
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.543
<v Speaker 1>transhumans project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transhumanism is baked into the very </v>

232
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:54.400
<v Speaker 1>idea of human augmentation asx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

233
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.050
<v Speaker 1>rather than blindly celebrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism,</v>

234
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.103
<v Speaker 1>it portends everything that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly go wrong as the human race </v>

235
00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:06.671
<v Speaker 1>unlock human potential and mastery over </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that technology becomes available</v>

236
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:11.180
<v Speaker 1>to individuals and groups and can </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially fall into the wrong hands.</v>

237
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.283
<v Speaker 1>Even augmentation technology developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Illuminati soon escaped their </v>

238
00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:18.800
<v Speaker 1>control as private corporations entered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fray,</v>

239
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.300
<v Speaker 1>this forced the Illuminati to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>their stance and oppose augmentation.</v>

240
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by going public with this discovery,</v>

241
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:27.634
<v Speaker 1>Saraf is forcing our hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Invisible war starts with a terrorist </v>

242
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>attack that turns everything into a grey</v>
<v Speaker 1>goose and in mankind divided,</v>

243
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:35.464
<v Speaker 1>there exists an underground market for </v>
<v Speaker 1>augmentations which is likely assisting </v>

244
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>both the good guys and bad guys.</v>

245
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.243
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destructive potential of technology </v>

246
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 1>often necessitates permanent states of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergencies and martial law.</v>

247
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>That accumbens work was critical of </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

248
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:51.844
<v Speaker 1>as technology gets to epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government will have little problem </v>

249
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 1>convincing you that your rights have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be suspended for the good of everyone,</v>

250
00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.493
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just the state of exception</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem for the transhumanist </v>

251
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>JBS Haldane,</v>

252
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.193
<v Speaker 1>one of the earliest thinkers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanism warrant in 1924 that </v>

253
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:09.214
<v Speaker 1>society would have a hard time keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>pace with the progress of technology in </v>

254
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:13.834
<v Speaker 1>data lists or science in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote that the tendency of applied </v>

255
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:17.734
<v Speaker 1>science is to magnify injustices until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they become to intolerable to be born </v>

256
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.653
<v Speaker 1>and the average man who all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits and poets could not move turns </v>

257
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>at last and extinguishes the evil at its</v>
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>

258
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology will make social injustice is</v>

259
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:37.050
<v Speaker 1>worse until societal anger will boil </v>
<v Speaker 1>over into a full on rage in Dsx.</v>

260
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.913
<v Speaker 1>More often than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of technology are thrust </v>

261
00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:41.944
<v Speaker 1>upon the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who are augmented need to </v>

262
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:44.614
<v Speaker 1>constantly take neuropazine to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body from rejecting their </v>

263
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:47.944
<v Speaker 1>augmentations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those with means can much more </v>

264
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.853
<v Speaker 1>easily obtained the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of manual laborers or </v>

265
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:56.380
<v Speaker 1>soldiers who are augmented by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>employers,</v>

266
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.273
<v Speaker 1>let me guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the laborers will mentored with </v>

267
00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:02.970
<v Speaker 1>heavy duty industrial rings or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government sends you what they want,</v>

268
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.193
<v Speaker 1>do what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace parts of you whenever and </v>

269
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:07.374
<v Speaker 1>however they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They exist in a precarious state where </v>

270
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:11.024
<v Speaker 1>the maintenance of their augmentations </v>
<v Speaker 1>is contingent on them maintaining the </v>

271
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:14.624
<v Speaker 1>same or similar job rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that human evolution through </v>

272
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:18.854
<v Speaker 1>technology will level the playing field </v>
<v Speaker 1>they isx suggests societal forces will </v>

273
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.384
<v Speaker 1>make inequality worse and just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haldane warns that this tension will </v>

274
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>cause people to rise up and root out </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil at its source.</v>

275
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.733
<v Speaker 1>We see two competing movements in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game focused on the same thing in human </v>

276
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The humanity front uses violence to stop</v>

277
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>the spread of augmentation and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind divided.</v>

278
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 1>A legal solution exists in the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>restoration act.</v>

279
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:43.933
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented people slowly entertained </v>

280
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:46.574
<v Speaker 1>violence as a political strategy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the assassination of Taylor's </v>

281
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.360
<v Speaker 1>rucker results in full on riot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:54.250
<v Speaker 1>would have rutgers death is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread,</v>

283
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.320
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>

284
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.670
<v Speaker 1>the head of state police assures me </v>
<v Speaker 1>Golem city will become a war zone.</v>

285
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.613
<v Speaker 1>Another idea trumpeted by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanists is the idea of the </v>

286
00:16:04.141 --> 00:16:06.960
<v Speaker 1>singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A point at which artificial intelligence</v>

287
00:16:06.961 --> 00:16:11.340
<v Speaker 1>will explode the rate of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>development in the original dsx.</v>

288
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.203
<v Speaker 1>Bob Page hopes to create his own twisted</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of this by merging with the </v>

289
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.913
<v Speaker 1>Helios Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead the player is given the </v>

290
00:16:18.421 --> 00:16:19.254
<v Speaker 1>option to merge with Helio's to rule the</v>
<v Speaker 1>posts singularity world as a benevolent </v>

291
00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:23.334
<v Speaker 1>dictator,</v>

292
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.633
<v Speaker 5>trenches.</v>

293
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.750
<v Speaker 1>The game doesn't necessarily put any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of judgment on this,</v>

294
00:16:34.751 --> 00:16:35.584
<v Speaker 1>but the solution still feels a bit icky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and afterwards when the merger between </v>

295
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:41.890
<v Speaker 1>JC tensen and Helio's doesn't go as </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned,</v>

296
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:42.843
<v Speaker 1>the technological infrastructure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world collapses and chaos envelops the </v>

297
00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:47.224
<v Speaker 1>world gc that's going black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The message is not so subtly found in </v>

298
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the name of the two ais that usher in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the singularity Daedalus and ICARUS</v>

299
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 5>and barriers between her falling.</v>

300
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.043
<v Speaker 1>According to legend Daedalus was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek inventor who invented </v>

301
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:11.404
<v Speaker 1>manmade flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His son ICARUS plummets to his death </v>

302
00:17:14.141 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>after using the invention to fly too </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the sun.</v>

303
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.033
<v Speaker 1>The collapse can be viewed in this light</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a too fast and too reckless </v>

304
00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:25.630
<v Speaker 1>technological development that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically crashing down.</v>

305
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Just don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything when they lost everything,</v>

306
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.570
<v Speaker 1>the world would fall to pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haldane believed.</v>

307
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 1>The only hope is for morality to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>pace with science dsx explores the moral</v>

308
00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:39.984
<v Speaker 1>questions inherent in our technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven future isn't right for companies </v>

309
00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:46.890
<v Speaker 1>to augment their workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of asking this beforehand,</v>

310
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 1>the prevailing logic and the game is </v>
<v Speaker 1>augment.</v>

311
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:50.154
<v Speaker 1>First ask questions later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about installing chips to limit a </v>

312
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 1>person's augmentation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they say go on a homicidal rage.</v>

313
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>A brief debate may happen on TV while </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislators are trying to pass the bill,</v>

314
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Speaker 1>but companies have already developed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology before anyone decides whether</v>

315
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>this technology should even exist.</v>

316
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Technology first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality later,</v>

317
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.323
<v Speaker 1>and that's a recipe for disaster in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to Nsx is forcing us to ask these </v>

318
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:17.694
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find tailless rucker offering a </v>

319
00:18:19.421 --> 00:18:20.254
<v Speaker 1>robust criticism of government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>limiting the abilities of the augmented </v>

320
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and even though we're a bit far from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack's arms,</v>

321
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>the Games can make us question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological progress in our own world.</v>

322
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Usually I would get a lot of press in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a knee,</v>

323
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.253
<v Speaker 1>but given that these social media has </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically redefined how we engage with </v>

324
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:41.664
<v Speaker 1>the world and we've only begun to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about its influenced after we </v>

325
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>suspect it's done something egregiously </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

326
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.253
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think wise crack will </v>
<v Speaker 1>arch like dsx convinced us to take a </v>

327
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 1>critical look at technology before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to universally adopted?</v>

328
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Or are we diving headfirst into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare?</v>

329
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.413
<v Speaker 1>And one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a world where people trying to </v>

330
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 1>succeed in places like Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catalonia,</v>

331
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 1>and even California seems to be getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>more popular.</v>

332
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>The original dsx seems weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophetic.</v>

333
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.763
<v Speaker 1>There's the national secessionist forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Texas is troubled attempt to leave </v>

334
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:16.260
<v Speaker 1>the union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how would that actually work?</v>

335
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Our friend Joseph at real life floor has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great video exploring the hypothetical</v>

336
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>secession of Texas where he and I are </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

337
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.173
<v Speaker 1>So go check out his video by clicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and be sure to tell them that wise </v>

338
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>crack sent you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

339
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

340
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.713
<v Speaker 1>Peace.</v>
