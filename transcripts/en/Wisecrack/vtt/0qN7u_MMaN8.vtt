1
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.863
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the power of conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get human beings to converge on a </v>

2
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>common project in which in which people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can collaborate in an open ended way,</v>

3
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>in a non divisive way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that that never requires a,</v>

4
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>an appeal to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

5
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.023
<v Speaker 1>and we have that in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have that in much of intellectual </v>

6
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:35.404
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We very much don't have that in </v>

7
00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:38.314
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's nothing that a </v>

8
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:40.534
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Christian and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Muslim can say to one </v>

9
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>another to put their beliefs on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table for,</v>

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>for revision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

11
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>this is what dogmatism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

12
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.913
<v Speaker 1>it is a willingness to believe things </v>
<v Speaker 1>for bad reasons and an unwillingness to </v>

13
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>have your rather tenuous reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>

14
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

16
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe this.</v>

17
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>No matter what anyone else says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

18
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the antithesis of conversation.</v>

19
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It really is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conversation stopper.</v>

20
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>that's why I paint a very stark </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between faith and reason.</v>

22
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason if you're a reasonable,</v>

23
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in how the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>works and what is true altogether,</v>

24
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>you are open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're by definition open to,</v>

25
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>to further conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to more argument,</v>

26
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>to more evidence and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in fact interested to find out if</v>

27
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>you're mistaken about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are not predisposed to that,</v>

28
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>that open ended conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.393
<v Speaker 1>you really have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have rendered yourself immune to </v>

30
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>influence from the world that influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from just having someone,</v>

31
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull out the guns on you.</v>

32
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:52.984
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are certain people because of </v>

33
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>their dogmatism who have made themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to talk to.</v>

34
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say to,</v>

35
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:01.794
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a Sama bin Ladin to reconsider </v>

36
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>his view of the world.</v>

37
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.453
<v Speaker 1>And it's a unique feature of religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we defend this mode of being in a </v>

38
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>religious context in a way that we would</v>
<v Speaker 1>never tolerate it in another context.</v>

39
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

40
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>if somebody has medical beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>if your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your doctor says,</v>

42
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this,</v>

43
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cures cancer,</v>

44
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell you how or why or,</v>

45
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have my data </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>

47
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

48
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a mode of talk within a medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>context that you would never get through</v>

49
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to those kinds of,</v>

50
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.323
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>intuitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.753
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really is the core of faith based </v>

53
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:40.174
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that there are certain things </v>

54
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.773
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bible is the perfect word of God or </v>

55
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>the Koran or the perfect word of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just have to be accepted,</v>

56
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>cannot be challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and in certain context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly within the Muslim world,</v>

58
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you can die for calling those </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainties into.</v>

59
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it literally is a capital offense to </v>

60
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.503
<v Speaker 1>wonder whether the Koran may not be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect word of the creator of the </v>

61
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:10.414
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it used to be a killing a fence </v>

63
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>within Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

64
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just we have moderated the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

65
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Judaism and Christianity to a remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree because of the last 200 years of,</v>

66
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>of scientific and political problem.</v>
