116
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:11.354
<v Speaker 1>lonely soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasted his life on a glorified video </v>

117
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:15.464
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this kind of future technology </v>

118
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>banging a busted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always.</v>

120
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>His players can get all the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

121
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking free information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free schooling and the ability to </v>

122
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>compensate with homies all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

123
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't check yourself,</v>

124
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you could end up isolating yourself from</v>
<v Speaker 1>any meaningful connections.</v>

125
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's the always is a utopia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopia.</v>

126
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be real.</v>

127
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.643
<v Speaker 1>That ass ain't so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll always give Paul struggling </v>

128
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:50.471
<v Speaker 1>folks access to education and jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since there ain't none on the outside,</v>

129
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.553
<v Speaker 1>but that also means that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring all the mess happening around </v>

130
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:58.470
<v Speaker 1>them in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which only makes that reality rock dish.</v>

131
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a utopia or dystopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fill me in a real world way.</v>

132
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>They ain't got no friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no benjamins and no respect,</v>

133
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>but in the oasis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a solid wrap,</v>

134
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>a nice cash flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a loyal crew.</v>

135
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.394
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just check this one sec way jabbering </v>

136
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>about how horrible is things used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>

137
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>but now they're kind of terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human civilization is in decline.</v>

138
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.043
<v Speaker 1>Some people even say is collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he started talking about his life </v>

139
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>like it's all tight and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I had access to the oasis,</v>

140
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>which was like having an escape hatch </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a better reality.</v>

141
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.323
<v Speaker 1>It was my playground and my preschool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a magical place where anything was </v>

142
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.184
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Oasis is the setting of all my </v>

143
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:43.544
<v Speaker 1>happiest Childhood Memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as escape the answer to living in a </v>

144
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:48.044
<v Speaker 1>jacked up world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it better to kick back and live a </v>

145
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>decent life and a fake world are be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle.</v>

146
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.103
<v Speaker 1>In reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should time Kaphar reality and </v>

147
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:57.984
<v Speaker 1>make it the place to be rather than just</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving up and piece them out to </v>

148
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>
