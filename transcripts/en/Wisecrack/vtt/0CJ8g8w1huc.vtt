00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>About a decade ago I realized that if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to go to Mars with people,</v>

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought to myself,</v>

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.743
<v Speaker 1>what activities have human cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in in the past that were as </v>

4
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:15.834
<v Speaker 1>expensive as what it might be to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars and what motivated them to spend </v>

5
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>that money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to fill a whole book,</v>

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>motivations to do great things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great expensive things,</v>

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>and then I find the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the task,</v>

8
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd find the activity that more most </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely resembled what it would be to go</v>

9
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>to Mars in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what that culture did with their</v>

11
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>population?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how they raised the money?</v>

12
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:43.524
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they convinced the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to fill a whole book of </v>

13
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a nice little reference catalog,</v>

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>but how to get something done in modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in conducting that exercise,</v>

15
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>what I found is that there only three </v>
<v Speaker 1>drivers,</v>

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>not more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not less,</v>

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>three drivers that account for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

18
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>ambitious projects humans have ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertaken.</v>

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the praise of deity or </v>
<v Speaker 1>royalty.</v>

20
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got You.</v>

21
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>The pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically expensive tombstones,</v>

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>so it got the cathedral and Church </v>
<v Speaker 1>building of Europe.</v>

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.953
<v Speaker 1>That was a period where huge fractions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of societal investment went into </v>

24
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>those activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's less of that today,</v>

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.373
<v Speaker 1>so that's not really a useful driver to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how we might transform the </v>

26
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another driver is war.</v>

27
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets you the Great Wall of China.</v>

28
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.613
<v Speaker 1>That gets you the Manhattan project </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we built the bond that gets you </v>

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the Apollo project.</v>

30
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Another driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this search for economic return,</v>

32
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to die.</v>

33
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The search for economic return.</v>

34
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what is responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus oranges,</v>

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>the Magellan voyage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Clark,</v>

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.763
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what is beyond that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontier in hugely expensive enterprise </v>

37
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.444
<v Speaker 1>is conducted by government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we're going to go to Mars and if </v>

38
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>war is not the driver did you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could easily become the driver.</v>

39
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.463
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we'd be getting another space race </v>

40
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we view as a military adversary,</v>

41
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>wonder who that might be.</v>

42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.103
<v Speaker 1>But if peaceful heads prevail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then war is not the driver available to </v>

44
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's check our list.</v>

45
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kings and gods are not sufficient in </v>

46
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>modern times to undergo heavy projects </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as that.</v>

47
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>What's left the promise of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>

48
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>You can go into space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform society changed the Zeitgeists</v>

49
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:45.644
<v Speaker 1>of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn everyone into people who embrace </v>

50
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>and value science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

51
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and math,</v>

52
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.343
<v Speaker 1>the stem fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not people go into space or </v>

53
00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:56.024
<v Speaker 1>serve the space industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will have the sensitivity to those </v>

54
00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.534
<v Speaker 1>fields to stimulate unending innovation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the technology and the technological </v>

55
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.564
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that innovation in the 21st </v>

56
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>century that will drive tomorrow's </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies?</v>

57
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Any frontier in space now involves </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists were looking for life.</v>

58
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geologists,</v>

59
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical engineering,</v>

60
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.930
<v Speaker 1>electrical engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aerospace engineer's astrophysicist.</v>

62
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.354
<v Speaker 1>All the traditional sciences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering frontiers are captured in </v>

63
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.504
<v Speaker 1>any ambitious goal to explore space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can recapture those times and </v>

64
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:38.854
<v Speaker 1>reinvent America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already invented American once </v>

65
00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ripe.</v>

66
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It's ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's willing,</v>

67
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be invented again.</v>
