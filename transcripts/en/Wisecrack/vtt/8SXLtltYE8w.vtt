<v Speaker 1>What's up wise?</v>

2
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:06.674
<v Speaker 1>Crack Jared again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're covering the only show </v>

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed to traumatize you in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>first 10 minutes.</v>

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Goblin slayer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:13.914
<v Speaker 1>while much of the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding the show focuses on that </v>

6
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:16.824
<v Speaker 1>notorious scene that we're all aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something else going on that is </v>

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>a really interesting development for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy genre and it all revolves around</v>

8
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:23.874
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does Goblin slayer only killed </v>

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>goblins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does that form the shows greater</v>

10
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>message?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.474
<v Speaker 1>let's bathe in Goblin blood and go deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this wise crack condition on Goblin </v>

12
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>slayer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as always,</v>

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's kick it off with a quick recap,</v>

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>a bright eyed priestess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has real names in this show.</v>

15
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And friends set out on their first </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure,</v>

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>eager to kill goblins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>things go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

18
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v Speaker 1>very wrong for friends die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Goblin slayer rescues her in the </v>

19
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.794
<v Speaker 1>nick of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She joins his party and becomes his </v>

20
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.404
<v Speaker 1>Goblin slaying paddle won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their party grows when an Elf dwarf and </v>

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.304
<v Speaker 1>Lizard man joined them to investigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>some particularly worrisome goblins on </v>

22
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.084
<v Speaker 1>the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they head off to kill even more </v>

23
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>sewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goblins,</v>

24
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.193
<v Speaker 1>all the while a demon lord is </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening the realm and our hero </v>

25
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>seriously does not care.</v>

26
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Niac the whole damn damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

27
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Key.</v>

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 2>The God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so today.</v>

29
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.703
<v Speaker 3>Cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

30
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he like you and I.</v>

31
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

32
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

33
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>There's actual narrative reasons they </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed his sister.</v>

34
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you about gun Greece,</v>

35
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>but because we like to get Metta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to address this question as it</v>

36
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>pertains to the genre that the show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

37
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's animated,</v>

39
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but the show is pretty heavy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>references to d and D.</v>

40
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>There's the dice rolling spell slots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilds,</v>

41
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.583
<v Speaker 1>quests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a hodgepodge of other fantasy </v>

42
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>tropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show relishes in the generics of the</v>

43
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>fantasy genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters and places have intentionally</v>

44
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>generic names as the show prefers labels</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Elvin,</v>

45
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:07.804
<v Speaker 1>ranger watertown or sword maiden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even big bosses get nomenclatures like </v>

46
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.693
<v Speaker 1>Goblin champion or demon Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about generic fantasy and </v>

47
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tabletop games or MMOS heroes start with</v>

48
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>the small stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>

49
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goblins.</v>

50
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.033
<v Speaker 1>They grind through these small </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges until they're ready to take </v>

51
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>on stronger and more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies,</v>

52
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>but then some horrifying villain emerges</v>
<v Speaker 1>and threatens the world as you know it.</v>

53
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>The story starts with small problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>builds to a big one,</v>

54
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>and once that big one is slane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things can go back to being peg.</v>

55
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Goblin slayer steps off that linear path</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a resounding,</v>

56
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.973
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather just kill goblins things you </v>

57
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.813
<v Speaker 1>rationalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is choice when his compatriots try </v>

58
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 1>to get them to care about more pressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

59
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about the globe edema,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moodle multiples?</v>

60
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.180
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

61
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.310
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chemo Goulburn,</v>

62
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>and we'll meet over to you and you know.</v>

63
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.783
<v Speaker 1>See even if the demon Lord dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Goblin slayer argues goblins will </v>

64
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>still terrorize rural and vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

65
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>By having our protagonists phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saul on the little guys of sorts,</v>

66
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>goblins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>player subverts the basic assumptions of</v>

67
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the fantasy genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely the happily ever after.</v>

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Do things go back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we've murdered,</v>

69
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the big bad guy has the hero achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace,</v>

70
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>not quite eight litany of less </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular monster.</v>

71
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Still plague the villagers in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent episode.</v>

72
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.624
<v Speaker 1>The Demon Lords death confirms this </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the constant reference to the </v>

73
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.314
<v Speaker 1>demon Lord earlier in the season would </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally foreshadows some kind of </v>

74
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:42.961
<v Speaker 1>climactic end of seasons showdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just say the opposite happens.</v>

75
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.613
<v Speaker 1>The demon Lord is dispatched in under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute by some random heroes that we </v>

76
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.574
<v Speaker 1>neither know nor care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of suggesting some happily </v>

77
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>ever after where instead reminded of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these words from the sword maiden</v>

78
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.730
<v Speaker 2>say the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

79
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>So can you pick a Canadian?</v>

80
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.160
<v Speaker 1>We can better understand Goblin slayers </v>
<v Speaker 1>logic.</v>

81
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.023
<v Speaker 1>What's something called theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much exactly what it </v>

82
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It asks,</v>

83
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.633
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is piece one theorist John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dalton draws a distinction between two </v>

84
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>kinds of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative.</v>

85
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.883
<v Speaker 1>Negative peace is the absence of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind of piece you're used to </v>

86
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:36.060
<v Speaker 1>talking about the end of World War II or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam war or the civil war.</v>

87
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.193
<v Speaker 1>You get it in the fantasy genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can think of it as the absence of </v>

88
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:40.794
<v Speaker 1>night canes or sour on organic door I e </v>
<v Speaker 1>o world without the demon lords </v>

89
00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:46.044
<v Speaker 1>destroying the world as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine and Dandy for peace </v>

90
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't examine these smaller and</v>

91
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:51.984
<v Speaker 1>often more pervasive violence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>affects society's most vulnerable </v>

92
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

93
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.380
<v Speaker 4>Do I need my job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Deal.</v>

94
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.543
<v Speaker 1>That's where positive piece comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Positive piece is the presence of </v>

95
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>justice and protections that serve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs of everyone,</v>

96
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>more or less what Goblin slayer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

97
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>while on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simply goblins in the real world.</v>

98
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It can be a litany of this poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>

99
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>

100
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:19.710
<v Speaker 1>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

101
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goblins of the real world,</v>

102
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive piece.</v>

103
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>It's especially important for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of violence.</v>

104
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.623
<v Speaker 1>For many folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence is an interruption to daily </v>

105
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:30.114
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some it's the backdrop against </v>

106
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 1>which life takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goblins,</v>

107
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.780
<v Speaker 1>slayer can't just chill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An idyllic farm with cowgirl,</v>

108
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:37.614
<v Speaker 1>which is really what they call her </v>
<v Speaker 1>without searching for signs of goblins </v>

109
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:40.944
<v Speaker 1>and fortifying defenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the platinum heroes that killed </v>

110
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:44.514
<v Speaker 1>the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord.</v>

111
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.940
<v Speaker 1>In goblin flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>view the shape of the world.</v>

112
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:53.774
<v Speaker 1>Guarantees that people are on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farms will always face gallbladder </v>

113
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:57.304
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why goblins slayer doesn't care </v>

114
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>about the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

115
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>he's busy burning down Goblin this now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may not seem very peaceful and it's</v>

116
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.504
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a question of conflict </v>

117
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:07.394
<v Speaker 1>prevention and development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so simply by taking care of the Goblin </v>

118
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:10.844
<v Speaker 1>problem in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goblin slayer starts the process of </v>

119
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.114
<v Speaker 1>longterm protection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just that smaller issues </v>

120
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>can compound to create an equally crappy</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

121
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.504
<v Speaker 1>For many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of small work that needs to be </v>

122
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.114
<v Speaker 1>done is balked at it's grunt work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants the glory of killing the </v>

123
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>demon Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but chopping goblins.</v>

124
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>That's child's play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when the demon Lord is gone,</v>

125
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>the clean up of his armies is below some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people</v>

126
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.270
<v Speaker 5>ada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he needed to eat all my money.</v>

127
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.980
<v Speaker 5>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

128
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no,</v>

129
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.423
<v Speaker 1>despite being a silver class adventure </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Goblin slayer is marked for his </v>

130
00:06:55.311 --> 00:07:00.311
<v Speaker 1>choice of missions in the hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventuring.</v>

131
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>He's like if general patent started </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning latrines,</v>

132
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.933
<v Speaker 1>but in the world of Goblin slayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toilets are going uncleaned because </v>

133
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.024
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to be the janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and without clean toilets we might just </v>

134
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>all die from Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so somebody has to do that work.</v>

135
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>We can see this sort of thing all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the place.</v>

136
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>In real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People take jobs that get all the glory,</v>

137
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.483
<v Speaker 1>so doctors researching cancer get all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the press while doctors doing routine </v>

138
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 1>work to test the water to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally deadly stomach illnesses.</v>

139
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>

140
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.143
<v Speaker 1>People take jobs that are high paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and high prestigious without much </v>

141
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>thought for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the highest social impact.</v>

142
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Even in sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to be the quarterback.</v>

143
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to be whatever a left </v>
<v Speaker 1>tackle is.</v>

144
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Goblins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slayer wanted to kill dragons as a child</v>

145
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:42.404
<v Speaker 1>and it's not until he sees the dangers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of goblins firsthand that he commits </v>

146
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:50.110
<v Speaker 1>himself to his mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would just sit and look at q three,</v>

147
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Twenty Coca Cola soda still weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

148
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>this is an even bigger problem than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems for two reasons.</v>

149
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.783
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stigma against Goblin slang causes </v>

150
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:05.910
<v Speaker 1>many to minimize the threat goblins </v>
<v Speaker 1>pose.</v>

151
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.173
<v Speaker 1>Slaying Goblins isn't complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mostly swing swords around and cut </v>

152
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>off heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can even apparently get killed by a</v>

153
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>strong kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

154
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean it's easy as we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the show,</v>

155
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.584
<v Speaker 1>goblins have tricks of their own that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make them very dangerous when </v>

156
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>they're perceived as a simple problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

157
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.853
<v Speaker 1>the people sent to deal with the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not qualified because aside from </v>

158
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:31.874
<v Speaker 1>Goblin slayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil ranked heroes have quote better </v>

159
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:34.784
<v Speaker 1>things to do,</v>

160
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.630
<v Speaker 6>quarter to sunken meadow bogus I with </v>
<v Speaker 6>them in it,</v>

161
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you ended up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations like this,</v>

162
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 1>so unqualified heroes get murdered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goblins stick around.</v>

163
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 1>That sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads us to our second issue.</v>

164
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>The problem worsens as the goblins breed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and become even more dangerous,</v>

165
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.683
<v Speaker 1>worse yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major heroes don't want to get involved </v>

166
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>because they think goblins are nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>but pes or they don't want to admit that</v>

167
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:06.894
<v Speaker 1>goblins or a real threat because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be embarrassing to say so enter </v>

168
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she is the ass kicking.</v>

169
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:13.824
<v Speaker 1>Super leader of priestesses religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She even slayed the original demon Lord </v>

170
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>with her big awesome sword.</v>

171
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Is there a name?</v>

172
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>She hires Goblins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slayer and his friends to deal with some</v>

173
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>goblins under the city who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably responsible for some murders,</v>

174
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.213
<v Speaker 1>but soon becomes obvious that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself committed some light murder to </v>

175
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 1>have the goblins taken care of by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

176
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

177
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I could assign a top</v>

178
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.483
<v Speaker 1>because she was afraid after her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic running and admitting that </v>

179
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of goblins after defeating</v>
<v Speaker 1>a demon.</v>

180
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Lord is definitely against the unspoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero code.</v>

181
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Goblin attacks can leave people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant state of fear and anxiety.</v>

182
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Those feelings contribute to an already </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult life for many,</v>

183
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:02.540
<v Speaker 1>and that again raises the stakes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive piece.</v>

184
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with goblins doesn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the material conditions of life,</v>

185
00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but definitely the psychological ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goblins slayers.</v>

186
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:10.544
<v Speaker 1>Intervention to kill the goblins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to the sword maiden about her </v>

187
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:15.620
<v Speaker 1>fears has a substantial effect on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing.</v>

188
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>She no longer has goblin nightmares.</v>

189
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 2>You mainly use English 30 minutes.</v>

190
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.930
<v Speaker 1>What's so interesting about this take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy is what we can expect it will do</v>

191
00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>to the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally,</v>

192
00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>as the series goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threads get bigger and scarier.</v>

193
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.413
<v Speaker 1>We even see this in standalone episodes </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we start off with regular goblins </v>

194
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and then the conflict escalates to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ogre,</v>

195
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.000
<v Speaker 1>but since the demon Lord has already </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten snowed ears,</v>

196
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.860
<v Speaker 1>your toes and the goblins slayers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>10th on only slaying goblins.</v>

197
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.190
<v Speaker 1>What creative ways will they come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with to up the stakes?</v>

198
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.233
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we'll see more ambiguity </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding the Goblin threat with this </v>

199
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.460
<v Speaker 1>false sense of security taking hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the land.</v>

200
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>The goblin problem will probably remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>in obscurity for most,</v>

201
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 1>but as we saw at the end of the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>

202
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>it's about to hit Goblin slayer much </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to home.</v>

203
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.723
<v Speaker 1>So is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna stay on Goblins or are we </v>

204
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.530
