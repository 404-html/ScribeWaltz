1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.713
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was this one meeting of that the </v>

2
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.103
<v Speaker 1>World Economic Forum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>conducts out of maybe 20 meetings during</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Year around the world.</v>

4
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.060
<v Speaker 1>But Davos is so called the annual </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>

5
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.183
<v Speaker 1>it is dinorah just of our meetings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the meeting which is attended by </v>

7
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:37.571
<v Speaker 1>the highest level of the participants </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a CEO's heads of state,</v>

8
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil society,</v>

9
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>international organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>and so every component of society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented there.</v>

11
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.983
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose is to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>major issues confronting us on a global </v>

12
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:00.494
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

13
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I think the effects have been very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very positive because the forum promotes</v>

14
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>dialogue between various stakeholders </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the form is,</v>

15
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.453
<v Speaker 1>the form is just a platform that brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>together people from all the components </v>

16
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:26.344
<v Speaker 1>of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sit down around the table and talk </v>

17
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:29.644
<v Speaker 1>about the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty unique because in </v>

18
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>today's world it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>hard to achieve anything without </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering all the stakeholders together.</v>

20
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.453
<v Speaker 1>It will achieve first understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues or awareness of some of the </v>

21
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:51.751
<v Speaker 1>issues and the form positions itself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a catalyst to action.</v>

22
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>So we're not ourselves involved directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>into doing something,</v>

23
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>we are a catalyst throughout those </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>

25
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:05.380
<v Speaker 1>those discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those meetings,</v>

26
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.813
<v Speaker 1>things come out of there are being put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in place either directly by some of the </v>

27
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>participants or by a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>participants.</v>

28
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>We have meetings in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Asia,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Africa and the Middle East in Europe,</v>

30
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
