4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Greetings and welcome to earthlink </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Garrick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where amyloid,</v>

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.993
<v Speaker 1>this week's artifact is up the film that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandated the Pixar rules that adults </v>

7
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>should cry as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film follows human boy,</v>

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.093
<v Speaker 1>Carl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose dream is to control the means of </v>

9
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>production so we can go to Paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>Falls,</v>

10
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like his hero,</v>

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.663
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Lenin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day a homeless girl named Ellie </v>

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>breaks his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They naturally fall in love,</v>

13
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:39.664
<v Speaker 1>and before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she dies just like all great </v>

14
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

15
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:46.804
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood's getting gentrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't sit right with Carl who </v>

16
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>knows a thing or two about sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

17
00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the thought of capitalism drives Carl so</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonkers.</v>

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.133
<v Speaker 1>He assaults Bob the builder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with no other options flees the </v>

19
00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>country and a pitiful excuse for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape pod.</v>

20
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.223
<v Speaker 1>Little does Carl know that a prediabetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cub scout is stowed away to earn his </v>

21
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>badge for the mile high club.</v>

22
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's those glasses because Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see they're heading into a tornado</v>

23
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.203
<v Speaker 1>or why kids love cinnamon toast crunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They narrowly survive and land right </v>

24
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>where they wanted to go without having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask for directions.</v>

25
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:20.614
<v Speaker 1>Once Karen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go the rest of their journey on </v>

26
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:23.914
<v Speaker 1>foot and take the house with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since there is no valet but not before </v>

27
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>befriending a talking horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi there and famous American actor Kevin</v>

28
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who legend has it was six degrees taller</v>

29
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 1>than everyone in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not so fast and the furious 15,</v>

30
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.483
<v Speaker 1>a group of other angrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more talkative horses all want a piece </v>

31
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:50.491
<v Speaker 1>of Kevin's bacon because I mean who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't unable to get a selfie.</v>

32
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.633
<v Speaker 1>They take Carl and the scout to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader because that's what minions do </v>

33
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:55.294
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taken to a Blimpie's where they </v>

34
00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:00.820
<v Speaker 1>learn the Pepsi twist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon has been in New Jersey this whole</v>

35
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 1>time trying to cast Kevin in a snuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

36
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Carl tells the boy scout not to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narc,</v>

37
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but as blood sugar spikes and he blabs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my new giant bird pet.</v>

38
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>They make a sweet escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remembering that horses don't flip,</v>

39
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.733
<v Speaker 1>but just like my ex wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin is two steps ahead and as lit the </v>

40
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>house on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin gets burdened down,</v>

41
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>so carl goes back to his original plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>of I guess dying in the Wilderness after</v>

42
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:26.314
<v Speaker 1>two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is until he finds an Amazon nook </v>

43
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>giving him the proper motivation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enter the third act,</v>

44
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 1>a battle royale ensues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not without some warmup stretching,</v>

45
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.980
<v Speaker 1>always stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl,</v>

46
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 1>let's his house go to and Lennon </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes he could have learned something</v>

47
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>from Kevin Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely how to get footloose,</v>

48
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Carl reunites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin with his bulimic children and back</v>

49
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:52.654
<v Speaker 1>in the big city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has probably been freaking out </v>

50
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>nonstop that someone was able to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly away using balloons.</v>

51
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Carl gives the boy scouts some tin that </v>
<v Speaker 1>said best.</v>

52
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.193
<v Speaker 1>Extremely heartwarming up illustrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of being trapped by </v>

53
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't cured until 20,</v>

54
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>67 by Dr Millie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Brown,</v>

55
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.823
<v Speaker 1>when his fwb dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl metaphorically and trines her in </v>

56
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>the house that they built together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He keeps everything exactly as it was to</v>

57
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>preserve her memory and to keep her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost happy outside.</v>

58
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:22.924
<v Speaker 1>The world may keep trucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Carl clings to the past even though </v>

59
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>he may be in the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The house itself symbolizes corals,</v>

60
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.364
<v Speaker 1>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he has to carry with them until </v>

61
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.614
<v Speaker 1>the housing market improves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin is in many ways Carl's foxy or </v>

62
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.953
<v Speaker 1>counterpart like Carl's condo linens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air Ship is a museum of artifacts from </v>

63
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.584
<v Speaker 1>better times like the Jurassic Age and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mission of Redemption Parallels </v>

64
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Carol's journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight called me a fraud.</v>

65
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Those should I bring back this creature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my name will be cleared,</v>

66
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>but just as Carl can't bring his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

67
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.014
<v Speaker 1>no matter how many houses he knocks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon can't bring back the glory days </v>

68
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>through sniping the snipe.</v>

69
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.593
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a snipe hunt is a colloquial term for a </v>

70
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.264
<v Speaker 1>wild grey goose chase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a naive person is fooled into </v>

71
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>chasing after something that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist like love up.</v>

72
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>A poignant message about coping with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grief and a healthy gluten free way.</v>

73
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.953
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl cares about nothing besides his </v>

74
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:19.354
<v Speaker 1>super dead wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as he develops affection for the </v>

75
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.904
<v Speaker 1>scout and Kevin Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he develops a new selfless purpose that </v>

76
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:25.744
<v Speaker 1>helps him move on to save the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl must divest himself of the past by </v>

77
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:29.914
<v Speaker 1>littering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Carl passes on the badge that Lee </v>

78
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:32.674
<v Speaker 1>gave him as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realized her memory has transformed </v>

79
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:35.974
<v Speaker 1>from a burden around his neck to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something positive that he can share </v>

80
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.693
<v Speaker 1>once hobbled by grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new Carl abandoned his walker and </v>

81
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>can once again move freely through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

82
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>You know what Gabe of proving once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all Western medicine was a lie.</v>

83
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 1>The film posits that instead of bold </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures,</v>

84
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>the best pursuits are the simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasures of everyday life,</v>

85
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>like enjoying a cup of Joe on the porch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your spaceship.</v>

86
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.463
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russel claims he wants to explore </v>

87
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>unknown lands and claim them for the boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>scouts of America,</v>

88
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.663
<v Speaker 1>but his happiest moments are his </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories about eating dippin dots with </v>

89
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:11.030
<v Speaker 1>his deadbeat dad,</v>

90
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I always get chocolate and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfree.</v>

91
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.673
<v Speaker 2>Might sound boring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the boring stuff is the </v>

92
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 2>stuff I remember the most</v>

93
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>for all of Lennon's glorious exploits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more alone than Florida.</v>

94
00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:23.594
<v Speaker 1>Mom on sector five at Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while the childhood portion of </v>

95
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Ellie's adventure book is full of dreams</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paradise falls,</v>

96
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.280
<v Speaker 1>the mature Ellie filled the book with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Raci photographs of her life.</v>

97
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:35.114
<v Speaker 1>With Carl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moral is to enjoy the simple things </v>

98
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.503
<v Speaker 1>like the love and companionship of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and avoid the bad things like </v>

99
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:42.854
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping and trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minor to South America for earthlink </v>

100
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:47.210
