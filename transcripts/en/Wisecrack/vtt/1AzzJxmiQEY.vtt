<v Speaker 1>Can take off the role with the makeup </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the costume.</v>

2
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously if you've,</v>

3

4
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 2>that has tremendous moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that doesn't just leave you.</v>

5
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I remember once actually was here on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Broadway,</v>

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I was in Martin Sherman play bent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an extraordinary love story.</v>

7
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very daring and you know,</v>

8
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 2>pushing the envelope drama about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

9
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals in a sent to a camp and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark and dangerous.</v>

10
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 2>But at the core of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wonderful story,</v>

11
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 2>human monetarian story of love between </v>
<v Speaker 2>two unlikely man.</v>

12
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great play.</v>

13
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>And One night there was a young girl at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stage door and uh,</v>

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.993
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to the play tonight with my </v>

16
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 2>mother and I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

17
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.323
<v Speaker 2>my mother was in a concentration camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and under some of the things described </v>

18
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 2>in the play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things happen to her.</v>

19
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>And I went cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

20
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this girl going to say?</v>

21
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 2>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:25.871
<v Speaker 2>welfare act to trivialize or miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 2>to reduce her experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her memories.</v>

24
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I'd just like to thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

26
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 2>my mother has never been able to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the experience.</v>

27
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 2>But seeing the play was like a key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It unlocked the experience for her.</v>

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 2>And she's talking about it for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

29
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

30
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

31
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>this is the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we said earlier,</v>

32
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 2>going back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Greek origins,</v>

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being sort of sacred,</v>

34
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

36
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:01.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>if I never do anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

38
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>this one night is valuable.</v>
