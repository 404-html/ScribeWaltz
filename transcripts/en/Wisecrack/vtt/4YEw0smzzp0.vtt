8
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:32.324

<v Speaker 1>but a lot of our best video ideas start </v>

20
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onto the recap.</v>

21
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.623
<v Speaker 1>Akira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a teenage boy known for crying over </v>

22
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:08.354
<v Speaker 1>almost anything is living with the Maki </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mora family while his parents traveled </v>

23
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>the world providing free medical care </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he tries to save his crush.</v>

24
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Slash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Housemate Mickey Mckee,</v>

25
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Maura from what looks like a gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aki raise interrupted by his trigger.</v>

26
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Happy adoptive brother and childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Rio.</v>

27
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.373
<v Speaker 1>Recently back in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After a research project in South </v>

28
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio tells Akira what he learned abroad,</v>

29
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.493
<v Speaker 1>namely that devils are real and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are possessing human beings trying </v>

30
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:35.324
<v Speaker 1>to collect proof of his theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio Takes Acura to a drug fueled sex </v>

31
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.464
<v Speaker 1>party called Sabbath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where his bloody rampage actually </v>

32
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>succeeds in summoning a group of demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of whom tries to possess Acura.</v>

33
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>That demon Ayman fails to take over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Akira completely.</v>

34
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Acura gains the strength and power of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil,</v>

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's still in control of his mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and body.</v>

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.023
<v Speaker 1>You're a man who possesses both the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a devil as well as the heart of a </v>

37
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>human devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

38
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>while Rio and occupy initially planned </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use his powers to fight the devils,</v>

39
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>the show gradually reveals that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more to Rio's plan when the demon thread</v>

40
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:10.814
<v Speaker 1>is revealed to the Public Rio gains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immense influence with world leaders </v>

41
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.803
<v Speaker 1>turns on OC Euro and promotes policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>which encouraged the murder of not only </v>

42
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>devils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but millions of human beings.</v>

43
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 1>This all comes to a head in the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal.</v>

44
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>You seen him say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

45
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Followed by a massive human devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devil,</v>

46
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>man battle culminating in the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

47
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>So how did we get from a bad night at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the club to the fricking apocalypse?</v>

48
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer has to do with two distinct </v>

49
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but related concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral panics and threat construction.</v>

50
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Sociologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Cohen,</v>

51
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:44.114
<v Speaker 1>argues that mass media constructs a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral panic directed at certain groups </v>

52
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:52.481
<v Speaker 1>of people by portraying their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>as deviant society labels these people a</v>

53
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:53.774
<v Speaker 1>threat which justifies excessive social </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and policing over the quote </v>

54
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.963
<v Speaker 1>demonized as he puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media informs us about right and </v>

55
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.514
<v Speaker 1>wrong about the boundaries beyond which </v>
<v Speaker 1>one should not venture and about the </v>

56
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:09.270
<v Speaker 1>shapes that the devil can assume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Devil may cry.</v>

57
00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Baby references a few well known moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>panics.</v>

58
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.263
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local news falsely identifies the young </v>

59
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.324
<v Speaker 1>rappers as members of a gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mistake and their resemblance to be </v>

60
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.764
<v Speaker 1>constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stereotype of violent youth nearly gets </v>

61
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>them shot by police even as they try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate with the officers.</v>

62
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.993
<v Speaker 1>The show also references the archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral panic which hunts for her almost </v>

63
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>supernatural speed.</v>

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Miki is known to the media as up is </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach of track and field.</v>

65
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mob calls her a witch.</v>

66
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>She's an outsider before killing her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning her body.</v>

67
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.183
<v Speaker 1>More to the point though is reos use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass media to create a moral panic over </v>

68
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:49.414
<v Speaker 1>devils after triggering code has </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation at the track meet and </v>

69
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>causing a massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio uses his live stream too,</v>

70
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>so fear and mistrust among the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

71
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.073
<v Speaker 1>demons exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be one right next to you </v>

72
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.383
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage of his academic title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio claims to be merely a reporter of </v>

73
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

74
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.473
<v Speaker 1>he uses multiple media outlets including</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media and traditional </v>

75
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>broadcasting to promote as much fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoia,</v>

76
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>and violence as possible</v>

77
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 2>in this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huggins,</v>

78
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that we will win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again.</v>

79
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 1>As the end of the world draws closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan slash Rio encourages more and more</v>

80
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:29.354
<v Speaker 1>violence by expanding the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>devils to include anyone deviating from </v>

81
00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:36.710
<v Speaker 1>the social norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He falsely implies that deviant behavior</v>

82
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 1>is a proven indicator of the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn into a devil.</v>

83
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.913
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfied with society can </v>

84
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:46.320
<v Speaker 2>potentially turn into a demon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

85
00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 2>So then in order for us to defeat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demons,</v>

86
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 2>we must eradicate them before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become demons.</v>

87
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>He pulls off the same feet at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international level.</v>

88
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Through our process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scholars call the red construction.</v>

89
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.233
<v Speaker 1>Certain camps of foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists argue that many international </v>

90
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:06.020
<v Speaker 1>trends positive by national leaders are </v>
<v Speaker 1>largely constructed.</v>

91
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 1>That is issues become threats when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in positions of power define them</v>

92
00:05:10.191 --> 00:05:12.860
<v Speaker 1>as such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like creating a moral panic.</v>

93
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.723
<v Speaker 1>Threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Construction involves identifying some </v>

94
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.603
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be another country and </v>

95
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

96
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.233
<v Speaker 1>and defining its otherness as a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is portrayed as not merely a </v>

97
00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:25.334
<v Speaker 1>physical threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a threat to the very identity of a </v>

98
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:28.244
<v Speaker 1>domestic state political scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Campbell explains that in the </v>

99
00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:31.904
<v Speaker 1>process of threat construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other becomes the barbarian who </v>

100
00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:38.210
<v Speaker 1>stands in opposition to the quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized self.</v>

101
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.163
<v Speaker 1>Following this model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio manipulates inherent weaknesses in </v>

102
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:46.040
<v Speaker 1>US foreign policy to start world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>three beginning a nuclear conflict which</v>

103
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:46.874
<v Speaker 1>wipes human life from existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rio takes part in a high level </v>

104
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.510
<v Speaker 1>government discussion about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle the threat posed by the devils.</v>

105
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.403
<v Speaker 1>By this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're leaders have bought into reos </v>

106
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>logic completely and have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>distrustful of one another.</v>

107
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>We must be careful of the movements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring countries.</v>

108
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>There's information that they've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>been taken over by the demons.</v>

109
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.733
<v Speaker 1>In response to the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s government reflexively </v>

110
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>identifies a Russia as a quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geography of evil,</v>

111
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>a term coined by Campbell and declares </v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil.</v>

112
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Possessions are the product of a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>bioweapon.</v>

113
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.393
<v Speaker 3>The U s department of National Defense </v>
<v Speaker 3>closed its borders in response to the </v>

114
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:24.880
<v Speaker 3>possibility of demons being rushes </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological weapons</v>

115
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.923
<v Speaker 1>in devil man crybaby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s and Russia respond to the </v>

116
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:28.624
<v Speaker 1>devil's much as real world governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to terrorism because the threat </v>

117
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.360
<v Speaker 1>is barbaric and a threat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

118
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.070
<v Speaker 1>No measure is too extreme to stop them </v>
<v Speaker 1>including nuclear war.</v>

119
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.193
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like this.</v>

120
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.780
<v Speaker 4>The minute sure threatens our cow.</v>

121
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:43.763
<v Speaker 1>The show explores the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing up artificial boundaries </v>

122
00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:47.154
<v Speaker 1>between groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bloodshed and heartbreak that fills </v>

123
00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:50.394
<v Speaker 1>up the last few episodes are a direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of the public's willingness to </v>

124
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.190
<v Speaker 1>buy into rios us versus them mentality.</v>

125
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you can run faster than people </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're a demon.</v>

126
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 5>You think you're better than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Japanese.</v>

127
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>This preoccupation with boundaries is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also reflected in the show's exploration</v>

128
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>of what's called dual list metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

129
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Doulas and posits that reality is binary</v>
<v Speaker 1>or oppositional in nature,</v>

130
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.583
<v Speaker 1>composed of two eternally clashing </v>
<v Speaker 1>irreconcilable forces such as good and </v>

131
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:20.534
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the classic examples of the list </v>

132
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:23.184
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is the ancient religion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manichaean as religious scholar Todd </v>

133
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>calder explains according to Manichaean </v>
<v Speaker 1>dualism,</v>

134
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.253
<v Speaker 1>the universe is the product of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing battle between good and evil </v>

135
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:33.344
<v Speaker 1>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are in a constant battle for </v>

136
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first glance,</v>

137
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the show appears full of binary </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppositions,</v>

138
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>which will never be resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

139
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Rio is distinguished from AH,</v>
<v Speaker 1>era by his inability to shed tears,</v>

140
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>which serves as a visual cue for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to feel emotion.</v>

141
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Why would I cry?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sad it was going to die.</v>

142
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

143
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.343
<v Speaker 1>the show also sets up a sharp divide </v>
<v Speaker 1>between fear based violence and the </v>

144
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Maki.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morris Christian passivism,</v>

145
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the people who was following </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus pulled out his sword,</v>

146
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.820
<v Speaker 1>attack the soldier and cut off his ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then Jesus said to him,</v>

147
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.150
<v Speaker 1>put away your sword and return it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheath.</v>

148
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.103
<v Speaker 1>Rio is a doulas to the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He describes Devil's as fundamentally </v>

149
00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:15.510
<v Speaker 1>lacking in the human capacity to feel</v>

150
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 5>devils have existed on earth since long </v>
<v Speaker 5>before humans.</v>

151
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 5>They are ferocious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely savage and have no emotions.</v>

152
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 1>What's more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show takes that Manichaean idea of a</v>

153
00:08:26.161 --> 00:08:26.994
<v Speaker 1>battle between good and evil substances </v>
<v Speaker 1>very literally real first discovers the </v>

154
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:32.094
<v Speaker 1>existence of devils when the corpse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his formerly possessed professor is </v>

155
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.290
<v Speaker 1>revealed to wait twice the size it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was alive.</v>

156
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.213
<v Speaker 1>This possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words was not only spiritual </v>

157
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>but physical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A case of two bodies,</v>

158
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 1>one good and the other evil fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same space.</v>

159
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.393
<v Speaker 1>The show emphasizes the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of this battle between good </v>

160
00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 1>and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever a devil successfully takes over</v>

161
00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:52.704
<v Speaker 1>a human host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often ripping apart their body in the </v>

162
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>process over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

163
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>devil man crybaby winds up turning this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dualistic model completely on its head.</v>

164
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.423
<v Speaker 1>The show reveals the socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed nature of the dichotomies </v>

165
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:05.994
<v Speaker 1>many of his characters take for granted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and argues that reality is far too </v>

166
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>complex to be put in terms of black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

167
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>As panic over the devil's thread reaches</v>
<v Speaker 1>its tipping point.</v>

168
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>The show blurs the line between good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

169
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the more obvious examples is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Akira,</v>

170
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>who by his very nature challenges reos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dualistic model of the world.</v>

171
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.223
<v Speaker 1>In one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he combines devil and human good and </v>

172
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.543
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this when Auc euro in his devil </v>

173
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:32.484
<v Speaker 1>man form stands between an angry lynch </v>
<v Speaker 1>mob and its targets and offers up his </v>

174
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:38.830
<v Speaker 1>life for theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Chili Java?</v>

175
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to kill someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just chill van stead,</v>

176
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 1>defying the angry and fearful humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>

177
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.693
<v Speaker 1>By contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see an example of supposedly good </v>

178
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.860
<v Speaker 1>humans resorting to evil when the mob </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismembers and Burns Mucky,</v>

179
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:54.694
<v Speaker 1>mucky Maura for her public supportive </v>
<v Speaker 1>Akira and other devilment devil man </v>

180
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:02.370
<v Speaker 1>crybaby also loves to play around with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dichotomies surrounding gender and sex.</v>

181
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.383
<v Speaker 1>The show regularly hints at an ambiguous</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Queer relationship between hockey </v>

182
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>era and Rio.</v>

183
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.513
<v Speaker 1>Aqua remains invested in his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>openly display emotion even after being </v>

184
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>mocked for it as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the heck is crying?</v>

185
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Even though he's a boy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in his final form,</v>

186
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Satan embodies both male and female sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>

187
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps most interesting is the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show blurs.</v>

188
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:26.094
<v Speaker 1>The line between devils stand ins for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outcasts and scapegoats of society </v>

189
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.593
<v Speaker 1>and the humans they're supposed to be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from Mr Machimura eventually </v>

190
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>finds his wife and their son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toro in a refugee camp.</v>

191
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the reunion he'd hoped for.</v>

192
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Toro now possessed by the devil can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>control his own hunger any longer.</v>

193
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>His father arrives to find him in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonic form,</v>

194
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>eating his own mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Machimura tries to fall back on these</v>

195
00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:53.564
<v Speaker 1>socially constructed dichotomy between </v>
<v Speaker 1>devils and humans to reduce Tarro twin </v>

196
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>evil creature and make some sense of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror confronting him.</v>

197
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>God are no longer my sweet son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is for your Oh God,</v>

198
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but in the end he can't help but see his</v>
<v Speaker 1>human son in the devil's crying eyes,</v>

199
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>please don't show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

200
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.283
<v Speaker 1>The show also provides plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence to exhibit that contrary to </v>

201
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Rio's claim that devils are incapable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

202
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.343
<v Speaker 1>They're actually quite capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling love for each other and in some </v>

203
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 1>cases for humans in the episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Siren,</v>

204
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.993
<v Speaker 1>a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets into what can only be described </v>

205
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>as a deadly sex battle with styrene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former lover of acuras devil.</v>

206
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the first round of their fight,</v>

207
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Acura and nearly kills siren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as she lies bleeding out,</v>

208
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>her partner came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to her aid,</v>

209
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.113
<v Speaker 1>offering new give up his life so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she can merge with his body and live </v>

210
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:53.061
<v Speaker 1>long enough to kill devil man site </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodied.</v>

211
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came sacrifice even causes siren to cry.</v>

212
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Most impressive of all is the change </v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes over Satan himself.</v>

213
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>As a result of his experiences with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Akira,</v>

214
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.783
<v Speaker 1>having revealed his true form to Akira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan admits that he made the merging </v>

215
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.104
<v Speaker 1>between him and Ayman possible so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Okoro would be able to survive the </v>

216
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:16.880
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse and live with him forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

217
00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>a Kiddo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's live in the new world together.</v>

218
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I made you merge with the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

219
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.913
<v Speaker 1>For that very reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more when Satan Kills Aki era </v>

220
00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:27.344
<v Speaker 1>during their battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came up the devils experiences grief </v>

221
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>for the first time and cries over era </v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

222
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.220
<v Speaker 6>He's awfully</v>

223
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.230
<v Speaker 1>by pointing out fluidity where we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect to find hard boundaries.</v>

224
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.123
<v Speaker 1>Dell man crybaby asks us to think hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the labels we apply to others and </v>

225
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:53.730
<v Speaker 1>the potential consequences of black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white thinking.</v>

226
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.400
<v Speaker 1>The show puts forward some tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

227
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Who benefits from media scapegoating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what ends?</v>

228
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.253
<v Speaker 1>To what extent does rhetoric play a role</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the identification of threats and </v>

229
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.600
<v Speaker 1>what are the dangers of being too ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>to draw lines between self and other and</v>

230
00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:10.434
<v Speaker 1>in a world where categories as basic as </v>
