00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.783
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is cracked so over the years you </v>

2
00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>guys know it's been our mission to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lens of philosophy,</v>

3
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:08.494
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the humanities to achieve a greater </v>

4
00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:13.870
<v Speaker 1>appreciation of art and hopefully to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enrich people's lives,</v>

5
00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>but today we're doing something a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit different.</v>

6
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>This is ground zero of science content </v>
<v Speaker 1>on wisecracking.</v>

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.123
<v Speaker 1>For that I decided to bring on someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a lot smarter than I am when it </v>

8
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>comes to science.</v>

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Helen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey guys.</v>

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.843
<v Speaker 1>So today we are starting with a wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack favorite to see if we can connect </v>

11
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:29.624
<v Speaker 1>some of the philosophical themes that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about with existing research and </v>

12
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and psychology.</v>

13
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So today we're starting with one punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Also want to give a quick shout out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.org</v>

17
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Give it over to Helen.</v>

18
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is it hey wise crack Helen here.</v>

19
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>So it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey wisecrack held here.</v>

20
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 1>You got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one,</v>

21
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:53.171
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three up,</v>

22
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

23
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wise crack.</v>

24
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Helen here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

25
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Now say it faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

26
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack Helen here and today we're putting</v>

27
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 2>the boldest bad ass in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the microscope in one punch,</v>

28
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our protagonists site trauma is a salary</v>

29
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:08.764
<v Speaker 2>man turned hero who possesses no special</v>
<v Speaker 2>powers apart from the strength he's </v>

30
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>gained through his intense training </v>
<v Speaker 2>regimen.</v>

31
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.333
<v Speaker 2>100 pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 sit ups and 100 squats that a 10 </v>

32
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 2>kilometer run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it every single day,</v>

33
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 2>and now he can defeat every enemy with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>single punch.</v>

34
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Sounds cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lack of challenge leave site to my </v>

36
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detached and unfulfilled.</v>

37
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh they took was one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dreaming of becoming the best at </v>

38
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 2>anything is pretty much being human one </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one,</v>

39
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.743
<v Speaker 2>but the site is dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reflect our growing scientific </v>

40
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how humans can live a </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfying life.</v>

41
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.773
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to this special wise crack </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition on the science of one punch </v>

42
00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as always,</v>

43
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.173
<v Speaker 2>spoilers ahead with no real challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cytoma loses his enthusiasm for battle </v>

44
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 2>much to the irritation of his rivals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He blows them off.</v>

45
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Repairs to witness the true power.</v>

46
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I got dirt and my special pans place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

47
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.060
<v Speaker 2>are you even listening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insults them.</v>

48
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.923
<v Speaker 2>What a let down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty excited to see the battle </v>

49
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:16.864
<v Speaker 2>suits I'd been hearing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the design is pretty lame and all </v>

50
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:20.344
<v Speaker 2>they do is give you superhuman strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>and occasionally has the audacity to </v>

51
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:24.814
<v Speaker 2>yawn during a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that really seem like sysomos </v>

52
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 2>enjoying himself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we've mentioned before,</v>

53
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.543
<v Speaker 2>philosophers like Masa Hero Morioka have</v>
<v Speaker 2>argued that challenge is a necessary </v>

54
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:34.774
<v Speaker 2>component of a meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then as our lives become more </v>

55
00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 2>efficient and therefore less </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging,</v>

56
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 2>our mental health pays the price</v>

57
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 3>we will continue to ride until food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing,</v>

58
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 3>and shelter are provided free of charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To those who do not work</v>

59
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.543
<v Speaker 2>sounds pretty boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out this isn't just </v>

60
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:53.020
<v Speaker 2>philosophical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grandstanding science suggests there's a</v>

61
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:57.250
<v Speaker 2>biological basis for the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The challenging ourselves is good for us</v>

62
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just our mental health </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's at stake.</v>

63
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>If we always take it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neuroscientists,</v>

64
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.064
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Madsen argues that the </v>

65
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.774
<v Speaker 2>pervasiveness of what he calls </v>
<v Speaker 2>unchallenging lifestyles prevents us </v>

66
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 2>from activating adaptive stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>responses.</v>

67
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.103
<v Speaker 2>A series of changes that take place at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cellular level when an organism is </v>

68
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 2>exposed to danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how it works.</v>

69
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.673
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're walking down the alley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you encounter a giant Kelp and </v>

70
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:21.514
<v Speaker 2>crusted monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain activates your sympathetic </v>

71
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:24.544
<v Speaker 2>nervous system or the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system that turns on the fight </v>

72
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.024
<v Speaker 2>or flight response by sending out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecule from the hypothalamus and </v>

73
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>almond shaped area toward the center of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>

74
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.413
<v Speaker 2>This molecule tells the pituitary gland </v>
<v Speaker 2>to send out another molecule which sets </v>

75
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 2>off a series of reactions in the adrenal</v>
<v Speaker 2>gland above the kidneys.</v>

76
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>That ultimately leads to the release of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a substance called Cortisol,</v>

77
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.603
<v Speaker 2>Aka the stress hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nickname comes from the fact that </v>

78
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the main hormone involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress response,</v>

79
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.873
<v Speaker 2>and while there's always a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseline amount circulating through the </v>

80
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those levels increase.</v>

81
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 2>When your fight or flight response turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

82
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.803
<v Speaker 2>that extra quarters all prompts your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body to do things like break down sugar </v>

83
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.104
<v Speaker 2>to give you energy and numb the pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>response so you'd be more likely to </v>

84
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.284
<v Speaker 2>fight through an injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also turns down the part of your </v>

85
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 2>immune system that fights off viruses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and certain kinds of bacteria.</v>

86
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.883
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is to push the energy you need </v>

87
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>to fight infection to other more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important tasks that'll help you survive</v>

88
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and immediate threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this happens now and then it works,</v>

89
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>kind of like endurance training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body learns how to respond to acute</v>

90
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 2>stress more efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's constant,</v>

91
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.783
<v Speaker 2>you can wind up with a botched immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>system as your body becomes less </v>

92
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.294
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can lead to chronic inflammation </v>

93
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>because there's nothing stopping your </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune system from running on high,</v>

94
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>which can lead to a host of other health</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

95
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>We might consider dominator of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

96
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:42.484
<v Speaker 2>Lord boroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an exaggerated metaphor for this </v>

97
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

98
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.693
<v Speaker 4>my species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the struggle for survival amid the </v>

99
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 4>harsh environment of our home </v>
<v Speaker 4>repossessed,</v>

100
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate in regenerative ability</v>

101
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 2>are you able to regrow entire limbs is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty potent adaptive stress response.</v>

102
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fictional starfish,</v>

103
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.283
<v Speaker 2>a well known limb regenerator Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burrells also points out that the </v>

104
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:04.854
<v Speaker 2>extreme strength he exudes and battle is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so taxing that it actually shortens his </v>

105
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>life if he uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too often.</v>

106
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Doing this place is enormous stress on </v>
<v Speaker 4>my body.</v>

107
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Similar to anaerobic exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a result,</v>

108
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.450
<v Speaker 4>it's Jordan's my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same</v>

109
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.283
<v Speaker 2>problem humans run into when our fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>or flight response goes into overdrive </v>

110
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.004
<v Speaker 2>for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists like Dr Mattson say humans </v>

111
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:26.034
<v Speaker 2>are evolutionarily adapted to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental challenges and then not </v>

112
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:30.114
<v Speaker 2>having them on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly in the form of not enough </v>

113
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:33.084
<v Speaker 2>physical exertion or too little exposure</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the natural toxins found in plants </v>

114
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.013
<v Speaker 2>can lead to the prolonged inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>states that have been linked to </v>

115
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:41.550
<v Speaker 2>everything from Alzheimer's to diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cancer.</v>

116
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Inflammation causes changes in DNA and </v>
<v Speaker 2>since DNA contains the code for creating</v>

117
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.214
<v Speaker 2>all the proteins in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonky DNA can result in misshape and </v>

118
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:50.874
<v Speaker 2>proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those can go on to screw up hormone </v>

119
00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 2>regulation and encourage out of control </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell growth.</v>

120
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.303
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer from Dr Matson's perspective </v>

121
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.503
<v Speaker 2>without challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body isn't given opportunities to </v>

122
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>strengthen its defenses that is improved</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adoptive stress response,</v>

123
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 2>so when something starts to go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a hard time fixing it.</v>

124
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.883
<v Speaker 2>Outside of the physical effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lack of conflict introduces a similar </v>

125
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:13.604
<v Speaker 2>logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Operates psychologically will cite them </v>

126
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:16.234
<v Speaker 2>or may not be getting diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got some issues going on </v>

127
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:20.264
<v Speaker 2>in his brain parts through the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can see how enduring challenges can </v>

128
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>make you more mentally resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take genos.</v>

129
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.763
<v Speaker 2>He's faced certain challenges that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't faced on what we know from the </v>

130
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.394
<v Speaker 2>show site has had it pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get into the crime fighting </v>

131
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.084
<v Speaker 2>business to avenge the death of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>family or bring justice to the </v>

132
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.120
<v Speaker 2>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just did it for fun fast one.</v>

133
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a guy who's a hero for fun.</v>

134
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.473
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis backstory is much more </v>

135
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.174
<v Speaker 2>traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He witnessed the destruction of his </v>

136
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 2>hometown and the death of his family at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands of an out of Control Cyborg.</v>

137
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.313
<v Speaker 2>We lived a peaceful and happy life </v>
<v Speaker 2>together until that fateful day when a </v>

138
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 2>crazy cyborg went out of control and </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked our town.</v>

139
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>His experience mirrors that of many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other characters in the genre.</v>

140
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Gods from Berzerk Aaron from attack on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Titan Naruto.</v>

141
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 2>A painful childhood is a common </v>
<v Speaker 2>denominator throughout anime,</v>

142
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.203
<v Speaker 2>Manga and comics in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did these experiences shape the </v>

143
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 2>characters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:15.704
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty complex and often a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck on one hand their struggles </v>

145
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:20.354
<v Speaker 2>motivate them or at the very least seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give them the strength to withstand </v>

146
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>extremely difficult circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychology backs this up.</v>

147
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.673
<v Speaker 2>A growing body of research suggests that</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people who go through adverse or </v>

148
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:31.694
<v Speaker 2>traumatic experiences as kids are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ways more resilient than those </v>

149
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 2>whose childhoods were relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefree.</v>

150
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.083
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some individuals who grow up in high </v>

151
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.274
<v Speaker 2>stress environments develop unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem solving skills and are better </v>

152
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 2>able to deal with uncertainty and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>peers who had it easier.</v>

153
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.143
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't change the fact that there </v>

154
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:49.544
<v Speaker 2>are loads of other issues associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with having a rough childhood like </v>

155
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.174
<v Speaker 2>problems with learning and memory and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>propensity for being emotionally </v>

156
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 2>reactive and there are caveats to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole what doesn't kill you,</v>

157
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 2>makes you stronger idea to research on </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults has indicated that those who face</v>

158
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:03.824
<v Speaker 2>the medium number of challenging life </v>
<v Speaker 2>events like the death of a loved one or </v>

159
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:07.664
<v Speaker 2>financial difficulties or better able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cope with worry and stress than those </v>

160
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:11.204
<v Speaker 2>who deal with either an unusually low or</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unusually high number of such </v>

161
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

162
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 2>It sort of like the goldilocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle.</v>

163
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Optimal adaptation distress is achieved </v>
<v Speaker 2>from not having too much exposure,</v>

164
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 2>but not too little either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In theory,</v>

165
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.163
<v Speaker 2>general says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic experiences may have boosted </v>

166
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 2>his ability to handle the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiplash of hero work.</v>

167
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 2>There'll being a cyborg definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps.</v>

168
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 2>He fights to near death in battle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows up when others don't like when the</v>

169
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:36.254
<v Speaker 2>s class heroes are called in to hold off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media that threatens to wipe out </v>

170
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 2>cities eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

171
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.393
<v Speaker 2>Cytoma meanders through life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't even try to swat a mosquito </v>

172
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 2>without losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Additionally,</v>

173
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>having something to strive for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming is powerful.</v>

174
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 2>SSNC gives genesis work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning a stark contrast with Cytoma who</v>

175
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>was already at the top of his game.</v>

176
00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I'd always dreamed of becoming some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

177
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.503
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does my heart feel so lifeless and </v>

178
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:06.710
<v Speaker 4>empty?</v>

179
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.543
<v Speaker 2>What site to be more satisfied if he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>something more meaningful to work </v>

180
00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:11.690
<v Speaker 2>towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then some bs,</v>

181
00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:12.524
<v Speaker 2>superhero classification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's the purpose of having a </v>

182
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 2>purpose anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there some kind of biological benefit</v>

183
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.540
<v Speaker 2>to leading a meaningful life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back in 2008,</v>

184
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.530
<v Speaker 2>team of researchers published a study on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese concept of picky guy,</v>

185
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.040
<v Speaker 2>which roughly translates to a reason for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in it.</v>

186
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.980
<v Speaker 2>They asked 43,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a simple question,</v>

187
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.030
<v Speaker 2>do you have achy guide in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the end of the seven year long study,</v>

188
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.960
<v Speaker 2>roughly 95 percent of those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporting having a sense of icky guy,</v>

189
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:43.130
<v Speaker 2>we're still alive compared to only 83 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of those who said they did not,</v>

190
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.120
<v Speaker 2>regardless of socioeconomic status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological factors,</v>

191
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or history of illness,</v>

192
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.813
<v Speaker 2>the increased mortality risk remained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of those who died without a sense </v>

193
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:55.130
<v Speaker 2>that they could guide did so as a result</v>
<v Speaker 2>of heart disease,</v>

194
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.053
<v Speaker 2>mainly strokes for context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A link between heart disease and a lack </v>

195
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>of purpose has shown up consistently in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other studies.</v>

198
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:07.784
<v Speaker 2>sense of meaning in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike the villains in the series who </v>

199
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:13.310
<v Speaker 2>often have rather legitimate reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to destroy humanity</v>

200
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.410
<v Speaker 4>in order to wipe out humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Medieval civilization surface given bond</v>

201
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Cytoma</v>

202
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.290
<v Speaker 2>is still unsure of is icky guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you even have purpose when you've</v>

203
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.020
<v Speaker 2>achieved what people like Genos can only</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream of is aimless existence,</v>

204
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 2>leaves him prone to depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irritability,</v>

205
00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:33.104
<v Speaker 2>and melancholy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fluoros has struggled to find his icky </v>

206
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:39.050
<v Speaker 2>guy to his purpose in life was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy one world after the next what?</v>

207
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:42.320
<v Speaker 2>After growing so strong that he no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer had worthy adversaries,</v>

208
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.260
<v Speaker 2>he found himself board and apathetic a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

209
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:48.740
<v Speaker 2>told him he could find the opponent that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would reignite his passion for battle,</v>

210
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 2>so he's been traveling for 20 years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find one when he encounters cytoma.</v>

211
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.593
<v Speaker 2>In a sense sight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tma Is [inaudible] ag guy and give </v>

212
00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:57.524
<v Speaker 2>stimulation to my existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists for years have postulated a </v>

213
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:04.100
<v Speaker 2>relationship between purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life satisfaction and resilience.</v>

214
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Back in 1946,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>

215
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Viktor Frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychiatrist,</v>

216
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.653
<v Speaker 2>neurologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Holocaust survivor suggested that </v>

217
00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:12.650
<v Speaker 2>the societal ills of aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>

218
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:13.484
<v Speaker 2>and depression stemmed from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential vacuum or the idea that </v>

219
00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:19.550
<v Speaker 2>one's life and work much purpose in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

220
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Man's search for meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He describes the psychological impact of</v>

221
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:23.834
<v Speaker 2>daily life in a Nazi concentration camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows that the prisoners who clung </v>

222
00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:28.004
<v Speaker 2>onto a sense of purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the ones most likely to survive </v>

223
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.320
<v Speaker 2>writing life has never made unbearable </v>
<v Speaker 2>by circumstances,</v>

224
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.620
<v Speaker 2>but only by lack of meaning and purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>

225
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.513
<v Speaker 2>we've seen over and over again that </v>
<v Speaker 2>having no sense of meaning in life is </v>

226
00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.620
<v Speaker 2>associated with a higher risk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>

227
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the flip side,</v>

228
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Speaker 2>having a sense of purpose is associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lower incidents of these issues.</v>

229
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.113
<v Speaker 2>If challenging one's self is key to </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding purpose in life and having sort </v>

230
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.244
<v Speaker 2>of purpose is necessary for optimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological and perhaps even physical </v>

231
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.234
<v Speaker 2>health can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see why having virtually no </v>

232
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:00.424
<v Speaker 2>competition leave site to a miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging ourselves can help us find </v>

233
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 2>that meaning and improves our wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in other ways too,</v>

234
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.353
<v Speaker 2>and in some cases even the hardships we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't control can make us more </v>

235
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:10.954
<v Speaker 2>resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which suggests there might be a </v>

236
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>psychological benefit to seeing them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity for growth.</v>

237
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 2>So we'll cite them to ever be presented </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a real challenge.</v>

238
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.053
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if taking out this guy will </v>
<v Speaker 2>count as work and if he does will it </v>

239
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 2>gives him a much needed sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>passion.</v>

240
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Speaker 2>We'll just have to wait until season two</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever that is to find out and just to</v>

241
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>make sure you're being challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put my money where my mouth</v>

<v Speaker 2>one of which is poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You alternate turns with an opponent and</v>

245
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:42.064
<v Speaker 2>during each turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current player must choose whether </v>

246
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 2>to eat one or two of the remaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolates.</v>

247
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 2>The player who eats the poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate uses.</v>

248
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.103
<v Speaker 2>If you're the first player,</v>
