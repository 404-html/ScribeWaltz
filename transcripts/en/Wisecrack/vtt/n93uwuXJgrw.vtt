<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared here.</v>

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>As you grow older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to learn some hard truths.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Santa isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serial makes you fat.</v>

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Space Jam is a bad movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural and inevitable course,</v>

7
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I'm here to bury your </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood completely.</v>

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.933
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your childhoods last happy gasps of </v>

9
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>excitement will be drowned out by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plump,</v>

10
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>plump up dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly encasing it.</v>

11
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.343
<v Speaker 1>So get ready to become a hardened </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic with three mortgages and an </v>

12
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:36.764
<v Speaker 1>angry ex wife because I'm here to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that the lion king is actually </v>

13
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>cinemas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cutest advocacy of totalitarian ethics.</v>

14
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.863
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wise crack condition on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion king and as always spoilers ahead </v>

15
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:48.974
<v Speaker 1>but seriously wasn't seen as the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the lion king is one of the most </v>

16
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:52.304
<v Speaker 1>beloved films of the Disney Cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Animal Kingdoms political landscape </v>

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>also happens to be eerily similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the worst ideologies of not only</v>

18
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but arguably of all time.</v>

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>The Lion King tells the story of Simba a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young lion or Dane to succeed his father</v>

20
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.014
<v Speaker 1>move Fossa as king of the pride lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa teaches his young son all about </v>

21
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:13.664
<v Speaker 1>proper rulership and the delicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance of nature that a king must </v>

22
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>uphold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

23
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa as brothers scar covets the </v>
<v Speaker 1>throne gets moved,</v>

24
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.713
<v Speaker 1>Fossa killed and convinces the young </v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba that it's all his fault before </v>

25
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:28.184
<v Speaker 1>claiming the throne for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some lives out his shame with some </v>

26
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:31.454
<v Speaker 1>carefree hippies before returning to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride land to reclaim his rightful </v>

27
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>throne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

28
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 1>it's based on hamlet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the lion king,</v>

29
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>we're just the story of a king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his prints and a jealous brother.</v>

30
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be much to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't just that.</v>

31
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.593
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film posits two principles which </v>

32
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:47.024
<v Speaker 1>have been justifying the world's worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate since before despots even </v>

33
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:51.074
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is seemingly the most </v>

34
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:53.684
<v Speaker 1>wholesome at the beautiful balance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is the basis for politics or as </v>

35
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:57.914
<v Speaker 1>the film memorably calls it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film's famous opening number </v>

36
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>displays the majestic nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>African Savanna and the glorious natural</v>

37
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.264
<v Speaker 1>order of things we Fossa establishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pride rock is run on basic natural </v>

38
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>tenants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything the light touches is all</v>

39
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.993
<v Speaker 1>a king's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As ruler rises and falls like the sun </v>

40
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.223
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky opens up and shines a halo over </v>

41
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:26.984
<v Speaker 1>move fosters newborn son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heavens literally marking the lions </v>

42
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:30.374
<v Speaker 1>as the rightful natural rulers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The imagery couldn't be any clearer if </v>

43
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>they tacked on a Kyron stating obey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move Fossa.</v>

44
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.213
<v Speaker 1>And while you may wonder what it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a society that is ruled by someone </v>

45
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>like a lion who eats his subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

46
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>The circle of life is beautiful.</v>

47
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me explain.</v>

48
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.503
<v Speaker 2>When we die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our bodies become the grass and the </v>

49
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:53.804
<v Speaker 2>antelope eat the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we owe connected in the great </v>

50
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 2>circle of life,</v>

51
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>even though to be more scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate,</v>

52
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely that for the antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they're fully digested.</v>

53
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:07.924
<v Speaker 1>Brothers and sisters will be excreted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likes of Simba to fertilize the </v>

54
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they'll eat.</v>

55
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's like cannibalism with extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>

56
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.593
<v Speaker 1>And while it seems like a message that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even an environmentalist could get on </v>

57
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>board with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets dark.</v>

58
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.083
<v Speaker 1>All the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants and giraffes seem to happily </v>

59
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>accept their place in society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hailing the birth of a creature that may</v>

60
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.504
<v Speaker 1>very well eat them one day even move is </v>
<v Speaker 1>faithful servant quickly gets over the </v>

61
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>fact that he's assaulted and humiliated </v>
<v Speaker 1>as prey because well,</v>

62
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>he is praying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone is happy with their lot</v>

63
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hyenas are at the bottom of the food</v>

64
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably because they're scavengers.</v>

65
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we're dangling at the bottom of</v>

66
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that hyenas aren't welcome in</v>

67
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>pride rock.</v>

68
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>So they'd been relegated to starve in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant graveyard.</v>

69
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.583
<v Speaker 1>So that's principle one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a natural order to things </v>

70
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.004
<v Speaker 1>that must be adhered to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who are at the bottom of the food </v>

71
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>chain must accept their place for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater good.</v>

72
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>This whole vision of rulership as </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining harmony is not new.</v>

73
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.873
<v Speaker 1>It was advocated by Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to philosopher Karl </v>

74
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Popper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as k pop,</v>

75
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

76
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:14.584
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happened in western history </v>

77
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popper calls this general framework,</v>

78
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.933
<v Speaker 1>whole Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the whole of a society is </v>

79
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.904
<v Speaker 1>more important than the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's good for society is usually </v>

80
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>defined by some in controvertible law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be natural order,</v>

81
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>racial purity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the laws of history.</v>

82
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.763
<v Speaker 1>Popper explains that for Plato to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's place is a virtue and popper goes </v>

83
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:37.684
<v Speaker 1>on to explain that in this view of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and individual's goal is to be a </v>

84
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>perfectly crafted cog in the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>clockwork of societal.</v>

85
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Different cogs will have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles,</v>

86
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.284
<v Speaker 1>but the virtue of keeping one's place </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be common to all of them and it </v>

87
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>will the same time be the virtue of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

88
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.433
<v Speaker 1>That of being properly fitted together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being in harmony to this universal </v>

89
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato gives the name,</v>

90
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

91
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

92
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

93
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.933
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This theory of justice popper argues is </v>

94
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:06.754
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a nutshell if the individual is </v>

95
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:10.234
<v Speaker 1>simply a cog than ethics is nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make them fit there and to get </v>

96
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>all historical popper pointed out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato,</v>

97
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>a dennison of Athens seem to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boner for Sparta,</v>

98
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.393
<v Speaker 1>which when you think about it is a cruel</v>
<v Speaker 1>eugenics driven military dictatorship </v>

99
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.983
<v Speaker 1>and for popper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato's politics have been ruining the </v>

100
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>world ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inspiring everyone from petty tyrants to</v>

101
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:32.134
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad totalitarian nightmares to break </v>

102
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>this harmony for plato would be chaos or</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specifically democracy.</v>

103
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.963
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

104
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.803
<v Speaker 1>Plato's whole view of democracy was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives the right to rule to those who </v>

105
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>have no business in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor,</v>

106
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.624
<v Speaker 1>the landless and the stupid sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone we'll call this scary principle </v>

107
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:52.984
<v Speaker 1>1.5</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it fits into the larger holism </v>

108
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:55.714
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democracy for Plato is a sort of catch </v>

109
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>22 where sure all the people are equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and free to do whatever they like,</v>

110
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>but because most people are self </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>

111
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.234
<v Speaker 1>dicks society will quickly collapse as </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone pursues their own shortsighted </v>

112
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>

113
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 3>There's no food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no water,</v>

114
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 3>it's dinner time or we ain't got no </v>
<v Speaker 3>stinking entrees.</v>

115
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.513
<v Speaker 1>In a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lower class grows bigger and more </v>

116
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:19.990
<v Speaker 1>emboldened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They break the law with impunity,</v>

117
00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:20.824
<v Speaker 1>run naked in the streets and then form </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own youtube channels or whatever </v>

118
00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now listen,</v>

119
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:26.314
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to say that we should all </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively worship at the altar of </v>

120
00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:32.170
<v Speaker 1>democracy and freak out whenever there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a well reasoned criticism of it.</v>

121
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not an infallible system.</v>

122
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks me in the eye.</v>

123
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.213
<v Speaker 2>I'm like</v>

124
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 1>beer with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm voting for him,</v>

125
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.643
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between reasonable </v>

126
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:46.330
<v Speaker 1>criticism and pro authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>

127
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Scar in the hyenas aren't exactly out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for democracy,</v>

128
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:51.130
<v Speaker 1>but they are out for equal footing.</v>

129
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>A new way in which lie on and Hyena come</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in our grapes,</v>

130
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.393
<v Speaker 1>been relegated to the pride lands </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of New Jersey where they're </v>

131
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.760
<v Speaker 1>doomed to star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being manipulated by scar.</v>

132
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:07.594
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to be king for his own ends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this mirrors the way as Plato </v>

133
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:11.854
<v Speaker 1>predicts democracy and never bubbly ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>in tyranny with demagogues making false </v>

134
00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:17.650
<v Speaker 1>promises to the poor and hungry.</v>

135
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't make hay strict quit on me.</v>

136
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Scar fully embodies plato's </v>
<v Speaker 1>quintessential tyrant per play.</v>

137
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Doh eight hybrids is the worst type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

138
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.173
<v Speaker 1>a man so consumed by his own lawless </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires that he will do anything to </v>

139
00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:38.190
<v Speaker 1>achieve them even murder.</v>

140
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.260
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 1>When you have tyrants who have not </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved internal harmony,</v>

142
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 1>they go d harmonizing everything around </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

143
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.760
<v Speaker 1>When scar takes control of pride rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some inexplicable reason,</v>

144
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 1>the rivers run dry and the bright lush </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride lands are reduced.</v>

145
00:07:57.301 --> 00:08:02.301
<v Speaker 1>Weight bearing gray wasteland and scar </v>
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to be the smart one and he's</v>

146
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.760
<v Speaker 1>absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the pride lands are suffering,</v>

147
00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 1>it's because scar has usurped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural order of things.</v>

148
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you dare question your natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot in life,</v>

149
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.683
<v Speaker 1>well you must be a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an argument that would be well </v>

150
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.610
<v Speaker 1>received in the halls of any monarchy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dictatorship.</v>

151
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>And to bring abundance back to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeland symbols,</v>

152
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.370
<v Speaker 1>ghost ad reminds him to restore the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural or</v>

153
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.790
<v Speaker 2>takes your place in the circle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rice</v>

154
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>and like magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once Simba sends the usurper scar to his</v>

155
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:31.184
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenating rains fall on the pride </v>

156
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>lands bringing abundance and prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again.</v>

157
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.710
<v Speaker 2>The second</v>

158
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.020
<v Speaker 1>more creepy principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film is spouses.</v>

159
00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Is One less associated with Plato and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more?</v>

160
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sociopath ever might makes right.</v>

161
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.843
<v Speaker 1>This dismal view of society holds that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all morality isn't governed reason or </v>

162
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:56.784
<v Speaker 1>the exchange of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but brute force and weirdly the film </v>

163
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 1>just seems to go right out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit it as hot as brains go.</v>

164
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I got the lion's share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to blue to strengths,</v>

165
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gene who scars.</v>

166
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence is connected to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>deceitful illness,</v>

167
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>whereas his brother strength is </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to his nobleness.</v>

168
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.733
<v Speaker 1>This view is a favorite of not only Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany but pretty much any country </v>

169
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>trying to invade this out if their </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker neighbors.</v>

170
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.453
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we successfully ruined your </v>

171
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>childhood or how have we gone straight </v>
