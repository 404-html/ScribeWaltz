00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that religion can't ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>be useful or inspire good things,</v>

2
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly can and has and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will,</v>

3
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a better than the alternative,</v>

4
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.643
<v Speaker 1>but there's a distinction we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize there's a distinction between </v>

5
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>something being true and so they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and every religion,</v>

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.133
<v Speaker 1>every benign religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every religion that's actually helping </v>

7
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>somebody sometimes could be functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a placebo.</v>

8
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.913
<v Speaker 1>it could be totally barren of content </v>
<v Speaker 1>and still useful in certain </v>

10
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.234
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't invent a religion right now </v>

11
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>which we know is not true and would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful if I could spread it to</v>

12
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>billions invented right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just this religion is,</v>

13
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principles are,</v>

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>do your best to love your neighbor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your family and every person you</v>

15
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.383
<v Speaker 1>encourage your children to study science</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mathematics to the best of their </v>

17
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.554
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>

18
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't do this,</v>

19
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you will be punished for eternity by 17 </v>
<v Speaker 1>demons after death.</v>

20
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.463
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt that if I could spread </v>

21
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>this to billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be a better religion than the</v>

22
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.354
<v Speaker 1>religions we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be better than Christianity and </v>

23
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Judaism and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have no suicide bombers.</v>

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.083
<v Speaker 1>What you would have is a generation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children bearing down on science and </v>

25
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>mathematics to the best of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities,</v>

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.103
<v Speaker 1>encouraged by their otherwise ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents all under the the compulsion of </v>

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>do this or else the 17 demons will </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture you for eternity.</v>

28
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Does this with the usefulness of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this.</v>

29
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would live in a much better world.</v>

30
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The usefulness of this.</v>

31
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Would this suggest for a moment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these 17 demons actually exist?</v>

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Would it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it provide a reason to believe in,</v>

33
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>in these 17 demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a not even slightly.</v>

34
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the divide here.</v>

35
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

36
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.823
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of an idea or the consoling </v>

37
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>nature of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>the idea that God has a plan for me or </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything happens for a reason,</v>

39
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:20.394
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that these are consoling is</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite distinct from whether there are </v>

40
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>good reasons to believe right.</v>
