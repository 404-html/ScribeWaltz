00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is cracked jared again?</v>

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.233
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about an insanely </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular Halloween horror series </v>

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed to make you barf up all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy corn.</v>

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.983
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the Emoji movie we're talking saw </v>

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.923
<v Speaker 1>since 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The torture porn he franchise has been </v>

9
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>locking up morally dubious characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of gruesome steel contraptions</v>

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>and inventing creative new places to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide the keys.</v>

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>The creepy puppet master of the saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>franchise is Jigsaw and boy does he love</v>

12
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:37.904
<v Speaker 1>playing games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by playing games we mean locking </v>

13
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>unconscious people inside Dank </v>
<v Speaker 1>warehouses and giving them 60 seconds to</v>

14
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>choose between certain death self </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutilation or if they're lucky,</v>

15
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>this embellishing a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people talk about saw,</v>

16
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>they tend to focus on jigsaws impressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>body counts,</v>

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.373
<v Speaker 1>but just as you can pick through a pit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of heroin syringes to find the hidden </v>

18
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:57.764
<v Speaker 1>key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sift through this villains </v>

19
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>deadly traps to find the grander meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his game.</v>

20
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Welcome this wisecrack edition on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of Saul,</v>

21
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.223
<v Speaker 1>and as always spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The philosophy of saw all comes down to </v>

22
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 1>jigsaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivation is torturous.</v>

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.723
<v Speaker 1>Games are opportunities for his victims </v>
<v Speaker 1>to repent for their sins and ostensibly </v>

24
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>to transform into better human beings.</v>

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>They survive his tests and the odds are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite ever in their favor.</v>

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>He believes they'll emerge with a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>found ability to appreciate life.</v>

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So basically if Tony Robbins had a baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Satan,</v>

28
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.383
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jigsaw embodies a kind of extremist </v>

29
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Christian morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get there,</v>

30
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>we first needed to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>headspace of John Kramer.</v>

31
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Alias the jigsaw killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time,</v>

32
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:50.454
<v Speaker 1>John was a perfectly nice civil engineer</v>
<v Speaker 1>who loved hanging out with his pregnant </v>

33
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jill,</v>

34
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>who owned a drug Rehab Clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one of Joel's tweaked out patients,</v>

35
00:01:58.281 --> 00:01:59.114
<v Speaker 1>Cecil Adam's robs her clinic </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally injuring Jill in the </v>

36
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She suffers a miscarriage and John Falls</v>

37
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.604
<v Speaker 1>into a deep depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A short while after he's diagnosed with </v>

38
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:08.814
<v Speaker 1>a brain tumor and terminal cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he plummets further into depression and </v>

39
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>its relationship with jill quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorates.</v>

40
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Girl boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy gets cold,</v>

42
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:24.751
<v Speaker 2>pregnant girl loses baby boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns into a serial killer</v>

43
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and instead of joining tinder or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

44
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Joe continues to entangle herself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her booze drama.</v>

45
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.063
<v Speaker 1>After an all around year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Tries to kill himself by driving </v>

46
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miraculously,</v>

47
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>he survived the crash and emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally sure of his new calling,</v>

48
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>dispensing morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one torture device at a time.</v>

49
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a moment that I decided to end my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

50
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>started me and my work and brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to it,</v>

51
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.523
<v Speaker 1>and I was determined to spend the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my days testing the fabric of human </v>

52
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:53.424
<v Speaker 1>nature as John cooked up a fresh coat of</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality to match his new mission in </v>

53
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:57.504
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to have been inspired by an </v>

54
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>unlikely source early Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

55
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's views on suffering.</v>

56
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.013
<v Speaker 1>According to early Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is good in everything he created is </v>

57
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.064
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody really questioned that until </v>

58
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>one day and an early Christian stubbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>his toe and discovered suffering and was</v>

59
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks,</v>

60
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>WTF God.</v>

61
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Once a bunch of Christian theologians </v>
<v Speaker 1>started stubbing their toes,</v>

62
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.273
<v Speaker 1>they realized they needed to rationalize</v>
<v Speaker 1>how an all good God could have created </v>

63
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.144
<v Speaker 1>such suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They theorized that suffering had to be </v>

64
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>the fault of no good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lousy humans.</v>

65
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.783
<v Speaker 1>Here's what they figured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Adam ate that apple from the tree </v>

66
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge does committing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original sin.</v>

67
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.763
<v Speaker 1>He's separated dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil humans from the pure perfect God </v>

68
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.693
<v Speaker 1>who apparently doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When humans eat a fresh healthy snack </v>

69
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.593
<v Speaker 1>from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sinful humans would need to suffer and </v>

70
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>repent if they wanted to be reunited </v>
<v Speaker 1>with God.</v>

71
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Suffering then is the result of our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>sins and an expression of the pain.</v>

72
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>We feel over our separation from God in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

73
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Traditional Christianity justified </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering as the fault of the sinner,</v>

74
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>not of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crisis averted.</v>

75
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.973
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jigsaw thinks his victims deserve the </v>

76
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.554
<v Speaker 1>suffering that they endure in his traps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He helpfully reminds each victim of the </v>

77
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>sins they've committed to get there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't hold back.</v>

78
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.950
<v Speaker 1>As Jigsaw sees at his victims are </v>
<v Speaker 1>enslaved by their past and morality,</v>

79
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.470
<v Speaker 1>not his industrial strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture devices.</v>

80
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.483
<v Speaker 1>Much like theologians believe humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been trapped by Adam and Eve's </v>

81
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.273
<v Speaker 1>original sin fittingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The saw series has a few atoms of its </v>

82
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:32.924
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In sophomore we learned that drug </v>

83
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cecil Adams,</v>

84
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.583
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for Jill's miscarriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His original sin is a catalyst for </v>

85
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:42.920
<v Speaker 1>John's transformation into jigsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Additionally,</v>

86
00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 1>in the first film Adam stand height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a photographer who spends his day spying</v>

87
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:49.430
<v Speaker 1>on people becomes one of jigsaws </v>
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>

88
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.413
<v Speaker 1>His professional quest for CD knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrors that of Adam's desire to eat </v>

89
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.004
<v Speaker 1>from the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Kramer's view on human suffering </v>

90
00:04:57.111 --> 00:05:00.230
<v Speaker 1>shares a similar origin story to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have early Christians,</v>

91
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 1>which hey could mean that watching some </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies qualifies as attending church.</v>

92
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.203
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Kramer also shares a common thread </v>

93
00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 1>with Christian theorist and father of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism,</v>

94
00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Soren Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who sees suffering as a critical part of</v>

95
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>personal and spiritual growth.</v>

96
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.943
<v Speaker 1>For context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like Kramer Kicker Guard had his </v>

97
00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>share of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a lifelong physical deformity.</v>

98
00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>He watched his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers and sisters die at a young age.</v>

99
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 1>It became totally convinced that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to die at age 33 light Kramer.</v>

100
00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:31.220
<v Speaker 1>He also broke up with the love of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

101
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.083
<v Speaker 1>his then fiance regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet continue to pine after her for the </v>

102
00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:35.714
<v Speaker 1>rest of his days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the two of them could have </v>

103
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:38.084
<v Speaker 1>shared stories over whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also both believe that suffering </v>

104
00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:41.684
<v Speaker 1>purifies the sufferer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaches them to appreciate life and </v>

105
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:46.910
<v Speaker 1>forces them to take responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their actions.</v>

106
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 1>You might prefer your life without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>generous dose of suffering,</v>

107
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.773
<v Speaker 1>but here are the guy out here regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that an individual must pass </v>

108
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>through three distinct phases to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>his or her true self.</v>

109
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aesthetic driven by central </v>

110
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>pleasures and lacking any morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seconds,</v>

111
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.893
<v Speaker 1>the ethical driven by morality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief in individual responsibility and </v>

112
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious driven by faith in God.</v>

113
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.333
<v Speaker 1>So how do you go from being a lowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk aesthete to an upstanding ethical </v>

114
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:14.721
<v Speaker 1>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

115
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:17.440
<v Speaker 1>you can always try out one of jigsaws </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture machines.</v>

116
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Kierkegaard,</v>

117
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>suffering is key to moving up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next stage of human development.</v>

118
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.643
<v Speaker 1>Here could guard was mostly talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about spiritual and existential </v>

119
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:27.764
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being caught in a torture device or </v>

120
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having people spoiled game of thrones</v>

121
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.763
<v Speaker 1>still jigsaws machines can be understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a test for each of his victims who </v>

122
00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.220
<v Speaker 1>are typically aesthetes driven by </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires for sex,</v>

123
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:42.120
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or money.</v>

124
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.283
<v Speaker 1>His testes present his victims with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical quandary that usually forced </v>

125
00:06:46.351 --> 00:06:47.184
<v Speaker 1>them to make a painful decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This matches the way cuter guard </v>

126
00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:53.340
<v Speaker 1>explains the journey from being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic to ethical being first,</v>

127
00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:57.030
<v Speaker 1>the ethical life makes the suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer even more than before.</v>

128
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.953
<v Speaker 1>Drawing him out of the frying pan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the fire so that he really has </v>

129
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 1>something to scream about and only then </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it help him,</v>

130
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 1>but how exactly does suffering help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>become more ethical?</v>

131
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.483
<v Speaker 1>According to Kierkegaard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering forces a human to reflect on </v>

132
00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:12.840
<v Speaker 1>their situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only to think,</v>

133
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks,</v>

134
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.430
<v Speaker 1>that moment of reflection summons the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first doubt,</v>

135
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.210
<v Speaker 1>which regard describes as the thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this happening to me?</v>

136
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Can it not be otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or to put more simply what's going on?</v>

137
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.113
<v Speaker 1>That little WTF moment generates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate desire to change your </v>

138
00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:33.924
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desire opens a person up to a character </v>

139
00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls ethical self.</v>

140
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:41.894
<v Speaker 1>Understanding suffering is growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing because it turns these single </v>

141
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>individual over to himself completely at</v>
<v Speaker 1>its most successful.</v>

142
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.900
<v Speaker 1>This suffering can force a person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>repent for past sins,</v>

143
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for his guilt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to seek his own survival,</v>

144
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but more on that later as you progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the ladder of development,</v>

145
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 1>a piece of your old false self dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like the old Taylor swift</v>

146
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.263
<v Speaker 1>because she's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judging from his own interpretation of </v>

147
00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:09.774
<v Speaker 1>his car crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Kramer agrees that a different </v>

148
00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 1>person crawled out of the wreckage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Kierkegaard,</v>

149
00:08:14.191 --> 00:08:15.024
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal of spiritual suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to completely kill off your flawed </v>

150
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.163
<v Speaker 1>false self in order to make room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your recreation it into a better truer </v>

151
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:23.154
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer demands this of his most fervent </v>

152
00:08:24.841 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 1>follower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda,</v>

153
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:28.350
<v Speaker 1>when she agrees to live by his ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

154
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.240
<v Speaker 2>every cell in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no turning back.</v>

155
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Amanda sits in a prayer like position </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening deeply.</v>

156
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Diehard Saul fans called is seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda's baptism,</v>

157
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.140
<v Speaker 1>which is fitting when you consider how </v>
<v Speaker 1>baptism relates to suffering,</v>

158
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.200
<v Speaker 1>just as Jesus rose from the dead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>redeem humanity.</v>

159
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are baptized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritually cleanse Christian tradition.</v>

160
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Also see suffering as a mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual cleansing.</v>

161
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Jigsaw frequently references this </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of rebirth,</v>

162
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.153
<v Speaker 1>whether he's chatting with his favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciple or welcoming a new victim into </v>

163
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>one of his traps.</v>

164
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.373
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to your rebirth tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you the opportunity to face your </v>

165
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.080
<v Speaker 2>upside.</v>

166
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.913
<v Speaker 1>Jigsaw even loses his kidnapping Virgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>v during a literal celebration of </v>

167
00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:25.040
<v Speaker 1>rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese New Year celebration because</v>

168
00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it's the year of the pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer even picks up his sweet trademark</v>

169
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:29.144
<v Speaker 1>pig mask at the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trigger guard and Jigsaw have a few </v>

170
00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:33.650
<v Speaker 1>other important ideas and common </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically.</v>

171
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:34.484
<v Speaker 1>They both value personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard writes that the first </v>

172
00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:41.750
<v Speaker 1>indispensable step of becoming a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>man isn't getting strange new body hair,</v>

173
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.170
<v Speaker 1>but by becoming a responsible individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>before God,</v>

174
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Kramer demands the same from his victim </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the key to taking </v>

175
00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:56.380
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a choice,</v>

176
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Kramer Spurs his victims into life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Affirming action</v>

177
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.633
<v Speaker 2>seems to me that two of your sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impending death is causing you to </v>

178
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.210
<v Speaker 2>forgive his sins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wipe the slate clean.</v>

179
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that you're willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

180
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.470
<v Speaker 2>When a life is at stake</v>

181
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.413
<v Speaker 1>in the moment of making a choice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick regard believed that a man becomes </v>

182
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

183
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Kramer is adamant that his victims </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose their actions even ending each of</v>

184
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:25.671
<v Speaker 1>his games with this Yoda like refrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also maintains that the individual is</v>

185
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:33.654
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the outcome of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision within the confines of the </v>

186
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never murdered anyone in my life.</v>

187
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:40.134
<v Speaker 1>The decisions are up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While many horror films offer an </v>

188
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.700
<v Speaker 1>ultimate salvation</v>

189
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.833
<v Speaker 1>saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not offer any kind of hope for a </v>

190
00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:50.330
<v Speaker 1>better tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

191
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:51.164
<v Speaker 1>it seems to critique this extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of traditional Christian </v>

192
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:54.614
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the series Kramer's </v>

193
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.180
<v Speaker 1>positioned as a god like figure monk or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even martyr,</v>

194
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.283
<v Speaker 1>he dresses in a long black hooded cape </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquires flocks of disciples and </v>

195
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:04.484
<v Speaker 1>performed baptisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also maintains the quality of </v>

196
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>omniscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always watching his victims through</v>

197
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:13.400
<v Speaker 1>camera monitors or people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so jigsaw may be a godlike figure,</v>

198
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:14.234
<v Speaker 1>but he's a seriously failed one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His attempt to establish a moral order </v>

199
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.430
<v Speaker 1>does not bring about meaningful change </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kramer professes.</v>

200
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.610
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For starters,</v>

201
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:23.444
<v Speaker 1>most of his victims failed their tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They crumble under pressure or can't </v>

202
00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:27.614
<v Speaker 1>withstand the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who do pass are frequently </v>

203
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:30.944
<v Speaker 1>traumatized.</v>

204
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.623
<v Speaker 2>You want to know the best thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me after having to cut off </v>

205
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:41.471
<v Speaker 2>my own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our handicap parking at the mall.</v>

206
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Further revealing the full extent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jigsaws failure is this ill fated quest </v>

207
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.024
<v Speaker 1>for the right apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of his contenders twists his </v>

208
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>philosophy while jigsaw creates games </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are truly winnable.</v>

209
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.933
<v Speaker 1>If you follow the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to preserve your life as </v>

210
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>long as you're willing to part with say </v>
<v Speaker 1>your left arm.</v>

211
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.543
<v Speaker 1>His mentees on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create rig games that are unwinnable </v>

212
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:04.204
<v Speaker 1>death traps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blowing up Jake's last game was to get </v>

213
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was the door well to his disciples?</v>

214
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Just used the games to get revenge on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people they don't like.</v>

215
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they all end up trapping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing one another.</v>

216
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy to them,</v>

217
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>the point of the Games is punishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than renewal.</v>

218
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.433
<v Speaker 1>So much for Jigsaw is legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The characters in the Sol films </v>

219
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 1>frequently remind the audience that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a seriously flawed moral code.</v>

220
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You said you wanted to talk then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said you wanted to play a game.</v>

221
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.453
<v Speaker 1>You're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means nothing just before her </v>

222
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Denounces Him.</v>

223
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lastly,</v>

224
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>because Jigsaw is presented as a god </v>
<v Speaker 1>like figure,</v>

225
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you would expect that his justice be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispensed fairly,</v>

226
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.333
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the villain of the series and his </v>

227
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 1>morality lessons frequently sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent human lives.</v>

228
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.603
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd expect his death to result in </v>

229
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:53.494
<v Speaker 1>salvation or redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead he dies after offering one </v>

230
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>of his victims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

231
00:12:57.011 --> 00:13:01.790
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to forgive him instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>get violently killed.</v>

232
00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:04.600
