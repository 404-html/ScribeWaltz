1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot season continues that wise crack.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.713
<v Speaker 1>This one is another format that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with real world issues rather </v>

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.194
<v Speaker 1>than focusing on media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another reason why we're excited </v>

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.774
<v Speaker 1>about this one is this is a continuation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a collaboration we've had going on </v>

5
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.374
<v Speaker 1>for a while and that is with an artist </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Jr who has been the illustrator </v>

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>for thug notes since the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did all the art for this.</v>

7
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>We're super excited to get it out into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Hope you guys enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know.</v>

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.573
<v Speaker 1>And on with the show in October of 1992 </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the worldwide web was just a few </v>

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.103
<v Speaker 1>years old and the idea of streaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>terabytes of pornography was just a far </v>

11
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:37.674
<v Speaker 1>fetched dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A presidential candidate had an </v>

12
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.383
<v Speaker 1>interesting idea.</v>

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I will have a unique mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to end the form,</v>

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.934
<v Speaker 2>the people in detail on the issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>through an electronic town hall so that </v>

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 2>they really know what's going on.</v>

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Perot wasn't talking about the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

17
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to use technology to </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionize democracy.</v>

18
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.503
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>televised town halls or debates could </v>

19
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>allow viewers to chime in with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

20
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Press one for agree to for disagree like</v>
<v Speaker 1>many others,</v>

21
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:07.414
<v Speaker 1>parole believe new technology could </v>
<v Speaker 1>break down barriers between decision </v>

22
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>makers and the average citizen.</v>

23
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Now all these phil is $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>suits and alligator shoes running up and</v>

24
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 2>down the halls of Congress that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

25
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lobbyists,</v>

26
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 2>the pack guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foreign lobbyist,</v>

27
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:21.344
<v Speaker 2>what have heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be over there in the </v>

28
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Smithsonian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.710
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't</v>

30
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.543
<v Speaker 1>the first to suggest this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic democracy and he won't leave </v>

31
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:31.444
<v Speaker 1>the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those who lamented the corporate </v>

32
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>controlled media or the limited flow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in authoritarian regimes,</v>

33
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>the Internet was a godsend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One wired article proudly announced that</v>

34
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>netizens we're better informed and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>civically engaged in they're unconnected</v>

35
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By 1997 emir,</v>

36
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.983
<v Speaker 1>8.5%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the population was considered </v>

37
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they voted more,</v>

38
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.963
<v Speaker 1>had greater trust in democracy and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to know basic information </v>

39
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 1>like who the chief justice is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

40
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>these connected citizens were a bastion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of light in the political ecosystem,</v>

41
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>but has this light dimmed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it ever there at all?</v>

42
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.493
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can now access unprecedented amounts </v>

43
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:16.270
<v Speaker 1>of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you've probably guessed,</v>

44
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.583
<v Speaker 1>something is wrong with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's fast forward to 2010 young people </v>

45
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 1>are doing exactly what futurists </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted,</v>

46
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.313
<v Speaker 1>connecting on twitter and coming out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets to protest oppressive </v>

47
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>regimes in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tunisia,</v>

48
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:31.504
<v Speaker 1>and elsewhere.</v>

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.220
<v Speaker 1>The media heralded the Arab spring as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first social media revolution,</v>

50
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>the promise of the Internet inaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the Internet,</v>

51
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 1>political organizing was risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business,</v>

52
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>stump speeches and flyer distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>were great ways to end up in jail.</v>

53
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.823
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the age of tweets heard round the </v>

54
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one can instigate change from the safety</v>

55
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>of one's own home until your movement is</v>
<v Speaker 1>too large to quell,</v>

56
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but despite the praise the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>earned for his in the Arab spring,</v>

57
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.383
<v Speaker 1>some have argued that the uprisings </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof that the internet can actually </v>

58
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>stifle politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

59
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.833
<v Speaker 1>Because in Egypt at least the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution didn't start until the </v>

60
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.424
<v Speaker 1>Internet went dark on January 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011 after several days of widespread </v>

61
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.084
<v Speaker 1>protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak </v>

62
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.620
<v Speaker 1>shutdown the country's internet like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

63
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.713
<v Speaker 1>cell phones too in anticipation of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been billed as the biggest of all </v>

64
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.633
<v Speaker 1>days of rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government completely shut down the </v>

65
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Internet in an attempt to stop people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from communicating.</v>

66
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.093
<v Speaker 1>One paper argued that the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet intensified revolutionary </v>

67
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.003
<v Speaker 1>unrest in three ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He angered those who were otherwise </v>

68
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.833
<v Speaker 1>unaware or uninterested in the unrest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It forced more face to face </v>

69
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>communication and it decentralized the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellion,</v>

70
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>making it even harder to put down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

71
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:59.761
<v Speaker 1>the Iranian revolution of 1978 and 1979 </v>
<v Speaker 1>took place only after a news blackout,</v>

72
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.043
<v Speaker 1>which raises another question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if exposure to information doesn't </v>

73
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>necessarily compel us to fix injustices </v>
<v Speaker 1>or clamor for a better world,</v>

74
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>but just makes us more content with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo?</v>

75
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>The author was inspired by another paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looked at East Germans living under</v>

76
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>communism who had access to Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

77
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I understand our gathering today as </v>
<v Speaker 3>being broadcast as well.</v>

78
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 3>In the east to those listening in East </v>
<v Speaker 3>Berlin a special word.</v>

79
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.153
<v Speaker 1>You might think that seeing a world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom would inspire the East Germans </v>

80
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>too to test their oppressive regime and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spur them to rebel,</v>

81
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.653
<v Speaker 1>but it did exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern Germans with access to western </v>

82
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:47.480
<v Speaker 1>TV found their life under communism more</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerable than their peers without it.</v>

83
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 1>TV offered an escape from food lines at </v>
<v Speaker 1>state propaganda.</v>

84
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Why fight for a better world when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just watch one?</v>

85
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.023
<v Speaker 1>Why jump over a shark on water skis if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just watch the funds do it and </v>

86
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 1>why participate in politics when you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>just retweet someone else's virtue.</v>

87
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 researchers looked at the saved </v>
<v Speaker 1>are for cause on facebook.</v>

88
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
<v Speaker 1>What they found at this point probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't surprise you.</v>

89
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.760
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of caused members </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruited no one else into the cause and</v>

90
00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:17.594
<v Speaker 1>contributed no money to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting facebook conjured and </v>

91
00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:25.040
<v Speaker 1>illusion of activism rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitating the real thing.</v>

92
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.593
<v Speaker 1>To be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are counter examples like the als </v>

93
00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:29.414
<v Speaker 1>ice bucket challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which raised unprecedented amounts of </v>

94
00:05:31.761 --> 00:05:32.594
<v Speaker 1>money to fight the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but entering a credit card number is a </v>

95
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:39.860
<v Speaker 1>lot different than being an engaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen where problems are a little more</v>

96
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.410
<v Speaker 1>complicated than dumping money into </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

97
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.993
<v Speaker 1>And what about our electronic town halls</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the promise that digital citizens </v>

98
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 1>will be more informed than previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

99
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.193
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 a pew research poll claimed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the Internet at least people </v>

100
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.233
<v Speaker 1>felt more informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what should we make of feeling more </v>

101
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>informed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

102
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.951
<v Speaker 1>as early as 1996 mit researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophetically declared that the internet</v>

103
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>ran the risk of becoming what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as a cyber Balkans,</v>

104
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>like the countries of the Balkan </v>
<v Speaker 1>peninsula,</v>

105
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>which became increasingly fragmented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile toward one another.</v>

106
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>The Internet would create insular </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities for its users.</v>

107
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.863
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they identified echo chambers 20 years </v>

108
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>before everyone freaked out about them.</v>

109
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>The point is access to information </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily dispel falsehoods.</v>

110
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>It can amplify them rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrediting flat earthers,</v>

111
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>anti-vaxxers and whatever the hell goop </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

112
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has helped them thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the rest of us.</v>

113
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Why challenge your own perspectives when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find sources that think like you</v>

114
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what gifts as one philosopher notes,</v>

115
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>as we produce more knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we gained in Brett,</v>

116
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.893
<v Speaker 1>we lose in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has an opinion but is never </v>

117
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>committed to act on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

118
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.313
<v Speaker 1>Because of what he considers to be two </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the worst calamities of the modern </v>

119
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:04.184
<v Speaker 1>era and an entity and the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this philosopher wasn't talking </v>

120
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:09.554
<v Speaker 1>about the internet or even the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>era because he died in 1855 what soren </v>

121
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 1>kierkegaard identified as problems in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 18 hundreds anonymity,</v>

122
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>public opinion and arm chair </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual wisdom have been given mega</v>

123
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.074
<v Speaker 1>steroids in the age of the Internet here</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard argued the press invited us to </v>

124
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>become detached spectators.</v>

125
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.763
<v Speaker 1>Divorcing thought from action ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>where homogenized as everyone began to </v>

126
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:35.654
<v Speaker 1>read the same sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we read the same and hit like and </v>

127
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>share if we agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no independent thought needed,</v>

128
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but before getting too cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we ask,</v>

129
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.843
<v Speaker 1>is this the fault of the Internet itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>or things on it like facebook or </v>

130
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Blowgun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

131
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.203
<v Speaker 1>there are tons of examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some studied and some not of the bright </v>

132
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>side of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>times for the Internet helped organize a</v>

133
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 1>community or connect old friends or let </v>
<v Speaker 1>people explore who they really are.</v>

134
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>But rather than looking at specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>

135
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.513
<v Speaker 1>it's important to understand the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet as a system with a supreme </v>

136
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 1>mandate to produce knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically knowledge about you,</v>

137
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>tailored for you and often produced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

138
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>The Internet isn't about what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is produced.</v>

139
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.383
<v Speaker 1>It's concerned with the ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerating exchange of information in </v>

140
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More photos,</v>

141
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>more kickstarters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more video watch time.</v>

142
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a system that cares about scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quality,</v>

143
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.683
<v Speaker 1>not integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And despite this ever increasing </v>

144
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 1>exchange of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet seems to generate isolation</v>

145
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 1>wherever it goes from early Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies that show users feel more lonely</v>

146
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>and depressed on a micro level to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>balkanization of our political landscape</v>

147
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.183
<v Speaker 1>on a macro level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Internet evangelists thought </v>

148
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>that access to information would connect</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like never before.</v>

149
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It's managed to do exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

150
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480
<v Speaker 1>at least there's this Bay Bay Bay,</v>

151
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 4>cause I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

152
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say,</v>

153

155
00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:55.460

156
00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 1>We've been working on it since about </v>
<v Speaker 1>February.</v>

157
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.610
<v Speaker 1>We actually cited 36 different sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the script work,</v>

158
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.613

<v Speaker 1>able to do video experiments like this </v>
