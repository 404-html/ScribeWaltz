00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.183
<v Speaker 1>I believe that I have a very loud voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not ashamed or embarrassed or </v>

2
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>shying away from expressing what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

3
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to like everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My website's called Perez Hilton Dot </v>

4
00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not called the New York Times.</v>

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to feign of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the entertainment industry.</v>

6
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't still be in it and I wouldn't</v>

7
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>have chosen that topic for my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first started blogging,</v>

8
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to Los Angeles in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be an actor,</v>

9
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but like nine out of 10 people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Los Angeles,</v>

10
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work for me and I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>thankful because I'm so much happier now</v>

11
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.723
<v Speaker 1>doing what I do then if I would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been an actor that was struggling to </v>

12
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>work or even if I did get some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

13
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I love being my own boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love calling the shots and I love what</v>

14
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel really lucky.</v>

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>My perspective on fame hasn't changed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all because I'm still normal.</v>

16
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm a normal person and I do normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

17
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I haven't let fame affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>which sometimes people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can buy into their own hype.</v>

19
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that I have an alter </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego helps and I think the fact that for </v>

20
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:39.504
<v Speaker 1>every two people that like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably four point five that </v>

21
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also helps too.</v>

22
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that I'm hot shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a big head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:53.754
<v Speaker 1>I already do have a big head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have as big a head as I </v>

25
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:56.124
<v Speaker 1>could have.</v>
