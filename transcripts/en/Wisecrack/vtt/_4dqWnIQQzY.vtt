1
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Conventional wisdom or has had at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no teper source of electricity,</v>

2
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>then call and impact the have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable suffers.</v>

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.033
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason we have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system is because environmental </v>

4
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.871
<v Speaker 1>as have generally pushed when power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the world tykes which can be a small</v>

5
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

6
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

7
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.881
<v Speaker 1>maybe even 20% of our electricity supply</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes them huge markets.</v>

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>But 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

9
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>20% of our supply is not a climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change solution.</v>

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>There are great investment opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we invest in them,</v>

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.053
<v Speaker 1>but we have to be clear they want solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the climate change problem for that you </v>

12
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>need something that can have the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliability,</v>

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>independent ability call has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sign a 20 year contract with the</v>

14
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.384
<v Speaker 1>utility and say something other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ship your power when the wind </v>

15
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>blows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't quite work for utility.</v>

16
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.913
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are newer technologies coming </v>

17
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>along that solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your terminal solves that problem.</v>

18
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.204
<v Speaker 1>You can deliver power when the utility </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs new kinds of technologies like </v>

19
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>solar thermal and Florida just </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced,</v>

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of those technologies for a </v>

21
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.224
<v Speaker 1>massive solar project in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not considered a traditional solar </v>

22
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:27.804
<v Speaker 1>strength state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These technologies can have what's </v>

23
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>called dispatchable power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the utilities customers need power,</v>

24
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>you can supply it to the utility so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can supply it to their customers and not</v>

25
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>make excuses like it's not sunny or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wind doesn't blow.</v>

26
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of utility grade power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

27
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I call it punk power is absolutely key </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cracking call.</v>

28
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be cheap enough.</v>

29
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.553
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of coal based power has been </v>

30
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.284
<v Speaker 1>going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Environmental Regulations for criteria </v>

31
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.704
<v Speaker 1>pollutants like sulfur dioxide in mode </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating have been getting more </v>

32
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:05.514
<v Speaker 1>stringent.</v>

33
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.803
<v Speaker 1>And because of that call now it costs </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot more to preger coal based </v>

34
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:11.874
<v Speaker 1>power costs a lot more to produce than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it did five years ago or even two years </v>

35
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.103
<v Speaker 1>that gives us an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coal industry is talking about next </v>

37
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:22.944
<v Speaker 1>generation coal power plant technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>called IGCC and IGCC carbon </v>

38
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>sequestration is what they think is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

39
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>The so called clean called switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That solution should be attempted.</v>

40
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.273
<v Speaker 1>We should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My personal belief is solar thermal </v>

41
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>technologies and geothermal technologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be cheaper than those technologies.</v>

42
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And because they will be cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll beat them in the marketplace.</v>

43
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that we don't need as much coal for </v>
<v Speaker 1>power generation.</v>

46
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>There are other good uses for calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not against cove,</v>

47
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't end up in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere first.</v>

48
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe having watched technology </v>

49
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>development over the last three to five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.043
<v Speaker 1>that could a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problem is having people </v>

51
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:20.731
<v Speaker 1>believe that we can replace oil with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper alternative.</v>

52
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.403
<v Speaker 1>That we can replace IGCC corn plants </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a cheaper source of power that are </v>

53
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>more renewable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% renewable.</v>

54
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Having the world believe that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest problem.</v>

55
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>We still need to make more progress in </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

56
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.840
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe it's a mostly solved </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
