00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise crack jared again.</v>

5
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.014
<v Speaker 1>And today we're looking at the candy </v>
<v Speaker 1>flavored fever dream that is adventure </v>

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>time with Finn and Jake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in their final season of adventures,</v>

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>we want it to look at what makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show so special.</v>

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And while there are lots of reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>people love adventure time,</v>

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to argue it has a lot to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a storytelling style as old as </v>

10
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>written storytelling itself and an epic </v>
<v Speaker 1>to epic for most to finish d elliot.</v>

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how adventure time tells a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

12
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And as always spoilers ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

13
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:40.374
<v Speaker 1>some of the similarities to the classics</v>
<v Speaker 1>of old come down to the Ed venturing </v>

14
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The classics have monsters,</v>

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>dramatic rescues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long journeys to Distinct Kingdoms and a</v>

16
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>beautiful princess that sends soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to battle.</v>

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.953
<v Speaker 1>The Elliot is also sometimes referred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the song of helium and is written in </v>

18
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>verse giving it strong links to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>

19
00:00:58.801 --> 00:00:59.634
<v Speaker 1>adventure time features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of music and songs throughout at </v>

20
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>seasons.</v>

21
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pancakes making big and pancakes takes a</v>

22
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 2>big enough to put it in a cake.</v>

23
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And characters even occasionally speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>in rhyme.</v>

24
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I've caught thumb thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my whole show,</v>

25
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>don't you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Might Stub your toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Elliot and adventure time.</v>

27
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Also both start with a musical call to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear their story.</v>

28
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.063
<v Speaker 3>Thanks your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grab your friends to fairy dust and </v>

29
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.913
<v Speaker 3>lands right.</v>

30
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>But what really connects adventure time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with epics like the Iliad,</v>

31
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the Odyssey or the alien is a surprising</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

32
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>The structure of poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rebecca sugar,</v>

33
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>former adventure time writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one set of show Creator Pendleton Ward.</v>

34
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>He's expressing thoughts about very </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern feelings that people have.</v>

35
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.223
<v Speaker 1>Good poetry is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the things that venture time is </v>

36
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:48.644
<v Speaker 1>known for have origins in poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mix of modern and classical </v>

37
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:52.514
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

38
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>

39
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 3>you fun to do.</v>

40
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.303
<v Speaker 1>It's music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's use of colorful and evocative </v>

41
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The invention of new words,</v>

42
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>objects and creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

43
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drama bomb and just how plain surreal at</v>

44
00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:10.234
<v Speaker 1>all is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the most telling ways it </v>

45
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.274
<v Speaker 1>relates to poetry is in its length </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure times episodes only last </v>

46
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>roughly 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half your average TV show,</v>

47
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 1>which means each episode relies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>compression.</v>

48
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear any story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been compressed.</v>

49
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It jettisons the boring details for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting stuff,</v>

50
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.563
<v Speaker 1>classical poetry and a lot of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry to hustle pre from rules on how </v>

51
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Speaker 1>this compression is achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Elliot,</v>

52
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:35.314
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compresses each line in toy form of </v>

53
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>poetic rhythm or meter called Deck Tilak</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heck Salmon,</v>

54
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>which is a fancy way of saying each line</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be exactly 18 silk.</v>

55
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Almost all poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it doesn't use meter,</v>

56
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>is a mode of compression and sure movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed stories to a few hours.</v>

57
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>TV compresses them to under an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but adventure time is even more hardcore</v>

58
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>compressing a whole story in to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

59
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.973
<v Speaker 1>This type of stripping down requires the</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential elements be focused on in </v>

60
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.544
<v Speaker 1>imaginative ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the episode [inaudible] Fin lives an </v>

61
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>entire lifetime in a pillow dimension or</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets married,</v>

62
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>has kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grows old all in 10 minutes.</v>

63
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.723
<v Speaker 1>This economy of exposition shows how </v>
<v Speaker 1>compression feeds creativity and helps </v>

64
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.781
<v Speaker 1>focus the story and unlike other stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>that get compressed in infuriating ways.</v>

65
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Game of thrones season seven venture </v>
<v Speaker 1>time uses this compression to be more </v>

66
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.244
<v Speaker 1>outlandish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first shot of boy features raining </v>

67
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:30.484
<v Speaker 1>knives outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows us why the characters are </v>

68
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>stuck indoors within the first second </v>
<v Speaker 1>without having to tell us,</v>

69
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but aside from just both poems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure time are short.</v>

70
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>We can also draw similarities between </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they use these narratives.</v>

71
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Snippets to tell a larger story.</v>

72
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally in an epic poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iliad,</v>

73
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>the text is broken up into paragraphs </v>
<v Speaker 1>called stanzas.</v>

74
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Stanzas composed larger chapters called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cantos from the Italian word for song.</v>

75
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You could see a season of a TV show as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>canto and an episode as a stanza.</v>

76
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>The stands focuses on the individual and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feelings,</v>

77
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.993
<v Speaker 1>a short vignette or seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives an insight into someone's </v>

78
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>character even if it lasts a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the [inaudible] episode.</v>

79
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>It Canto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand is the accumulation of</v>

80
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.474
<v Speaker 1>the scenes that tell the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>several characters or a whole world in </v>

81
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Dante's inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another epic poem,</v>

82
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>the stands that will be a short </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction or description,</v>

83
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but the canto will be the story of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole circle of hell.</v>

84
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.523
<v Speaker 1>Just like the Elliot and other epics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adventure time tells it stories on a </v>

85
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:30.004
<v Speaker 1>micro and macro level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are there the contain </v>

86
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:33.514
<v Speaker 1>narratives of each episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an overall narrative that reflects </v>

87
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the history of the land of uz through </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>

88
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even just certain names.</v>

89
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>We discover the different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and rulers.</v>

90
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Who Has Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

91
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.523
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the main deity is a cosmic owl and </v>

92
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>especially from the episode Simon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcy,</v>

93
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>it's hinted that ou was formed after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear apocalypse.</v>

94
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.223
<v Speaker 1>One of the most interesting ways in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which adventure time can be compared to </v>

95
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.404
<v Speaker 1>poetry is with something called Bathos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bathos is a sort of anticlimax a sudden </v>

96
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>shift in tone or thoroughly mediocre and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a suspenseful moment.</v>

97
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.963
<v Speaker 1>There are some great examples of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the classics like the defeat of </v>

98
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:17.311
<v Speaker 1>Achilles and invincible warrior brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>down by the Lamest of weaknesses is heel</v>

99
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.813
<v Speaker 1>and in paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learned that divine angels defecate </v>

100
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.593
<v Speaker 1>not through their poop shoots but from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of missed from their skin that is </v>

101
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>bathos something built up then brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashing down to earth.</v>

102
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.403
<v Speaker 1>Adventure time is full of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just when something gets too dangerous </v>

103
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>or scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have come for you or romantic,</v>

104
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>kiss me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thin Amin,</v>

105
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.770
<v Speaker 1>kiss me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's either interrupted or undercut</v>

106
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>by another character undermining it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it off.</v>

107
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>busy crossing you,</v>

108
00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:01.120
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

109
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Speaker 4>he's just hugging me gently.</v>

110
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venture time is not the only show to use</v>

111
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those for the sake of humor,</v>

112
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.630
<v Speaker 5>how things are going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

113
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 5>easy here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

114
00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 5>child things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll get pride.</v>

115
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.333
<v Speaker 1>It certainly helps make some of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy moments palatable to a younger </v>

116
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth,</v>

117
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.123
<v Speaker 1>this is also often integral to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling and the moral message of </v>

118
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters.</v>

119
00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:27.004
<v Speaker 1>Usually villains are introduced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispensed with in an episode and even </v>

120
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.100
<v Speaker 1>longstanding ones like the ice king </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop using bathos.</v>

121
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I was going to start up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical again,</v>

122
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:37.060
<v Speaker 1>but I got depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.013
<v Speaker 1>One of the key lessons you learned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure time is prejudice is bad or </v>

124
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:43.390
<v Speaker 1>the more cliched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't judge a book by its cover.</v>

125
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.493
<v Speaker 1>This is accomplished by setting up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>villain as evil and then finding out </v>

126
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>they're simply misunderstood as is.</v>

127
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm hot again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks</v>

128
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>dunes or a good guy who was a villain </v>
<v Speaker 1>all along.</v>

129
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>This type of bathetic technique is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently in poetry,</v>

130
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>both from antiquity and today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is also a linchpin for character arcs</v>

131
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:06.120
<v Speaker 1>and adventure time and an integral part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how it tells its story.</v>

132
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Although some sea adventure time as </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime TV for stoners,</v>

133
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I am the dream warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have summoned you here to hang with me</v>

134
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and you're together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dream.</v>

135
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to show us a move to beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the farm?</v>

136
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a fierce fandom out there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have invested a lot of time interpreting</v>

137
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather fake narrative.</v>

138
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.063
<v Speaker 1>The same can also be set up poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can oftentimes seem intentionally </v>

139
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:27.024
<v Speaker 1>cryptic end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though poetry isn't as cool as </v>

140
00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:32.220
<v Speaker 1>whoever this Jake Paul Dude is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adventure time is a prime example of how</v>

141
00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 1>millennia old poetic techniques are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still being used to tell funny,</v>

142
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:36.954
<v Speaker 1>sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and downright weird stories and two </v>

143
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.620
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary effect.</v>
