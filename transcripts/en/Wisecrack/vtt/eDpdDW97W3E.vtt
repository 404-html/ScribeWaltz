00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>What's up guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paddling season continues out wise </v>

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:03.534
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So last month we piled it a show called </v>

3
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the film tourist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on the wolf of Wall Street.</v>

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen that one yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sure to check it out.</v>

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>This is the second episode in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

6
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>This one is on the shining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we get to it,</v>

7
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.034
<v Speaker 1>this video is sponsored by movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>crack and along with the show Stanley </v>

10
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.723
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shining or the world's most </v>

11
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 1>persuasive argument for taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs.</v>

12
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>This movie scares the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

13
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but why all this for you there</v>

14
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is wrong with this place is</v>

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>haunted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it all in their heads?</v>

16
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Is it possessed by the Devil Tony?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about an Indian burial ground.</v>

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>They located on an Indian burial ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where else?</v>

18
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.094
<v Speaker 1>A lot of traditional horror gives us an </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to understand reason to shirt dark </v>

19
00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:05.224
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shining deliberately avoids an </v>

20
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.723
<v Speaker 1>easily describable premise and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what makes it so damn </v>

21
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It deprives us of logical explanation.</v>

22
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Koop rick accomplishes this in a variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways,</v>

23
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:18.554
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here at the overlook hotel to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about one of the most surprisingly </v>

24
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>simple perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most effective ways to create</v>

25
00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:27.464
<v Speaker 1>a stronger sense of perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the way it's shot is framed and </v>

26
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>sequenced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

27
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>a shot can be objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective,</v>

28
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>or fall somewhere in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purely objective shots.</v>

29
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Show us a scene as it is a God's eye </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view as a poor eavesdropping or</v>

30
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.474
<v Speaker 1>watching a play.</v>

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.733
<v Speaker 1>Subjective ankles directly insert us </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the action showing the view from </v>

32
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>just beside or behind a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purely subjective shots take us directly</v>

33
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:55.844
<v Speaker 1>into the eyes of a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually by showing their face first </v>

34
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.653
<v Speaker 1>followed by their visual perspective or </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional experience can also invite us </v>

35
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>to question what we're seeing like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreliable narrator in literature.</v>

36
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>In this scene we see a shot up Danny's </v>
<v Speaker 1>face that a cut to the girls.</v>

37
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Then Danny's face again with this simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of shots were being shown.</v>

38
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>The events through Danny's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how cooper it takes this basic</v>

39
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>principle perspective to create an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indescribable supernatural feeling.</v>

40
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.953
<v Speaker 1>Consider the famous scene of Danny </v>
<v Speaker 1>riding his tricycle through the hotel's </v>

41
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>winding corridors and you give me some </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

42
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.353
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using a state of the art piece of </v>

43
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:38.804
<v Speaker 1>equipment for the time who brick is able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve supernaturally smooth </v>

44
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:42.644
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To follow Danny showing us the hotel </v>

45
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:45.194
<v Speaker 1>from a child's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We followed danny any traditional </v>

46
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:48.914
<v Speaker 1>subjective shot that emphasizes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience navigating a large maze like </v>

47
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 1>hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't follow him perfectly.</v>

48
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.253
<v Speaker 1>Watch how the camera lingers after he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>left frame and then hurries to catch up </v>

49
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.224
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One film scholar calls this the </v>

50
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.564
<v Speaker 1>wandering camera because the camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambles along like it's own sentient </v>

51
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>being or here and imagined monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>stocking danny through the halls.</v>

52
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>This grates the sense the hotel is alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watching Danny through his vacation.</v>

53
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.503
<v Speaker 1>When the twins show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we move more intimately into a </v>

54
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>subjective sequence of Danny's pov </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashing between his bloody visions.</v>

55
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Danny covers his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks again,</v>

56
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.683
<v Speaker 1>and now they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps the girls are just in his </v>

57
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>head by starting with Danny's point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view as we follow him,</v>

58
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.093
<v Speaker 1>but then shifting to a possible camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters point of view and then back to </v>

59
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.594
<v Speaker 1>Danny's may be unreliable own vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film undermines our ability to </v>

60
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>interpret the events in front of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose point of view is this,</v>

61
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the hotel,</v>

62
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.853
<v Speaker 1>some demon that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's consider Jack is all this creepy </v>

63
00:03:58.301 --> 00:03:59.134
<v Speaker 1>stuff in his head too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did someone just spike the water with </v>

64
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.154
<v Speaker 1>Lsd in this otherwise normal hotel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take this scene in the apparently empty </v>

65
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>gold ballroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this scene,</v>

66
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>we go from a closeup of Jack as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly addresses an invisible being,</v>

67
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.743
<v Speaker 1>the reveal shot of Lloyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This subjective sequencing of shots </v>

68
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.494
<v Speaker 1>could suggest that Jack is hallucinating</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just when we're sure that this is </v>

69
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:24.964
<v Speaker 1>all a subjective delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kubrick moves the camera backward over </v>

70
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>his shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the shot from his direct point of</v>

71
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>view to a more objective one.</v>

72
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.953
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick gives the scene and objective </v>

73
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>reality by showing both characters in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot together,</v>

74
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.533
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think until Wendy shows up and the </v>

75
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>ballrooms suddenly empty and we're left </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally confused and creeped hours,</v>

76
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>so what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

77
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And the camera work makes sure we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>never find out.</v>

78
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.153
<v Speaker 1>Now at times Jack's point of view even </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to merge with that of the imagine </v>

79
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Predator that was following Danny in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this shot.</v>

80
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Jack's view looking down on the model </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge maze,</v>

81
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Glen's into an aerial view of his family</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering through the actual hedges.</v>

82
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>This effect happens again as he chases </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danny in the final scene.</v>

83
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.863
<v Speaker 1>See how the same kind of shot that used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be stuffing Danny through the halls </v>

84
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>has now mingled with Jack's point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

85
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Further confounding the various </v>
<v Speaker 1>supernatural elements of the film.</v>

86
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>We're not using point of view to screw </v>
<v Speaker 1>with reality.</v>

87
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick also uses our perception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical space to creep us out.</v>

88
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.493
<v Speaker 1>How do you make a huge otherwise normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel and presented as a claustrophobic </v>

89
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>nightmare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick is famous for what is called one</v>

90
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>point perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which adds to the cramped field with one</v>

91
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:47.764
<v Speaker 1>point perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Near perfect symmetry draws the </v>

92
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>audience's eye to the one vanishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>point at the center of the frame,</v>

93
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>giving this sensation that we're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn into the shot,</v>

94
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>which is further enhanced by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracking shot inward.</v>

95
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It feels uneasy like the walls are </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing inwards.</v>

96
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>That's why even though the overlook </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel seems like a spacious setting,</v>

97
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>we feel increasingly cramped as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie goes on,</v>

98
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.580
<v Speaker 1>almost like claustrophobic rear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can occur when people are shunning</v>

99
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.423
<v Speaker 1>together over long periods of time by </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposing large spaces with much </v>

100
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.164
<v Speaker 1>smaller ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick is able to get the viewer to </v>

101
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>feel really claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This starts with the opening shot of the</v>

102
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.004
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which cuts to the shot of the family </v>

103
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.553
<v Speaker 1>clown car style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we moved from the large sweeping </v>

104
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>hotel lobby to the Torrance is small </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel corridors.</v>

105
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.273
<v Speaker 1>While the hotel may be large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the torrance is are trapped and </v>

106
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>increasingly smaller spaces within it.</v>

107
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Jack ends up locked in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fridge.</v>

108
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Danny escapes through a tiny window and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody has any elbow room.</v>

109
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v Speaker 1>Through these tricks and perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Kubrick is able to add a layer </v>

110
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>of creepiness that if aid simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>

111
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the shining is so great </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why film nerds will continue to talk</v>

112
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.524
<v Speaker 1>about it for years to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much more to talk about in </v>

113
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>the shining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you liked this video,</v>

114
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>let us know if you want us to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

115
