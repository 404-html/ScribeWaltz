00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.873
<v Speaker 1>Problem with his papers is craigslist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy named Craig sets up a mailing </v>

2
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:20.051
<v Speaker 1>list and craigslist.org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ugliest site you've ever seen.</v>

3
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.063
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to get a couch unloaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you go instead of the </v>

4
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:25.814
<v Speaker 1>classifieds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the idea that somehow we owe it to </v>

5
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:29.444
<v Speaker 1>newspapers in order to get decent </v>
<v Speaker 1>reportage and have a New York Times </v>

6
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:32.744
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad bureau to subsidize them by not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing craigslist to exist so that we </v>

7
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>still have to go through them to place </v>
<v Speaker 1>our classifieds.</v>

8
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.593
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous enough notion that it's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt a straw man and nobody would ever </v>

9
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>say such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>so newspapers do have a problem in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they have to offer and what many of</v>

11
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:54.584
<v Speaker 1>us think is a good thing that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbiased reporting and professional </v>

12
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:02.711
<v Speaker 1>journalism seems to be a substitutable </v>
<v Speaker 1>product with cats,</v>

13
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:03.674
<v Speaker 1>flushing toilets on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so long as that's the case and </v>

14
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

15
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>news about a rock kept flushing toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch either of them.</v>

16
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>So long as the cat flushing the toilet </v>
<v Speaker 1>is cheaper,</v>

17
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that's going to have more supply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the demand will go.</v>

18
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.573
<v Speaker 1>So what we're really complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that there's some ethos and </v>

19
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:23.564
<v Speaker 1>profession of journalism that has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to high pressure market forces </v>

20
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>that are driving it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

21
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:31.784
<v Speaker 1>the real solution there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think the news is valuable and </v>

22
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>there isn't the market framework to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support it,</v>

23
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you subsidize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how you get NPR.</v>

24
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:41.144
<v Speaker 1>It's how you get pbs because you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet another channel of I dream of </v>

25
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Jeannie reruns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that's pound for pound,</v>

26
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>what earns more money for the channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>operator?</v>

27
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Then Pvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd rather have pbs in the mix too,</v>

28
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and we're prepared to see what we can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it happen.</v>
