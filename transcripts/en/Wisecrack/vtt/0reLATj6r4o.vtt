00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Globalization today is not just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread of product and ideas and money </v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.024
<v Speaker 1>and even people around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also about the arrangements that </v>

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>are made by companies to start operating</v>
<v Speaker 1>in new countries,</v>

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>to open up new factories and plants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>service operations.</v>

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.413
<v Speaker 1>When companies do those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they typically need middlemen to help </v>

6
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.184
<v Speaker 1>them enter those new markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those middlemen can have a variety </v>

7
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>of different occupations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need translators.</v>

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You need lawyers who can help you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt to a new legal system.</v>

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.573
<v Speaker 1>You need accountants because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always new accounting systems and </v>

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.364
<v Speaker 1>regulations to you need fixers who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you to find locations for your new </v>

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you to deal with local officials.</v>

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.803
<v Speaker 1>You need a whole variety of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are middlemen because they operate </v>

13
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 1>between the foreign company that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in and all of the domestic </v>

14
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they be governments or companies</v>

15
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>or citizens groups on the ground.</v>

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>This is truly important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization.</v>

17
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.563
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do these middlemen get their </v>

18
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>return?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.043
<v Speaker 1>they usually get paid a fee up front </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the company is entering the new </v>

20
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>market saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

21
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.203
<v Speaker 1>there is some value to our being here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're willing to pay a small </v>

22
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.914
<v Speaker 1>percentage of that value to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who help us to open our operation and </v>

23
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that small percentage is what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middlemen received.</v>

24
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>They get that upfront payment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a middle man,</v>

25
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:16.764
<v Speaker 1>this is fantastic because you can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>one company to open an operation in a </v>

26
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.484
<v Speaker 1>new country and then you can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>another company and another and each </v>

27
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.474
<v Speaker 1>time you're going to get that little </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the total value of that </v>

28
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>company's engagement with that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

29
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.983
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middlemen have lots of opportunities </v>

30
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can specialize in a sector.</v>

31
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>You could work only with companies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and gas industries.</v>

32
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>They could specialize in a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

33
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.134
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be the law firm for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>American company that wants to enter </v>

34
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

35
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.083
<v Speaker 1>There are many ways that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure their business and economists </v>

36
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>have found that they are able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>this significant upfront payment.</v>

37
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:54.774
<v Speaker 1>isn't this damaging?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't this take money away from the </v>

39
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:57.894
<v Speaker 1>company and from the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground who might have benefit who </v>

40
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>might've benefited from the company's </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations there?</v>

41
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really because there had to be some </v>

42
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.024
<v Speaker 1>sort of opening up the gates to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies to come in and this is </v>

43
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>what the middle men provide in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm.</v>

44
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>It's good for the economies on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
