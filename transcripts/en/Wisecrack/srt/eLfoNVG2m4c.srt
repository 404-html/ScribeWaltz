1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,230
Wise,
crack real life.

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:05,064
Jared here,
I know you got used to only rick and 

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,464
morty quick takes,
but the biggest show on earth just 

4
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:13,260
wrapped its seventh season and man,
there were some amazing moments.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,230
The Jamie Tyrian Reunion,
incredible battles,

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,093
lady [inaudible] Lennon's death scene.
Aria murdering the phrase the Zombie 

7
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:22,830
Dragon going ham.
Plenty of awesome stuff.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,380
But to be honest,
in our humble opinion,

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,840
the show just doesn't feel as a magical 
anymore.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,390
And of course we had to ask ourselves 
why.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,433
Game of thrones,
by virtue of adapting George Rr Martin 

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,143
is revolutionary series got us all 
hooked by refusing to play by the rules 

13
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:41,370
of the fantasy genre or even normal tv.
It took turns.

14
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,204
We never saw coming killed characters we
were sure would be around for the end 

15
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:49,230
game and turn the tropes of the fantasy 
genre inside out.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,393
It was that willingness to show the ugly
side of the Lords and ladies that made 

17
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:54,564
us fall in love.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,340
These days it's feeling a little eagles 
rescue the boys from Mount Doom.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,413
Why?
Maybe it's because game of thrones set 

20
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,410
up the unique specific rules for its 
world.

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,770
Made promises about what we could expect
or not expect.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,230
And now that it's time to pay off those 
ideas,

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,690
well it just feels like a different 
show.

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,380
So let's talk about whether or not 
dineros and friends have lost their edge

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,190
in today's quick take on game of thrones
season seven and as always,

26
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:24,000
spoilers ahead before we can explain 
what's going on with theme of thrones,

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,870
we need to talk about story structure,
react structure to be specific.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,000
Even if you've never heard that phrase 
before,

29
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,840
you've seen it in action because almost 
every story in the world follows it.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,153
Without getting too much into detail,
we can describe three x structure like 

31
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:38,484
this.
In Act one the major players in central 

32
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,060
conflicts are introduced in act two 
events complicate those conflicts.

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,150
And finally in act three of these 
conflicts are resolved.

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,850
These categories are used to describe 
parts of a story.

35
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,190
So while they may seem like arbitrary 
cutoff points,

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,430
they are indicative of patterns we see 
in almost every story.

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,610
So let's take that basic structure and 
apply it to game of thrones.

38
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,910
Act One is the first two seasons we meet
the lannisters.

39
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,840
The starks Denaris and the whole gang.
We learned about the iron throne and how

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,733
everybody wants it.
We even see the white walkers the first 

41
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:14,040
that culminates with each side taking 
positions and making their moves.

42
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,160
Act Two is the war itself.
We see the costs.

43
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,740
Rob As the red wedding,
Stan is burning his daughter,

44
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:23,610
joffrey getting poisoned all with the 
undead threat looming in the background.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,200
These days we're firmly enact three John
and Danny are preparing to face off with

46
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,034
the white walkers.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,550
While CRC is going crazy,
trying to hang onto her new found power.

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,713
The show pretty much nailed acts one and
two not only did they establish 

49
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:37,494
characters in conflict,
they did so in a creative way that 

50
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:40,614
challenged our expectations after season
one who really thought we'd all grow a 

51
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,534
soft spot for Jamie lannister.
The thing is all these twists and turns 

52
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:53,940
set us up to expect an ending that would
follow the same unpredictable pattern.

53
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,200
Sounds weird.
I know,

54
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,063
but that's what made it so great and 
season seven that's turning into a bit 

55
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,230
of a challenge.
So let's see how it happened.

56
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,080
The show.
May Two major promises early on.

57
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,750
First,
it was a dedication to breaking down the

58
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,160
attractiveness of the fantasy world.
It's not all gowns and gallantry.

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,173
Instead,
it showed us the dark underbelly and 

60
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,530
cruelty that infects every inch of 
Westerns.

61
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,140
The nights aren't paragons of justice.

62
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,920
They're rapists and murderers.
The beautiful prince isn't kind.

63
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,813
He's a spoiled monster.
Honor doesn't help you reach new 

64
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,720
heights.
It puts you in jail.

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,913
Magic isn't something friendly.
It involves sacrifices and shadow 

66
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:33,574
monsters,
but good guys who fight for justice 

67
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,630
don't always win.
In fact,

68
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,420
they usually die because everyone else 
is playing dirty.

69
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,613
The landslide Gwen of your style,
forbidden love between a knight and his 

70
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,540
Queen in Game of thrones,
that's incest.

71
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,463
This is the show that killed robb stark 
who would be the hero in any other 

72
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:53,380
fantasy story at his uncle's Dang 
wedding,

73
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,483
a double subversions.
Since rob was living out the narrative 

74
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,424
of love overcoming all,
only it did the lannisters cutoff Ned's 

75
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
head because he was too loyal.
They shoved a kid out a window for 

76
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:05,824
seeing something he shouldn't have.
These moments were more than just cool 

77
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,454
Vitsa TV.
There were signals that game of thrones 

78
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,240
was not business as usual.

79
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,580
That brings us to the second major 
promise.

80
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,970
The show promised us that actions would 
have consequences.

81
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,403
We see this in episode one.
A man shirks is nightwatch duties and 

82
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,230
ned decapitating,
no questions asked.

83
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,393
That's the world of the show.
Nothing comes without a cost and even 

84
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,470
the greatest victories can have 
ramifications.

85
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,304
The characters never expected.
There's a storytelling value at play 

86
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,680
here.
It means that everything matters.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,633
That's why this is the show that 
launched a million conspiracy theories 

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,970
for several seasons.
Consequences where the law of the land,

89
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,013
for example,
why is no one mad at Cersi for blowing 

90
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,680
up the CEP and killing Marjorie Tyrrell?
Someone we know was hugely popular.

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,490
Do they just not know?
Maybe it's because they're mad at CRC or

92
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,324
afraid of her,
but these folks seem like they're doing 

93
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,694
just fine.
We can also see this and how the show 

94
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:04,540
handles travel.
These days.

95
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,150
The logistics push the limits of 
plausibility.

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,330
For instance,
Dendri turns into Usain Bolt and sends a

97
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,450
raven at a speed far greater than an 
unladen swallow,

98
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,493
which crosses Westeros a continent 
described as the size of South America 

99
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,383
to Generis who flies her dragon's back 
across the continent all before the 

100
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:25,270
magnificent seven can even get frost in 
their beards.

101
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,343
See,
it's not just that fast travel strains 

102
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,970
credulity.
It actively harms the dramatic action of

103
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,910
the show when travel stops being a 
factor.

104
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,803
So does the danger of traveling.
One huge element of the travel times in 

105
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,094
thrones Burley storytelling is the 
implication that something could go 

106
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,960
wrong on any trip.
Bandon,

107
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,280
Stoneman,
slavers,

108
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,143
whatever that risk means that we can 
imagine a huge number of possible 

109
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,580
outcomes,
but in fast travel world,

110
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,340
that's not really on the table.
All of that nuance,

111
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,174
the repercussions,
the sense that anything can happen any 

112
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,790
moment is now gone.

113
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,690
It got traded for expedited plotting and
well,

114
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:03,524
it's a trade that makes sense.
There were only 13 episodes left when 

115
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,810
the season started,
but it's changed.

116
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:09,644
The nature of the show.
Game of thrones was so interesting for 

117
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,614
the first five seasons in change because
it was decidedly not your daddy's 

118
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,690
fantasy story.
Now,

119
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,390
this is something that any parent could 
recognize.

120
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,493
All the tired and familiar tropes that 
game of thrones was deconstructing are 

121
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:30,071
back in full force on ambiguous evil 
Quebec on killable chosen ones.

122
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,510
Check Dsx,
Mokena rescues and check,

123
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,330
check,
check.

124
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,810
This isn't a show heading in new 
different directions.

125
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,930
This is a show that is checking third 
act boxes.

126
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,853
That's not necessarily a bad thing,
but it's checking them in a way that 

127
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,364
defies the narrative framework.
We spent five years internalizing even 

128
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,680
the finale,
which was pretty dang good,

129
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,510
showed off all these problems.

130
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,630
As the season came to a close,
we got clear sides,

131
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,330
something game of thrones has been 
reluctant to offer us.

132
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,570
Now all the characters we like are on 
one side.

133
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,590
There's no room for ethical ambiguity.
So why is this happening?

134
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,483
Well,
it goes back to that three act 

135
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,314
structure.
Thousands of years of storytelling 

136
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,190
indicate that to create a satisfying 
narrative,

137
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,890
the show needs to have all the work that
Danny,

138
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:19,730
John and others have put into change.
The world actually pay off.

139
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,623
Unfortunately,
that's how all fantasy stories and the 

140
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,850
good guys always win against incredible 
odds.

141
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,390
The subversion doesn't work anymore when
it comes to the end game.

142
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,343
Even the craziest brand is the night 
king type ending doesn't really subvert 

143
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,964
anything and ending where this was all 
inevitable because of magic or time 

144
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:38,944
travel undermines the theme of agency in
the show and it's just another fantasy 

145
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:44,150
trope for the show to fall back on.

146
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,163
Unfortunately,
it seems the show can't get to the 

147
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:47,774
ending it wants while still disrupting 
the fantasy narrative space from the 

148
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:52,574
beginning.
Game of thrones has told us that we're 

149
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,120
getting a different kind of fantasy 
story,

150
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,283
but this past season it felt more like 
Lord of the rings than the Sopranos and 

151
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:04,220
honestly it's a bit disappointing.
Look at the end of the day,

152
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,054
it's still a good show,
but it's an action fantasy story and 

153
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,650
that's not what they promised us.
Thanks for watching guys piece.
