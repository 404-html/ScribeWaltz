1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,990
The more recent finding is this pure 
fat,

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,100
uh,
where were we?

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:15,934
You know,
we did a study where we had people come 

4
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,290
into the lab,
um,

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,860
to take a battery of risk taking and 
decision making measures on a computer.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,143
And we asked him to come and bring two 
friends with them and then we randomly 

7
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,640
assigned them to either do these tasks 
by themselves,

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,470
um,
or to do it with their friends,

9
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:32,200
watching them.
Uh,

10
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:35,800
and we had teenagers,
college undergraduate sent adults,

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,520
you know,
30 or so years old.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,463
And so what we found in this study was 
that the mere presence of peers doubled 

13
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,140
the number of risks that adolescents 
took.

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,603
It had a 50% increase among college 
students and no effect at all among 

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,950
adults.
Now,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,830
uh,
this was really interesting to me.

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,750
Nobody had shown this experimentally 
before.

18
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,763
Let's consistent with the idea that most
adolescent risk taking occurs when 

19
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:01,040
they're in groups and with their 
friends.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,100
So we've,
we just recently,

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,430
uh,
my colleague Jason [inaudible],

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,273
who is a neuroscientist and I just 
recently took this experiment into the 

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,800
Ri.
So we have this subjects,

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,460
uh,
with their brains being scanned.

25
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,040
And they're lying down in the magnet at 
the computer screen is in there that can

26
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,420
do the tasks,
the same task.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,800
We haven't come with two friends,
their friends are in the next room.

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,240
Their friends can see their performance 
on a monitor that's in the next room and

29
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,180
their friends are miked into the magnet.
So,

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,510
uh,
on cue when we tell the friends,

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,250
they say,
okay Dave,

32
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,720
I'm watching you now.
All right.

33
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,183
Um,
and we compare people's performance on 

34
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:39,944
these tasks when they know their friends
are watching them and when they know 

35
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,214
their friends can't see them at all.
So they're not even in the same room 

36
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,910
with them.
They just are aware of their presence.

37
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,013
I mean,
they're not encouraging them to take 

38
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:51,410
risks or anything like that cause we 
script what they're allowed to say.

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,340
And we've just discovered in the process
of writing this up right now to send out

40
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,174
to the journal that the presence of 
peers activates the brain systems that 

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,890
are in this reward circuit that we've 
been talking about in kids.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,933
But it doesn't in adults.
And so we think that the reason that we 

43
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:18,101
saw the pure fact is that when you are 
with your friends,

44
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,034
when you were a teenager,
it increases the salience of the 

45
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:22,514
rewarding aspects of a risky decision,
which then of course there's going to 

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,310
make you pursued the risky decision 
rather than be risk averse.

47
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,060
So we're really excited about this 
finding.

48
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,530
Um,
and uh,

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,120
we,
we,

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,953
we,
I was just working on a paper this 

51
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:41,270
morning in which we looked at,
um,

52
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,643
the impact of the presence of friends on
People's preferences for immediate 

53
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,150
versus delayed rewards.

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,820
And we were just doing this in the skin 
are now,

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
but in,
in our behavioral research,

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,233
we see the same thing.
So we have a sample of 19 year olds and 

57
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,350
they,
they do this task,

58
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,184
it's called the delay discounting task 
where basically measures how much you'd 

59
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,534
be,
how much less of a reward you'd be 

60
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,960
willing to take to get it now rather 
than waiting.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,580
Okay.
Um,

62
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,960
when the 19 year olds do this with their
friends watching them,

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,150
they make decisions that are comparable 
to what 14 year olds make.

64
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,773
Um,
but when 19 year olds do it with their 

65
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,760
friends,
not watching them,

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,480
they behave like adults.
And so again,

67
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,100
it's this impact of peers on reward 
processing that seems to be going on,

68
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:28,570
that may play a role in understanding 
risk taking.

69
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,410
So,
uh,

70
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,530
when,
when we first saw it,

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:30,951
you,
you,

72
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,410
you asked what gets me excited?
You know,

73
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,730
when we first saw these brain scans,
we couldn't believe it because it looked

74
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:38,890
too beautiful to be true.
And we peaked,

75
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,940
you know,
kind of early on,

76
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,030
we'd only run,
you know,

77
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,630
a couple dozen subjects and now we've 
done the whole experiment.

78
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,470
And,
um,

79
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,990
it's,
it's just amazing.

80
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:46,380
It's,
it,

81
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,680
it has held up.
So we're really,

82
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,030
really jazzed about this.
