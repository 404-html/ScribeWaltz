1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,340
There is a rapid rise in the demand for 
new skills.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,770
In fact,
we see that at the individual levels and

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:13,320
we see this at aggregate levels.
Uh,

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:17,490
there's a growing gap between the 
employment and labor market prospects of

5
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,324
people who are highly skilled and people
at the lower end of the skill spectrum 

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,893
skills determine more and more how the 
benefits of economic growth I shat in 

7
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,280
society.
So success of companies today depends on

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:33,450
nothing more than on the talent pool 
which they recruit.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,493
70% of productivity gains have been bay 
basically driven by improvements in the 

10
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,304
skill base.
So there is a dramatically a rising 

11
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:44,514
demand for better skilled people.
At the very same time we also see that 

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,714
uh,
in some countries there are many 

13
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,024
graduates unemployed on the street while
employers say they cannot find the 

14
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,394
people with the skills they need.
So there is a emerging mismatch between 

15
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,864
the kind of talent that is being 
developed and the talent that is really 

16
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:03,894
needed.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,733
Tech.
One of the things that our data show us 

18
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,224
that some of the scales that are easiest
to teach and easiest to test are also 

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,490
the kind of skill set are easiest to 
digitize,

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,640
automate and outsource.
Sort of.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,533
That's a big challenge for,
for the Education Industry today to 

22
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,840
think about,
you know,

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,890
what are they kind of 21st century 
skills that will enable people.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,943
You know,
in the past you could assume as a 

25
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,810
teacher you will teach someone for the 
lifetime.

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,060
You know what you learn in school.
It's going to last for many,

27
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,400
many years.
Today there's no longer the case today.

28
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,300
We need to educate people for jobs that 
have not been created,

29
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,134
to use technologies that haven't been 
invented to solve social and economic 

30
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,190
problems that we don't have any idea I 
want to arise.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
This is sort of the fundamental 
challenge for education and that 

32
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,640
requires a very different caliber of 
teachers,

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,860
teachers who are not just reproducing 
sort of or educating the reproduction of

34
00:01:58,861 --> 00:01:59,694
subject matter content,
but it help young people to extrapolate 

35
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,200
from what they know to use and apply 
their knowledge in novel situations.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,380
In a nutshell,
the world economy no longer pays you for

37
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,590
what you know.
Google knows everything.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,333
The world economy piece you for what you
can do with what you know in that 

39
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,440
requires a very different caliber of 
teachers,

40
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:23,460
a very different pedagogy.
21st century Podagra be a very different

41
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:26,700
relationship between teachers and 
students.

42
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,623
Technology is part of this today.
It's hard to explain why you should 

43
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,704
accept the teacher next door if you can 
have access to the world's best 

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,693
knowledge anymore.
We're seeing in an unbundling of 

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,700
educational content,
educational delivery,

46
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,900
and accreditation with people anywhere 
drawing on the world's best knowledge at

47
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,734
any time.
We are seeing governments putting 

48
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,500
greater emphasis on evaluating outcomes 
on quality assurance,

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,130
on setting standards,
and the business sector actually being a

50
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,950
lot more engaged in helping education 
systems.

51
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,090
Figuring out,
you know,

52
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:00,924
where his labor demand evolving,
what are the kinds of skills that will 

53
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,204
be there at a premium tomorrow.
The business sector playing a very 

54
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,790
important role in as an education 
provider,

55
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,040
engaging actively in the design and 
delivery of instructional system,

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,000
providing educational and learning 
opportunities for people in many,

57
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,834
many contexts.
At least we're seeing this in some 

58
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,300
countries.
It's in others.

59
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,320
It's still a big challenge.
