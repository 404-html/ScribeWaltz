1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,280
Worldview?
Well,

2
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,114
I,
I,

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,170
I'm a great believer in him and liberty.
I think,

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,210
uh,
the,

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,363
the genius of the American experiment is
a respect for the dignity of the 

6
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,710
individual.
And,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,693
um,
that's why I'm opposed to a trade 

8
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:32,740
restrictions.
Uh,

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,320
I'm opposed to most immigration 
restrictions.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,410
I think human beings are human beings 
and,

11
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,244
uh,
and that they had deserve the dignity 

12
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,640
of,
of freedom.

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,860
And that's a worldwide phenomenon.
I must say that in the 30 years the Cato

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,830
Institute is existed,
and I'm not saying we deserve credit for

15
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:51,664
it,
but,

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,583
uh,
the extension of human freedom has been 

17
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,000
remarkable.
I mean,

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,970
hundreds of millions of people are freer
today,

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,480
more prosperous today,
uh,

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,820
because of the recognition that markets 
work,

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,630
uh,
the expansion of trade,

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,160
the,
um,

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,430
uh,
recognition of the importance of private

24
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,110
property.
Um,

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,620
those are great things.
And I,

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,190
I,
I view them as universal.

27
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,024
I mean,
the Cato Institute is actively involved 

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,330
in promoting these ideas in,
uh,

29
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,390
in the Middle East,
in Russia and Latin America,

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,500
uh,
China.

31
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,370
Um,
so we held the first conferences devoted

32
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:42,430
to freedom in the history of communist 
China.

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,400
And in the history of the Soviet Union.
Uh,

34
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:49,690
we went to China in 1988 and,
uh,

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,530
we brought,
uh,

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,230
Milton Friedman there.
And Milton was treated like a rockstar.

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,410
Uh,
it was very exciting.

38
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,750
And then,
uh,

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,370
two years later we were in Moscow and,
uh,

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,330
and had the first conference they're 
devoted to,

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,170
to political and economic freedom.
And,

42
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,930
uh,
so I'm very proud of the cato institutes

43
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,280
orientation.
It's not simply parochial.

44
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:16,114
I mean we are around the world trying to
promote the concept of the dignity of 

45
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,274
the individual.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,430
Well,
um,

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,051
you know,
the,

48
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:31,051
the basic kind of classical Roth Bharti 
and approach to libertarianism is,

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,870
is,
uh,

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,470
uh,
that,

51
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,380
uh,
you can't have,

52
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,760
and this is a randy and I Iran's 
approach to the initiation of force.

53
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,594
It's wrong that people should be able to
do whatever they want to do as long as 

54
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:48,320
they're not harming other people in 
doing so,

55
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:53,321
whether through fraud or physical 
violence or a theft or,

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,120
uh,
whatever,

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,313
uh,
so that you want the maximum amount of 

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
individual liberty.
But you know,

59
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,590
it's interesting.
Um,

60
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,700
it's not all clear cut in theory from a 
purely rights standpoint.

61
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,900
What Michael Vick did with these dogs 
was,

62
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,460
didn't,
uh,

63
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,100
didn't,
uh,

64
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,010
offend anyone's personal rights.
But I think as a libertarian,

65
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,460
and maybe I'm,
I'm,

66
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:25,294
uh,
I'm getting in trouble with my 

67
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,390
colleagues,
but I th I think that,

68
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,410
uh,
uh,

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,113
uh,
in a free society that you should be 

70
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,150
able to say,
you know,

71
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:34,984
you can't torture animals and that's 
going to be a crime and it doesn't fit 

72
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,190
in neatly with a libertarian theory of 
rights.

73
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,130
But I think it's,
that's the way it should be.

74
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,690
Of course,
I love dogs so,

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,910
well,
I think the proper role of the,

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,550
the government is the protection of 
life,

77
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,384
liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
which is what the declaration of 

78
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,320
Independence said.
I mean,

79
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,730
that's a very,
very,

80
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,683
uh,
radical concept that government should 

81
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,190
be limited,
uh,

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,570
to protecting your right to live your 
life as,

83
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,660
as you,
uh,

84
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,520
choose.
Um,

85
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,420
I also think,
you know,

86
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,254
the phrase,
the pursuit of happiness is uniquely 

87
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:18,110
American.
I mean,

88
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:23,111
it is saying that life is a good thing 
and that you should be able to enjoy it.

89
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:29,030
And happiness is not saying you should 
go to a party every night.

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,890
It's saying you should be able to pursue
your values and your goals in life.

91
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,330
And,
uh,

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,920
I think that's a reasonable goal for 
government.

93
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,783
Uh,
I,

94
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,391
I,
you know,

95
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,470
obviously,
uh,

96
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,060
uh,
clean air and water,

97
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,400
you shouldn't be able to pollute what 
the,

98
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,520
the average citizen has to deal with.
Uh,

99
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,680
those are legitimate functions of 
government.
