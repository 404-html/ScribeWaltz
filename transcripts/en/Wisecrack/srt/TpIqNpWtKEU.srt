1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
Yeah,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,220
a wise crack.
Did somebody.

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:05,054
Jared here,
I'm here today to talk to you about an 

4
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:10,130
issue of grave importance,
a dark stain on our generation,

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,113
the Emoji movie.
Now you probably all know most of the 

6
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:16,760
reasons to hate the Emoji movie.
It served as a family friendly vessel to

7
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:20,120
cram as many shameless product 
placements as 90 minutes can fit.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,193
It's also predictable,
painfully unfunny and tries to convey a 

9
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:25,940
moral message as gracefully as this.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,950
There's another reason you should hate 
the Emoji movie.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,903
It's politics and that's because while 
it tries to tell a story about 

12
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,430
inclusivity,
it's so poorly thought out.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,310
That advantage is not only to fail at 
being inclusive,

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,173
but accomplishes the exact opposite,
presenting us with a hopeless 

15
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,270
totalitarian nightmare.
Seriously,

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,283
welcome.
This wise crack addition on the Emoji 

17
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,810
movie,
what went wrong,

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,660
and just in case anyone gives us 
spoilers ahead,

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,300
but first a recap.
The emoji movie takes place in Tech.

20
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,134
Stopple is a city of 70 into emojis.
Inside some kid named Alex his phone 

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,330
gene,
a Emoji decides to stop mooching off his

22
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:10,590
parents and get a job in boating for his
human overlord problem is he has trouble

23
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:14,940
maintaining his madness,
expressing a range of emotions instead,

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,480
but since being met is his function,
he says,

25
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,520
job up gets labeled a malfunction

26
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,470
if you have expressions other than 
function

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,480
and evades deletion from the text Apolis
Fas,

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,523
as the movie drags on his antics 
threatened to kill him and everyone he 

29
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,290
loves.
Once Alex tires have issues,

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,320
wireless wireless,
I'd like to make an appointment.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,073
This phone is playing games with me.
He's just scape is assisted by princess 

32
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,450
turned hacker and a high five who loves 
to dance.

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,210
Alex decides to wipe his broken phone.

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
I wanted to leave everything to it.

35
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,500
Jean witnesses the deaths of all his 
friends,

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,393
which is definitely his fault.
He manages to malfunction with 

37
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,604
confidence and grace,
allowing Alex to properly mack on some 

38
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,430
girl.

39
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,990
That's super cool.
Emoji.

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,013
In the end,
Alex is happy with his broken phone 

41
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,414
because it's made him a mack daddy and 
gene gets to express himself however he 

42
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,254
pleases the end.
The emoji movie is certainly trying to 

43
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,674
espouse a noble message that we are not 
bound by tradition or birth and can 

44
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:19,580
become whatever we want.
It's not a new trope.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,473
The nobles overcome their birth name for
her bidden love a warrior who wants to 

46
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:24,584
fight in spite of societal expectations 
or pretty much any story where someone 

47
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:29,144
packed their bags to escape their small 
town existence or the big city 

48
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:34,250
lifestyle.
It's an easy enough concept.

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,200
One,
you'd have to try really,

50
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:41,201
really hard to botch and with that,
the movie botched literally every single

51
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:46,910
opportunity to sell that message so much
so it's worth discussing.

52
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:49,010
Before we get into the totalitarian 
stuff.

53
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,250
First there's jailbreak,
a princess Emoji by birth,

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,330
but she'd rather do cool hacker stuff 
like wearing beanies and watching Mr.

55
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:57,164
robot,
instead of doing princess stuff 

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,473
throughout film,
she assists gene and escaping to the 

57
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,410
cloud.
Innovating deletion.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,740
She eventually saves the day by throwing
away the hacker costume,

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,650
reverting to a princess and whistling 
for the twitter bird.

60
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,480
In other words,
you can grow up to be anything you want,

61
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,314
but when push comes to shove,
you're going to have to sacrifice who 

62
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,540
you are in order to become what society 
always expected of you.

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,160
It kind of be like the plot of Milan,
but if Milan saved the day by going home

64
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,994
and cooking her father,
a nice dinner before folding his 

65
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,364
laundry,
then there's gene who was born a man 

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,513
Emoji,
but it's capable of laughing and 

67
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,554
screaming and having sweet glasses.
He faces discrimination by not falling 

68
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,050
in line with the identity society has 
put out for him,

69
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,033
but a conversation between genes.
Parents reveals that his father has the 

70
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,084
same malfunction,
suggesting that gene's malfunction is 

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,410
gene netic.
Get it.

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,273
Jean,

73
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,410
regardless of whether or not emojis have
DNA,

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,140
the idea that genes whole identity is 
inherited,

75
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,550
further undercuts the message that 
society and birth shouldn't dictate what

76
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,384
we aspire to be and because bad 
decisions apparently come in threes to 

77
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:08,200
further cement the message that we all 
contain some innate,

78
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,000
inescapable nature.
By birth,

79
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,660
the high five Emoji reminds us why he 
has to press buttons.

80
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,283
It's a big red button and eventually 
saves the day by performing the task he 

81
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,730
was born to do.
Now,

82
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:22,564
that's not to say the movie can't be 
trying to teach people to have 

83
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,240
confidence in the things they can't 
change about themselves,

84
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,223
but it also manages to more or less 
demonstrate that you can achieve 

85
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:37,240
greatness if your genetics allow.
It also manages to turn Internet trolls,

86
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,770
who in real life are horrible people by 
their own volition into an identity that

87
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:45,760
one is born into and therefore can not 
choose Emoji.

88
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,670
I thought the conversation just got 
dahmer.

89
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,983
Internet trolls,
just ignore them so instead we get the 

90
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,900
equivalent of a racial underclass 
subject to constant denigration,

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
so much for inclusion,
but even if we wanted to concede that 

92
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,740
the emoji movie really was about being 
comfortable in your identity,

93
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,700
there's another scarier problem.
It offers us a vision of the future.

94
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:07,534
That to paraphrase George Orwell's 19,
84 is pretty much a boot stamping on an 

95
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,780
Emoji face forever.
On one level,

96
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,450
the Emoji movie shows us an 
authoritarian nightmare.

97
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,284
In it's emphatic,
fewer smiler emojis are put into the 

98
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,674
service of the messaging APP and 
anything that interferes with the 

99
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,210
functioning of that APP must be 
eliminated.

100
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,253
While gene supposedly overthrows this 
order by flaunting his God given 

101
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,154
talents,
what can we infer really happened to 

102
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,090
text opolis afterwards to figure that 
out,

103
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,924
we need a little help from German 
philosopher Max Horkheimer Horkheimer 

104
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,770
wrote extensively about an idea called 
instrumental rationality or instrumental

105
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,604
reason and believe that played a crucial
role in the domination of humanity 

106
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,480
throughout the 20th century,
especially into solitary and regimes.

107
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,763
Instrumental rationality is the kind of 
reason we use to achieve a particular 

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,633
end.
If I've decided the wise crack team 

109
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,950
needs to eat,
50 pounds of pizza.

110
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,440
Instrumental reason can help me figure 
out the best,

111
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,470
most efficient way for them to build 
their bodies with regret.

112
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,573
Drink lots of water the day before.
Go for the toppings with high water 

113
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,050
content.
Smoke lots of Ganja,

114
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,003
but instrumental rationality is 
dangerous because it doesn't ask bigger 

115
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,040
questions like,
why am I trying to destroy my body?

116
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,700
Or why in God's name did I just spend 
$300 on pizza?

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,953
And while Horkheimer wasn't talking 
about pizza or other everyday uses of 

118
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,064
practical reason,
he noted that modern society was fueled 

119
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
by this flawed kind of rationality,
always figuring out the fastest way to 

120
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,414
get somewhere,
never trying to figure out if it was 

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,663
even worth it at all.
Texts apolis seems to be run on this 

122
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,750
kind of instrumental rationality.

123
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,430
The whole society is organized for one 
purpose to deliver Alex the emojis.

124
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,850
He selects here.
Each of us does one thing and we have to

125
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,150
nail it every time.
There are never questions like,

126
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,670
why does Alex get to pick the Emoji?
Or Hey,

127
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,563
isn't this technically slavery?
And there's good reason if they go on 

128
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:59,990
strike outs will probably uninstalled 
the APP and murder them all.

129
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,033
See,
this is the problem with 

130
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,090
anthropomorphizing utilities in films 
where there are humans present.

131
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,700
It's cute at first,
but when you think about it,

132
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,534
it gets pretty horrified.
The problem with instrumental 

133
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:14,750
rationality for Horkheimer is that it 
aids in the domination of humanity since

134
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,230
it's concerned with questions like 
efficiency and usefulness,

135
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,790
both nature and humanity become inputs 
in the assembly line of society.

136
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,270
As we reduced our inner nature to 
instrumental functions,

137
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,163
we lose any strong sense of self and 
thus lack the inner substance in a 

138
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:35,831
manner that makes us metaphorically into
nobody's and when everyone is reduced to

139
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,570
a use value,
things get even scarier.

140
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,703
It's for this reason that Horkheimer and
his fellow Frankfurt school thinkers 

141
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,513
characterize the totalitarianism of the 
19 thirties as the ultimate danger of 

142
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:50,420
the instrumental rationality that 
pervades our modern world.

143
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,650
We see the totalitarian danger of this 
everywhere in the Emoji movie society is

144
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,484
organized based on how individual emojis
can be instrumentalized in the surface 

145
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,624
of Alex.
emojis are used often get to go to the 

146
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:06,260
cool parties and are popular with peers 
while those unused get sent to the loser

147
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,094
lounge and those that disturb the peace.
As with gene get liquidated and while 

148
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,950
the existential threat of getting 
deleted,

149
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
they sound like good rationalization for
killing gene.

150
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,430
It's also worth noting that most 
authoritarian regimes sell their message

151
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,010
through existential threats.
You know the whole,

152
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,800
it's either this or the demise of the 
German people stick,

153
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,230
so it was gene's victory in the climax 
of the film,

154
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:30,320
a blow against the authoritarian terror 
of smiler.

155
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,580
Well,
no.

156
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,550
Yes,
Jean is a revered hero.

157
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:38,551
High five is popular again,
and the exclusive vip parties of the old

158
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,390
regime are now open to all from now on.

159
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,940
Welcome.
What is all this?

160
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,830
It's for you Jane.
However,

161
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,663
in the after credit scene,
we see smuggler relegated to the loser 

162
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:57,521
lounge confirming a sill existing 
between usable and unusable emojis,

163
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,973
but for Horkheimer,
this shouldn't be much of a surprise as 

164
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,780
he writes what is usually indicated as a
goal.

165
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,810
The happiness of the individual health 
wealth gains at significance exclusively

166
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,580
from its functional potentiality.
In other words,

167
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,414
the happiness of everyone in text opolis
is only significant in that Alex is 

168
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,404
texting app still works.
Nothing is solved in regards to the 

169
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,800
extreme instrumental rationality of 
textile pollutes.

170
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,780
Emojis are still instrumentalized for 
Alex,

171
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,240
and if gene's malfunction is now 
popular,

172
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,790
it's only by the whims of their human 
overlord.

173
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,773
We even get an Emoji dance where emojis 
are seemingly free to emote as they 

174
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,644
pleased,
but this expressiveness is only 

175
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:40,230
permissible in so far as it doesn't 
threaten Alex's social prowess,

176
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,590
and because the film hints that gene's 
malfunction is inherited,

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,513
the implication is a new dystopia where 
those with a quasi genetic mutation can 

178
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,830
better serve Alex.

179
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,250
while those born of lesser genes can 
still be discarded.

180
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,263
So while we may have thought that the 
end of smilers regime would have meant 

181
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,870
liberation of emotions and text Apolis,
the fact that Alex is still the ultimate

182
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,660
judge of functionality means nothing has
changed.

183
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,720
Basically,
the Emoji still live under the iron fist

184
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,950
of Alex because nothing has been done to
undermine their instrumentalization.

185
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,610
What will become of gene when Alex tires
have is ultimately meaningless?

186
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:17,940
Emoting one day he may decide to do away
with whatever money,

187
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:20,370
eyes slash kissing face slash 
sunglasses,

188
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,130
emoji means and go straight for the 
eggplant Emoji.

189
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,520
As if to foreshadow this high five tells
us early in the film

190
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,363
what you need off fans.
They give you complete an unrelenting 

191
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,270
support as long as you're on top.

192
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,383
And here's the issue with making emojis,
which are things with an actual 

193
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:39,764
function,
a metaphor for humans who are more than 

194
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:42,974
a utility on a smartphone APP,
it makes a lot more sense to delete and 

195
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,544
Emoji for not doing its job than 
murdering a human for not doing its job 

196
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,760
in textile apolis.
If the system truly goes too far,

197
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,683
Alex can just get another phone that's 
not exactly how human civilization 

198
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:57,794
works.
And here we can see the shift in how 

199
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:02,810
domination happens.
Whereas 100 years ago,

200
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:05,960
the system enforced its rules with 
repression like smilers,

201
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,883
our modern society strengthen their rule
with liberation or at least liberation 

202
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:11,324
within bounds.
As fellow Frankfurt School Herbert 

203
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:16,400
marcuse or wrote,
many of the freedoms afforded to western

204
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,234
civilization only served to make the 
repression of those societies more 

205
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,314
efficient.
We're given the freedom of how to exist 

206
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:23,834
within the system,
but never the freedom to escape the 

207
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,420
system.

208
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,980
The Post almost apocalypse world of text
habilis certainly seems more permissive,

209
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,730
but what has been omitted from the story
is the possibility of escape.

210
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,610
Jailbreak once resisted the system by 
escaping it,

211
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,473
living outside the APP,
but now she's back in text apolis in 

212
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,194
full princess the tire.
The cloud then represents the ultimate 

213
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:49,190
resistance to the system which has been 
brushed aside by the film and jeans.

214
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:53,650
Heroics have only served to perpetuate 
this cruel system is the ultimate of the

215
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,900
Emoji movie.
Resistance is futile,

216
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,950
were either subjugated by strict 
totalitarian regime or we get to express

217
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:00,784
ourselves freely,
so long as it serves the same master in 

218
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,404
either case,
freedom is an illusion and your 

219
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,680
inescapably a pawn in the system g you 
all,

220
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,390
and thanks for watching.
Peace.

221
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,520
Yes.
What we have business to attend to.

222
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,640
What kind of business monkey business.
British,

223
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,830
thanks for watching wise crack.
