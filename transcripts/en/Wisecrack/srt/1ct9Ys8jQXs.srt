1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,570
[inaudible] and violence cannot be 
assessed by headlines.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,763
Headlines are about things that happen 
and they give you no indication 

3
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:16,430
whatsoever of how common a particular 
activity as a cause.

4
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,160
You'd never see reporter standing 
outside a school saying,

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,320
I,
here I am in front of the Maplewood high

6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,730
school,
which hasn't been shot up today.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,933
Uh,
or here I am in the capital of 

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,840
Mozambican.
There's no civil war.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,570
So forget headlines.
You have to,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,433
the only way to answer the question of 
what are the trends in violence is to 

11
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:33,944
look at data where you count the number 
of occurrences as a proportion of the 

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,074
number of opportunities.
And you see whether that's changed over 

13
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:42,014
time.
So since I wrote better angels of our 

14
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:44,900
nature,
and,

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,020
uh,
I sent it off to the press in,

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,100
uh,
end of 2010.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,800
So the data that were available from 
Warfarin,

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
oh eight,
oh nine,

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,940
uh,
I keep yearly updates on what's happened

20
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:56,774
to those trends.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,733
And with the exception of civil war,
which after a rollercoaster downward 

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,890
from the end of World War II has shown 
something of an uptick,

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,810
uh,
because of the Syrian civil war,

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,883
it's wiped out about 13 years of 
progress taking us back to the level of 

25
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:13,850
luck,
2000 white,

26
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:16,670
it's still a fraction of the level that 
it was at in the 60s,

27
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:19,430
70s and 80s,
when you had not just,

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,440
uh,
uh,

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,550
eight or nine civil wars going on at a 
time,

30
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,020
but a 25 or 30,
uh,

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,750
we,
we tend to forget them.

32
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,490
We tend to be amnesic about,
uh,

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,353
all those nasty wars in Africa and 
Southeast Asia that were going on in 

34
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,530
the,
in the seventies and eighties.

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,500
But a lot of them had a considerable 
death tall.

36
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,110
So it's clearly things have gotten worse
in,

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,840
in Syria.
They've gotten worse in Ukraine and,

38
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,730
uh,
and um,

39
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,400
Pakistan,
but the global trend has not,

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,463
uh,
reverse the progress that we have seen 

41
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:49,454
by any means.

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,410
Then all the other trends such as 
homicide,

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,000
which kills far more people than wars,
uh,

44
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,720
continues to go down.
Sexual violence,

45
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,310
at least in countries that have good 
data,

46
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:00,740
have continued to go down.
Rape and domestic violence.

47
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:01,574
Child abuse has continued to go down 
more and more states and countries have 

48
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:09,371
abolished capital punishment,
even democratization of government.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,633
The absence of government violence where
we're aware of backsliding in countries 

50
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:16,820
like Venezuela and that Turkey and 
Russia,

51
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,283
but still the global trend continues to 
beat that the world is getting more 

52
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,254
democratic.
We don't read about the countries that 

53
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,590
have liberalized,
but we hear about the countries that are

54
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,290
increased their repression and that they
do exist.

55
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,124
But on the whole,
the world has become more democratic as 

56
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:31,640
well as less homicidal,
uh,

57
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,930
less,
um,

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,570
uh,
gender based violence,

59
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,820
less child abuse and so on.
And,

60
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,950
um,
even in the category of war,

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,040
you can divide wars into wars between 
countries.

62
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,103
Old fashioned wars of country,
a declares war on country B and civil 

63
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,440
wars.
And,

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,313
uh,
uh,

65
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,470
the first category,
interstate wars,

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,890
uh,
government on each side has been in,

67
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,783
um,
kind of sputtering decline for many 

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,430
decades.
Uh,

69
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,970
there are and fewer wars between 
countries.

70
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,650
The wars that exist are civil wars and,
um,

71
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,880
that has,
uh,

72
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,020
that record has continued to,
to,

73
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,590
um,
uh,

74
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,061
to,
uh,

75
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,960
to improve.
Uh,

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,230
namely,
we've had zero interstate wars since the

77
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,850
better angels of our nature was 
published.

78
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,830
And in fact,
we've had zero interstate wars since the

79
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,390
American invasion of Iraq in 2003.
And historically,

80
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,900
wars between countries tend to kill more
people than civil wars.

81
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,500
So even with the backsliding that we've 
seen in,

82
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,040
uh,
in the case of civil war,

83
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,260
in the case of the most destructive form
of wars,

84
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,950
the world is still not seeing a return 
today.

85
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,880
The battle days of the seventies and 
eighties.
