1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,030
There's a couple of guys,
uh,

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,040
for,
from,

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,190
from New York named Jozy Altidore,
he plays on the Olympic team,

4
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:17,620
plays for a full national team.
Uh,

5
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:18,454
he's a big guy.
I've gone up against them a few times 

6
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,064
and he's,
he's,

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,380
he's young in his decision making,
but,

8
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,360
uh,
you can see all the tools are there.

9
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,010
He's,
he's very humble.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,440
He's very willing to take advice.
He wants to learn.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,780
And so I think he's definitely a kid to 
watch.

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,940
Most people in soccer circles do know 
who he is.

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,700
So for all those people that maybe are 
on the fringes,

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,283
this is definitely a kid to watch.
Freddy Adu has been a guy who's been 

15
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:41,680
well documented.
Uh,

16
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:45,820
he left the league last year to join one
of the top clubs in Portugal and I think

17
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,010
it's been a great move for him.
He hasn't been playing a lot,

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,323
but it's like I couldn't think of 
anything better because now he's got to 

19
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:52,870
earn it.

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,080
He's in an environment where they don't 
care if he's already or do or not.

21
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,040
They see 20 freddy a dues,
you know,

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,130
all the time.
They probably have 20,

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,490
30 dudes on their team or they've been 
stars and now he's going to have to make

24
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,980
the adjustment where he's,
uh,

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,043
you know,
not the number one guy and there's not 

26
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,660
everybody telling him he's the best day 
in and day out and so he doesn't have to

27
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:12,700
work for it.
So now I'm excited for him.

28
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,534
I think,
uh,

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,700
during this they just had the Olympic 
qualifying tournament,

30
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,470
where are our boys qualified for the 
Olympics?

31
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:19,060
And I thought he played very,
very well.

32
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,430
Uh,
there's another two kids,

33
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,770
one's named Marissa do,
he plays up in Toronto,

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,140
went to Maryland,
he was rookie of the year last year.

35
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,720
He's very good.
He's got a lot of the tools.

36
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,310
I think the guy's a deer.

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,300
We can be running whatever distance and 
I don't think the guy sweats,

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,253
you know,
it's just,

39
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,520
I don't really think that's fair really.
But he is a specimen.

40
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:41,800
He's got a very good soccer,
but he needs another guy's very humble.

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,540
Uh,
he gets it.

42
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,830
And,
uh,

43
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,723
you know,
I think he's gonna be a very important 

44
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:48,580
part of our net full national team for a
long time.

45
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,860
And then we have another kid named Sasha
[inaudible].

46
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,540
He played for Chivas,
uh,

47
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,540
grew up in California.
Uh,

48
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,463
it's got a lot of personality,
but that comes out on the field and I 

49
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:01,330
think that kind of blend of being 
technical,

50
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:05,320
but also having a little bit of that 
flare a lends itself to our program very

51
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,390
well because I think that having those 
kinds of kids,

52
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,470
those are few and far between.
