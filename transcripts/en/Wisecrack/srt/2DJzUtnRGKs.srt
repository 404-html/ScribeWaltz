00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,270

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,193

4
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:27,030
installment that bravely made aunt may 
hot.

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,910
The film follows teenage earthling,
Peter Parker,

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,030
who is Hashtag blessed with sticky hand 
powers.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,620
One day Peter Fights for playboy 
billionaire Elon Musk in the civil war,

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,550
but before Ilan can ulysses s grant him 
a spot on the avengers.

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,443
Peter has to prove himself by just sort 
of stopping crime with no clear 

10
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:49,140
deadlines or goals.
Fortunately,

11
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:49,974
a garbage man named tombs has been busy 
selling artists and weapons on etsy and 

12
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,264
dressing like a bird.
Spiders sworn enemies behind water 

13
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,014
spouts at school.
Peter spends his time macking on his 

14
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,434
crush.
Liz chillin with is obligatory ugly fat 

15
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,640
friend,
Ned and macking on his crush.

16
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,750
Liz while chatting with is obligatory 
fat friend Ned afterschool.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,380
He looks for crime only.
Define New York City is too safe.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,140
That is until tombs is men forget their 
pin number and have to use a ray gun.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,440
They escape,
but Peter does manage to blow up a deli.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,430
Peter slings back home where ned learns 
Peter's deepest secret.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,730
He still plays with Legos.
Oh,

22
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,410
Andy Spiderman.
That too.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,890
When ned coyly implies Peter knows 
spiderman.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,833
He didn't know sweater man.
They score tickets to Liz's weeknight 

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,140
ranger,
but the party has cut short.

26
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,930
When tombs is men sell guns to childish 
Gumby.

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,943
Peter Mixes it up by using all the same 
tactics and gets dropped on his head 

28
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:47,994
like my son relax.
He was a baby armed with a ninth grade 

29
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,104
education.
Ned and Peter decrypted Doodad and Geo 

30
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:58,770
locate tunes to Washington DC,
the criminal capital of the universe.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,330
Peter gets a rematch with Birdman,
but ends up in an Amazon prime warehouse

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,060
where he hits it off with his ostp.

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,903
Samantha.
So where would you like to take me 

34
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,974
tonight?
It's really nice to have somebody to 

35
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,100
talk to.
Speaking of hitting it off,

36
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,963
ned turns the Doodad into a bomb causing
an explosion in the monument to 

37
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,224
Washington's penis.
Peter Saves his classmates heroically 

38
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:23,010
costing the taxpayers millions.
Back in the big apple store,

39
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,650
Peter Interrogates Childish Gumby 
without a warrant.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,513
Since this is America,
he tells him to check the ocean bus 

41
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,690
where tunes goes.
Rip Ship.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,230
Ilan glues the ship back together,
but takes back his suit.

43
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,280
Leaving Peter to walk home naked.
Peter Asks Liz to homecoming,

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,200
get it.
Of course you don't,

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,980
but when he gets to her house,
a shocking Pepsi twist is revealed.

46
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,190
Birdman is Liz's dad who's anti spider 
kill you and everybody love and pro gun.

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,033
Since it's act three,
Peter Decides to stop bird man's latest 

48
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,140
scheme,
robbing an airplane full of avengers.

49
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:58,974
Merge tombs tries the old,
I'm going to drop a building on your 

50
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
face trick,
but Peter Remembers he has super 

51
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,744
strength and thoughts is planned by 
crashing the plane into an area full of 

52
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,660
tourists having utterly reckless his 
life.

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,110
Peter says goodbye.
Ilan offers peter a job at tesla,

54
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,690
but peter declines.
Oh yeah.

55
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,524
Aunt may was in this spiderman 
homecoming marries the superhero action 

56
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,730
shondra and the teen comedy genre with a
license at got online.

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,790
The film is stylized like John Hughes 
Jones,

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,833
both through homages to Ferris Bueller 
doesn't go to college pretty in Pinko 

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,153
and the one about breakfast and through 
its themes of teenagers exploring 

60
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,390
identity,
romance,

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,253
and hats,
it gives me confidence through the lens 

62
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,044
of a kid growing up.
The film updates the Sony Spiderman 

63
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,420
ethos with great power comes great 
responsibility and 10 more reboots.

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,260
Usually this is interpreted as meaning 
that since Peter has great power,

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,470
he has the obligation to use it for the 
utmost good of society.

66
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,543
But homecoming inverts this by 
questioning whether the young Peter is 

67
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,690
responsible enough to wield great power.
I know anything.

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,593
What do you want me to do?

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,643
I think you've done in the beginning,
Peter is impulsive and fails to think 

70
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,680
through the consequences of his use of 
power,

71
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,723
not so different from the criminals who 
sell nuclear weapons to people without 

72
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,384
conducting a background check.
He considers using his power for 

73
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,851
frivolous means such as crashing Liz's 
party as Spiderman for the gram and jail

74
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:26,560
breaking his suit before reading up on 
Windows Vista.

75
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,240
His father figure Ilan has to repeatedly
swoop in and clean up his mess,

76
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,283
usually in a tesla,
ultimately taking away a suit so he can 

77
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:35,794
dry clean it.
It's only when Peter realizes that his 

78
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,840
actions make things explode all the time
that he grows up.

79
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,050
Ironically realizing he is not ready to 
wield such power until the sql spiderman

80
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:49,930
home depot.
In a note of intertextual irony,

81
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:50,764
Michael Keaton appears as an avian 
villain on the heels of 2014 Oscar 

82
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,260
Darling Birdman or the unexpected value 
of shooting off your nose in it.

83
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,610
Keaton's character falls into obscurity 
after starring in a superhero franchise,

84
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,760
much as Keaton did after his starring 
role in Batman,

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,953
although who could forget Jack Frost,
literally every human after they 

86
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,874
lobotomized it from their brains.
This role becomes an ironic completion 

87
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,134
of Birdman and that the film made Keaton
relevant enough to return to lucrative 

88
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,334
franchises and play the underdog to mega
stars like Robert Downey Jr and 16 time 

89
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,710
Oscar winner Zendaya for earthlink 
cinema.

90
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,650
I'm Garrick's wormy Lloyd and a case you
hadn't heard.

91
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:36,940
