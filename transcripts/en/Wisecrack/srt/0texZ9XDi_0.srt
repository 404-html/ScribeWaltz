1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,930
Benign Causes Depression and anxiety.
I learned about a bit less connections.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,343
There were few that were really 
challenging for me because I realized 

3
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:16,560
how much I recognize them in myself.
So one of the hardest,

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,900
I'll tell you a story about something 
else first,

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:23,660
but when I was in 2009 on Christmas Eve,
it makes it even sadder.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,840
The story happened on Christmas Eve,
so I used to live on junk food.

7
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,090
I used to eat appallingly and on 
Christmas Eve,

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,924
2009,
I went into my local KFC at lunchtime 

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,430
and I turned up and I gave my order,
which is so disgusting.

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,260
I can't even repeat it.
And the guy behind the counter said,

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,830
are Johann so glad you're here.
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,320
It was like,
okay,

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,770
so you walked off and he came back with 
all the other staff and they bought me a

14
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:51,771
massive Christmas card and they'd 
written it to our best customer and so I

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,600
was looking at this and my heart sank.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,870
I thought,
this isn't even the fried chicken shop.

17
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,380
I come to the most.
It was very unfortunate that low point,

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,920
but we all know,
right?

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,913
Junk food has taken over our diet.
It's not admittedly to the extreme the 

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,440
eyebrows,
but junk food is increasingly dominating

21
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,210
our diets and it's making us physically 
sick.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,820
One thing that really shocked me in the 
research is that there's.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,793
There's really good evidence.
There's something similar has happened 

24
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:18,354
with our minds,
but I kind of junk values have taken 

25
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,580
over our minds and they've made us 
mentally sick,

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,040
but the thousands of years now,
philosophers have said,

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,820
if you think life is about money and 
status and and showing off,

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,743
you're going to feel terrible right?
From Confucius on down people that 

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,773
rewarding is that,
but weirdly nobody had actually 

30
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:40,980
scientifically investigated it until an 
incredible man.

31
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,510
I got to know your professor,
Tim Kasser,

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,900
who's at Knox University in Illinois,
so professor cass a new.

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,500
When it comes to human motivation,
this basically,

34
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,750
to put it crudely,
two kinds of human motivation,

35
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,700
right?
Imagine you play the piano.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,133
If you play the piano in the morning 
because you love it and it gives you 

37
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:00,570
joy,
that's an intrinsic motivation.

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,640
You're not doing it to get something out
a bit.

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,110
You're just doing it because that thing 
gives you joy right now.

40
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,200
Imagine you play the piano not because 
it gives you joy,

41
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,034
but in a dive bar to pay the rent or 
because your parents are really 

42
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,624
pressuring you to be a piano maestro or 
I'd know to impress a man might be some 

43
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,510
weird piano fetishist,
right?

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,230
That would be an extrinsic reasons to 
play the piano.

45
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,880
You're not doing it for the experience 
itself.

46
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,160
You're doing it to get something out.
You're doing it at one remove.

47
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:31,080
You're doing it to get something out of 
the experience.

48
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,350
Now we're all a mixture of intrinsic and
extrinsic values obviously,

49
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,184
and we change throughout our lives,
but professor cass discovered some 

50
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:41,550
really fascinating things.
The first thing is the more your life is

51
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,670
dominated by extrinsic values,
the more you're doing things,

52
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:45,504
not because you think they're important,
but because of how you'll look to other 

53
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,010
people,
how you're seem on the outside,

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,460
the more likely you are to become 
depressed and anxious.

55
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,294
It's a quite significant effect.
Has Been found in 22 studies with 

56
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:59,110
depression and 14 studies with anxiety.
Now,

57
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,550
there are many reasons.
I'll give you just one.

58
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,140
One of the things we know is that 
something that's a real source of joy in

59
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:09,390
human life since really necessary have 
what are called flow states right there.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,860
Moments when you're doing something you 
really love.

61
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,300
For me,
it's writing for someone else.

62
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,020
It might be running.

63
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,760
It's definitely not that for me or you 
know,

64
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,060
whatever.
Uh,

65
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,063
when you time seems to collapse,
you're totally in the moment of what 

66
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,260
you're doing and you're just,
you're flowing right?

67
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,623
Extreme extrinsic values massively 
disrupt your ability to get into flow 

68
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,050
states.
Imagine you're playing the piano.

69
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,520
Imagine the guys playing the piano for 
intrinsic reasons,

70
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,810
right?
Because it gives them joy.

71
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,883
Now imagine suddenly has to think,
am I the best piano player in New York 

72
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,200
City today?
Who's better than me?

73
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,270
How are these people listening to me?
How are they judging me?

74
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,480
Am I going to get paid for this?
You can see how it would jolt you out of

75
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,410
the flow state,
right?

76
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,810
When you think extrinsically,
you get jolted out of flow state,

77
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,853
there are many reasons why extrinsic 
values make us feel bad and they ruin 

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,190
the quality of your relationships.
They crowd out intrinsic values.

79
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,023
There's all sorts of things going on,
but press castles also showing that 

80
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,980
extrinsic values have been taking over 
our culture.

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,310
We are becoming more and more dominated 
by these extrinsic values.

82
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,383
This we are immersed in this way of 
thinking for the moment we're born more 

83
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,350
18 month old children recognize the 
Mcdonald's m,

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,193
the know that own surname.
We are pickled in advertising messages 

85
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,920
telling us that life is about living 
extrinsically,

86
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,390
right?
Imagine an advert that told you,

87
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,400
you know what?
You're great.

88
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,680
You look fine.
You smell nice,

89
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,500
you're amazing.
You don't need anything more today.

90
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,810
That would be the worst advert that ever
been done.

91
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,644
Right?
Advertising is the ultimate frenemy is 

92
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,900
always telling you,
oh babe,

93
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,160
I love you.
It's just,

94
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:36,994
you know,
didn't stink right now what professor 

95
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:43,030
Castillo's showed as he puts it is at 
some level we all know this,

96
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,690
right?

97
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,523
Everyone watching this knows you're not 
going to lie on the on the last day of 

98
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,704
your life.
You will not lie there and think about 

99
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,490
all the things you bought,
right?

100
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,570
You will not think about all the hours 
you put in at the office.

101
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,940
You will think about moments of deep 
meaning and connection,

102
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,963
but as professor Cassar puts it,
we live in a machine that is constantly 

103
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:04,300
diverting us from what is meaningful 
about life.

104
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,600
There's a wonderful experiment is done 
before Professor Castle's work,

105
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:11,150
but I think it really illustrates this 
and it was done.

106
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,970
Nineteen 78.
It's really simple experiment.

107
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:16,060
You get a lot of five year olds and you 
put them in a sandpit and you split them

108
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:16,894
into two groups.
The first group is shown to 

109
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,670
advertisements for specific toy.
Whatever the 19,

110
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,740
78 equivalent of peppa pig was,
right,

111
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,963
and the second group is shown show no 
adverts and at the end of it they give 

112
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,230
all the kids a choice.

113
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,630
They said,
okay,

114
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,463
kids go choice.
Now you can either play with a nice boy 

115
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,413
who doesn't have the toy from the out of
it or you can play with a nasty boy 

116
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,194
who's got the toy.
The kids who didn't see the ad mostly 

117
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,720
choose the nice boy without the toy and 
the kids who saw the ad,

118
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,580
mostly twos,
the nasty boy who's got the toy,

119
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,680
so just to advertisements to prime those
children to choose and inanimate lump of

120
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:51,514
plastic over kindness and connection.
We are all being driven by way more 

121
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,890
advertising than that everyday,
right?

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
Anyone watching this and I would include
myself in that,

123
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:00,794
he stayed late at work,
do something they don't want to do to 

124
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,960
buy something they don't need rather 
than go be home with their kids.

125
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:06,794
Maybe you've fallen prey to that dynamic
and professor Kessler has really shown 

126
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,030
this way that we've got to.
We've got to unpick these junk values,

127
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,050
these junk values,
what we've been fed for so long.

128
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,890
There are kind of KFC for the soul and 
they're making us feel terrible.
