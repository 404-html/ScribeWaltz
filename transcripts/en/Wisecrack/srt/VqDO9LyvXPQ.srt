00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,571
Hey,
wise,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,404
crack jared again.
Today we're talking about a film that 

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,520
everyone's loving and nobody's watching.
Blade runner 20,

4
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,140
49.
The central question,

5
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,650
the original blade runner poses is what 
makes us human.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,920
The cul continues to meditate on the 
importance of this question,

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,140
but instead of retreading the same 
brown,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,003
it proposes something new that is 
essential to our humanity and how does 

9
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,054
it do this with holographic?
Why foods and weird avant garde 

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,280
literature.
Welcome list wise,

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,940
crack quick.
Take our blade runner.

12
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:31,870
20,
49.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,660
Major spoilers ahead.
First,

14
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:35,494
a recap.
After the events of the original blade 

15
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,074
runner,
the world freaked out and banned the 

16
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:41,190
production of replicants.
However,

17
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,024
tensions eventually cool and a new 
company starts to produce replicants 

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,910
that to quote Rick Sanchez has zero 
chance of going blade runner 20,

19
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:49,744
49 follows k,
a replicant hunting blade runner and 

20
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:55,390
replicant himself.
He discovers the skeleton of a replicant

21
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:59,590
that shows signs of having given birth,
which should be impossible.

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,480
K sent in search of the trial replicant 
and discovers the father is a certain Mr

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,170
Decker,
informed by a childhood memory case,

24
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,004
suspects that he is deckards miracle 
child that would start the replicant 

25
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:15,160
revolution except ease,
not the memory was implanted by deckards

26
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:15,994
real daughter,
confined the reunites with her mean old 

27
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,950
ad.
The 1982 classic largely reflects on how

28
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:21,784
attachment to memories both for mankind 
and replicants defines our humanity 

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,913
replicants,
recite poetry and ask all the 

30
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:29,014
philosophical questions while we're 
shown debase humans who are all drunk 

31
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,454
and disease.
All this serves to further blur the 

32
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,960
distinction between human and replicant.
Twenty,

33
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:41,794
49 explores this fuzzy,
replicant human distinction in another 

34
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:48,700
way with intimacy and physical 
connection or rather the lack of it.

35
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,020
The only real relationship k experiences
is with his holographic girlfriend.

36
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:57,520
Joy K tries to make their relationship 
more real by uploading her to a portable

37
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,354
projector,
allowing her to free roam in one of the 

38
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,550
weirder scenes,
joy projects her image onto a prostitute

39
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,100
so they can physically touch.

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,390
The desire for intimacy is subtly 
implanted all throughout the film.

41
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,240
Neander wallace,
the creator of the new replicants,

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,420
must feel and touch everything due to 
his blindness.

43
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,403
Deckards daughter is locked in an 
isolation chamber and unable to touch 

44
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:21,094
the holograms that keep her entertained.
There's also a recurring motif of 

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,800
feeling precipitation,
as I'll call it.

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
Joy going outside for the first time 
reaches out to feel the rain,

47
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,043
but it goes right through her replicants
wear gloves all throughout the film 

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,120
until k removes his own to feel the 
touch of falling snow earlier.

49
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,430
Case outstretched hand is covered in 
bees,

50
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,323
although to be honest,
I'm a little less sure about what the 

51
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:45,724
bees represent.
We also see a group of orphans 

52
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:50,290
collectively touch k when he shows up to
find the replicant.

53
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:54,670
Child and Hologram Elvis sings,
take my hand from his song,

54
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:57,340
can't help falling in love after deckerd
in KP,

55
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:58,360
the hell out of each other.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,960
The film's shot shows decker trying to 
touch his daughter,

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,990
but they're obstructed by a glass wall.
Through this,

58
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,160
the importance of touch and connection 
is seen as innately human.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,350
The second way,
20,

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,500
49 explores the human replicant 
distinction is in its exploration of how

61
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,550
memory builds our personal narrative and
how fallible that is.

62
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,443
See,
this is really interesting because 

63
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,214
whereas the original blade runner showed
replicants making claims to humanity 

64
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,420
with memories.
20,

65
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,500
49 goes further.
Implying memories alone aren't enough.

66
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,483
You might remember the bizarre 
post-trauma stress test k has to go 

67
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,024
through twice.
He sits in a barren room where a 

68
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,120
disembodied voice keeps saying stuff 
about a system of cells while k responds

69
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,450
with words like interlinked cells and 
dreadfully.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,180
This test has ripped straight from 
Vladimir Nabokov,

71
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
book Pale Fire.
The full excerpt is a system of cells 

72
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,240
interlinked within cells,
interlinked within cells,

73
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,870
interlinked within one step and 
dreadfully distinct against the dark.

74
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,703
A Tall White Fountain played later.
We actually see Pale fire in k's 

75
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,730
apartment.
Enjoy,

76
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,564
asked him to read it.
The premise of Pale fire is essentially 

77
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,834
that you've got a poem by a fictional 
author being analyzed in the footnotes 

78
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:09,904
by a fictional commentator.
It's a book about a commentary about a 

79
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,870
poem.
Essentially books,

80
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,260
the whole cells interlinked.
Passage details are fictional poet.

81
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,040
Having a heart attack and seeing a 
vision of a tall white fountain.

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,933
Later in the poem he reads about someone
else having a near death experience and 

83
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:28,804
seeing the same white fountain convinced
that this shared vision proves the 

84
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,094
existence of an afterlife.
The poet investigates further only to 

85
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,904
discover the line was a misprint and the
person actually said White Mountain 

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,613
sensing a theme here.
These narratives that we build around 

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,060
objects and memories is at the heart of 
20,

88
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,894
49 discussion on what makes a human case
memory of a wooden horse leads him to 

89
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:56,221
believe that he is this miracle child,
but surprise he isn't.

90
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,940
They're not his memories,
their implants.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,290
Just as the fictional poet of Pale 
fires,

92
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,750
revelation is shattered after realizing 
the white fountain was a misprint.

93
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,610
Kay's revelation is shattered after 
realizing beat miss imprint of a memory,

94
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,683
and this is where the themes of intimacy
and memory combined when he's given the 

95
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,720
choice to help the resistance by killing
deckerd,

96
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,900
he refuses.
Instead of trusting his memories,

97
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,070
he puts his faith in the intimacy and 
physical connection he yearns for.

98
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,030
Thus,
he lets this not memory guide him to his

99
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,864
decision to reunite deckerd and his 
daughter and just like the original 

100
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,630
blade runner,
a replicant disobeys,

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,473
his programming to save a life,
thus achieving meaning and maybe even a 

102
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,730
soul.
There is so much more we could say about

103
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:50,200
the thematic connections between 20,
49 and pale fire like parental loss,

104
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,530
the need for memorial or even just the 
line father time.

105
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,140
All gray and bent emerged with is uneasy
dog,

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,213
which sounds lot like deckerd and his 
furry companion plus what's up with all 

107
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,574
the water imagery,
the cell imagery there a lot more to 

108
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:05,144
unpack here,
so let us know what you think in the 

109
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,854
comments and maybe we'll do an earthling
cinema or a true philosophy up until 

110
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,810
next time.
Thanks for watching.

111
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,730
Peace.
Thanks for watching.

112
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,564
Wise crack.
If you want to dive further into blade 

113
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,000
runner 20,
49,

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,560
you should definitely hit up our 
friends,

115
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,140
Eric and Philip over at the new 
rockstars channel.

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,020
Think of a movie show or trailer that 
you've seen.

117
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,190
All right.
You got it.

118
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,870
Well,
they've definitely analyzed it.

119
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,943
They've got an awesome video on the 
soundtrack of baby driver that breaks 

120
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,960
down how Edgar Wright creates an action 
musical.

121
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,680
They've also got some really cool videos
analyzing the movie it and breakdowns of

122
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,500
every single episode of this past season
of game of thrones,

123
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,590
and if you're into all the stuff we've 
been making in want to help us do more,

124
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,424
consider becoming a patron.
We've got a growing library of patron 

125
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,020
only content,
including the legendary,

126
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:48,854
too hot for Youtube,
eight bit philosophy video podcast on 

127
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,970
wonder woman and the Matrix evolutions,
a new video on the movie it and more.

128
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,680
We're working on more patron exclusives 
each month,

129
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,980
like early access to upcoming videos.
Quick takes and much more.
