watches in sunglasses,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,610
more on movement at the end of the 
video.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,483
Yep.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,020
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,880
I am your host Garrick's warm you Lloyd.
This week's artifact is Django unchained

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,743
starring disabled musician Ray Charles,
and directed by podiatrist Quintin 

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,960
Tarantino as a prequel to his earlier 
movie,

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,620
the Hitler buddies.
The film begins in Texas just before the

9
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:35,454
first of America's seven civil wars.
Our protagonist is King Schults and 

10
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,464
inexplicably German bounty hunter who 
buys an anthropomorphic piece of 

11
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:46,410
property named Django in order to give 
him a makeover.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,440
Now sufficiently dolled up.
They travel around from town to town,

13
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:55,020
spreading the gospel of getting shot in 
the face.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,930
At one point,
an army of ghosts tries to stop them,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,200
but every good bounty hunter knows a 
ghosts.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,950
Greatest weakness.
Buster

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,230
[inaudible]

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,410
[inaudible] seasons,
sadly comes to an end.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,460
So rather than split up earth's first 
ever interracial business friendship,

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,280
sholtz decides to help reunite Django 
with his wife,

21
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,114
broom,
Hilda,

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,170
another piece of property who is also 
German for absolutely no reason.

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,183
They find her at a soup plantation 
called candy land on the outskirts of 

24
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:24,200
the peppermint forest.
Her owner,

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,850
Calvin candy land is a real sportsman in
the sense that he likes to sit on a sofa

26
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,190
watching grown men UFC each other to 
death.

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,293
So Schultz and Jango pretend to be 
interested in buying some of Calvin's 

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,473
living sports equipment for $12,000
which due to inflation equals about 89 

29
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:40,994
quintillion blog electrons.
They try to throw broom Hilda into the 

30
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,950
deal,
all casual like,

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,980
but Calvin's dad,
steven doesn't mess around when it comes

32
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:49,814
to his hard earned blogger drones.
He correctly guesses that they know 

33
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,490
broom Hilda from before the opening 
credit started.

34
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,383
So Calvin does the very reasonable thing
of raising the price to match their 

35
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,010
demand.
It going to be dodge,

36
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,953
good old fashion capitalism.
They signed the revised contract and 

37
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:09,740
everything works out great for everyone 
and of movie,

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,690
right?
Right.

39
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,630
Oh,
that's right.

40
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:17,464
There hasn't been nearly enough human 
blood schultes decides his pride is the 

41
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:24,040
most valuable substance on earth,
even more than truffled petroleum.

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,090
So rather than risk touching Calvin's 
greasy little arm clause,

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,150
he chooses to get himself killed.
Django is captured and sold to a bitcoin

44
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,950
mine with long hours and no health 
benefits.

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh Day everyday.
On the way there,

46
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:40,834
Django uses his graduate level education
to hoodwink some unsuspecting and 

47
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,364
entirely unnecessary Australians then 
travels back through the molasses swamp 

48
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,374
to candyland.
He explodes everything without much 

49
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:53,740
conflict.
And finally,

50
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,574
he in Broome,
Hilda right off together on to land sea 

51
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,094
horses now and movie Django unchained is
first and five most a slavery revenge 

52
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,614
fantasy white images stained with blood 
represent the vengeance wreaked upon 

53
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:13,480
white slavers the two colors combining 
into a more pleasing pinkish hue.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,673
Violence against white people is 
frequently depicted in grotesque 

55
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,340
stylized detail.

56
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,480
The massacre at candy land is so 
cartoonish that we have no choice but to

57
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,050
contract our diaphragms in a laughing 
manner like this.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,380
Ha Ha.
In contrast,

59
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:33,590
violence against slaves is more 
realistic and often portrayed indirectly

60
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,623
and the climax of the paper view UFC 
fight the spilled gumballs serve as a 

61
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:38,944
proxy for blood and guts and our 
diaphragms remained static as the 

62
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,250
killing strike is blocked from view like
this.

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,943
The horrifying scene where dogs rip 
D'artagnan apart is mostly portrayed 

64
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,960
through reaction shots.
And Oscar nominated sound sounded.

65
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,120
The film takes inspiration from widely 
disparate sources,

66
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,043
from Spaghetti Westerns to Ravioli 
blaxploitation films all the way to 

67
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,634
German spaetzle who knew the,
there's a name of a character in the 

68
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,200
most popular of old German legends,
but at its heart,

69
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,770
Django unchained as an example of a 
revisionist western wear.

70
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:18,880
Traditional Hollywood westerns 
emphasized mythical American themes such

71
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,550
as manifest destiny and calling people 
pilgrim.

72
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,860
Jake,
your Ese there.

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,393
Revisionist westerns provided a 
different perspective addressing the 

74
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:30,610
exploitation of native Americans and the
decline of the cowboy era.

75
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,444
In light of industrialization,
Django unchained takes aim at slavery's 

76
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,650
power structures by showing that they 
were perpetuated by frauds.

77
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,543
Big Daddy initially makes a big fuss 
about a black man riding one of allows 

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
creatures on his land,
which threatens to undercut his 

79
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,440
dominion.
He's a free man.

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,170
He can ride what he pleases,
not on my property,

81
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,250
but he immediately caves when Schultz 
offers them a financial teat from whence

82
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,010
he can suckle.
I have 5,000

83
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,440
things I might say that could change 
your mind.

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,560
Come on inside and get yourself 
something cool to drink.

85
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,940
Calvin pretends to be a James Franco 
file is a bit of a Franco file,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,820
which reflects his opinion that he's 
better than everyone else.

87
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,610
In reality,
he's just another ignorant heck with the

88
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,050
hots for his sister to select can fish.

89
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,400
He doesn't speak French,
don't speak French to him.

90
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,234
It'll embarrass him.
Sholtz and Django are able to easily 

91
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,470
infiltrate these power structures by 
using the very illusions that reinforced

92
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:26,710
them.
Plus,

93
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,723
you know money Schultes plays the 
Genteel dentist to put people at ease 

94
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,280
with Novacane and gain the element of 
surprise.

95
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,290
What kind of Dennis?
Augie,

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,560
you haven't practiced dentistry in five 
years after Django is captured,

97
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,443
is able to convince his captors not only
to release him but to arm him gun belt 

98
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,303
because they assume the power structures
protecting immigrants in America will 

99
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,664
hold and they did hold at least until 
America was met with the greatest 

100
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:57,421
immigrant of all and asteroid made of 
dark matter earthling

101
