1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,473
In order to be successful,
people often think they have to 

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,174
constantly be achieving,
constantly going from one thing to the 

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,230
next,
crossing things off of their to do list.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,363
But as a consequence,
they're not in the present moment and 

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
their productivity would be so much 
greater if they stayed present as well 

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:22,914
as their performance on their tasks.
What's Morris that their relationships 

7
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:26,964
would improve drastically.
So what research on charisma shows is 

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,504
that highly charismatic people are 
people who are able to be so fully 

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,990
present with other people.
And that's what leads to that incredible

10
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,180
connection.
And that influence that they have.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,220
A research shows that our mind actually 
wanders about 50% of the time.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,270
And research also shows that when our 
mind is wandering,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,360
we are never as happy as when our mind 
is in the present moment.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,570
So if your mind is in the future 
worrying about something that's going to

15
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,404
happen or in the past because you're 
regretting something or angry at 

16
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,210
somebody,
um,

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,640
you're more likely to feel more negative
emotions.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,070
But when you're in the present moment,
even if you're doing a task,

19
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,910
you don't particularly like,
um,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,740
you'll actually feel happier.
But also a,

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,613
what we know is that you'll be able to 
be more productive when you're in that 

22
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,450
state because you're going to naturally 
be focused.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,583
One way that you can start to bring your
mind back into the present given its 

24
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,004
tendency to wander is um,
through breathing exercises and 

25
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,610
relaxation exercises.
So pure relax your body,

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,713
your mind will naturally start to settle
down and breathing is a very effective 

27
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,194
way to do that and very quickly.
So meditation practices can really help 

28
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:37,830
you observe your mind,
become aware of its tendencies,

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,870
for example,
its tendency to wander and um,

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,783
help you through that awareness.
Shift your attention back into the 

31
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,354
present moment.
Meditation is an exercise in which you 

32
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,100
are engaging fully with the present 
moment.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,253
So if it's a fantastic way to train your
mind to be more present with what is 

34
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,440
going on right now,
we currently are in a time and age where

35
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,274
multitasking has just become the norm.
We're constantly being pinged by our 

36
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,160
devices.
We're constantly receiving emails.

37
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:05,994
And all day long.
It's as if we were being interrupted 

38
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,103
from our stream stream of thought.
What's more is that we interrupt 

39
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,464
ourselves so we will interrupt what we 
are doing to check our phones for 

40
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,990
example.
So multitasking,

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,360
however,
it's very draining on our system.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,830
Our attention is constantly in demand.
It's as if you were,

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,480
you're working on 12 different things at
the same time.

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,590
You can't give your all to one of those 
things with meditation practices.

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,760
You can really train your mind to be 
more present and um,

46
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,170
help you to,
you know,

47
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:39,450
stay on task with what is going on.

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,273
Our research shows that people who 
meditate can increase their attention 

49
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,870
span.
In fact,

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,123
in some research studies,
we use a task called the attentional 

51
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,414
blink task in which you show people a 
number of different images in very fast 

52
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:58,950
sequence and usually we would only pick 
up every fourth image.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
We don't actually see the others.
That's why we call it the attentional 

54
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,530
blink.
Well,

55
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,260
research has shown that after meditation
retreat,

56
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,770
people tend to not show that attentional
blink or to show it less.

57
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,920
It just very interesting.
It means that if we call him our mind,

58
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,590
were somehow able to pick up things 
better in our environment,

59
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,573
which also makes sense in terms of how 
divided our mind is with regards to 

60
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,510
multitasking and so forth.
When our mind is very settled,

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,190
then we're able to literally see more 
things register more.
