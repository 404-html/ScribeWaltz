00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,960
This video is brought to you by 
skillshare.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,520
What's up guys?
Jared again.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,473
Today we're talking about one of the 
most nuanced takes on geek culture out 

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,890
there.
The Big Bang theory.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,230
Yep.
Nope,

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,610
not even close.
It's bad.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,500
Like really bad.
In fact,

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,680
it's become somewhat of a recurring gag 
for us to hate on this show,

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,860
so when you sadistic maniacs asked for 
what went wrong,

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,440
we reached out to one of our unfortunate
writers,

11
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,274
Thomas,
but instead of making this poor bastard 

12
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:36,640
watch all 5,000,
175 minutes of this show,

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,940
we just hopped on imdv and grabbed the 
top 10 rated episodes.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,833
Sorry,
we cannot afford to pay this man's 

15
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,600
therapist,
but I digress.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,583
Why is a show that deals with science,
comics and all that good wise crack 

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,720
stuff so bad?
Well,

18
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:54,340
after hours of grueling research,
we suspect it might have something to do

19
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:56,110
with references,
so it's subtle.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,033
The fate of doctor who's Tardis will be 
decided by a game of thrones inspired 

21
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,250
death match on the battlefield of 
thunder cats versus transformers.

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,210
See,
the Big Bang theory isn't just bad.

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,223
It's profoundly bad.
It's so bad that it requires philosophy 

24
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:12,544
to understand just how bad it is,
so join me as I attempt to convince you 

25
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:19,540
that the Big Bang theory is proof that 
meaning is dead,

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,230
woken Louis wise crack addition on the 
Big Bang theory,

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,050
what went wrong and big.
Shout out to the real MVP,

28
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:26,884
Thomas for watching this garbage.
The Big Bang theory loves 

29
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:30,334
referentiality.
They referenced cornerstones of nerd 

30
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:37,201
culture like star Trek.
Sheldon's log three,

31
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,654
four,
five point three for Battlestar 

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,930
Galactica.
That's my original series,

33
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:42,764
battlestar Galactica flight suit,
and even scientific facts and 

34
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:49,940
mathematical formulas.
They're slipped in to remind us over and

35
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:52,010
over again that Leonard,
Sheldon,

36
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,190
and company are diehard nerds.
They buy comics,

37
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,024
perform science experiments,
and sometimes described very basic 

38
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:01,370
things like slipping in a bathtub like 
this.

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,343
Not Surprising.
You have no safety math or adhesive 

40
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:07,630
stickers to allow for purchase on the 
surface with a low coefficient of static

41
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,464
friction.

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,760
Now,
in case you missed the laugh track,

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,390
sheldon giving penny,
the definition of friction was the joke.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,510
You see?
It's funny because it's a reference now.

45
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,720
If you're wondering why you feel a bit 
cheated at the punchline here,

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,470
it's probably because that definition of
friction was simply slotted in there and

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,323
the other scientific statement about the
nature of reality feels like it could 

48
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,860
have had the same effect here,
like gravity for instance,

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,490
and cue the next job.
I got to go to the emergency room.

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,870
Well,
let's say when you're correct,

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,380
did you write humorous is no longer 
seated in the glenoid socket?

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,223
I would certainly think so.
They could have replaced the word 

53
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,714
humorous and glenoid socket with 
jibberish and most wouldn't know the 

54
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,740
difference and that's the problem.
The actual science isn't the job,

55
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,780
but the fact that they're talking about 
science is friction isn't funny.

56
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,763
V referenced to friction is funny.
By contrast considered this brief 

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,200
futurama reference.
For somebody who barely understands math

58
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,034
like me,
the reference will probably evade 

59
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,283
detection,
but for those who spot the symbol for 

60
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,020
all if know the mathematical symbol for 
an infinite sense of countable numbers,

61
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,920
they'll realize that theater is implying
there's an infinite number of screens.

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,560
This not only gives an Easter egg for 
the mathematically inclined,

63
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,394
but more importantly,
the joke is the impossibilities of a 

64
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,360
movie theater having infinite screens.
The joke is about the subject of all,

65
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,640
if no,
not the mere reference to it.

66
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,580
The reference imbues the joke with 
additional meaning,

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,760
whereas the Big Bang theory accomplishes
the opposite.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,310
Leonard,
do you recall what I said?

69
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,263
I was going to revolutionize humanities 
understanding of the Higgs Boson 

70
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,200
particle,
and you said,

71
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,160
sheldon,
it's 2:00

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,993
AM.
Get Out of my bedroom.

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,720
These jokes are at best lazy writing and
at worst,

74
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,380
a small step toward the complete 
annihilation of reality.

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,730
Yes,
might sound extreme,

76
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,564
but these kinds of references with no 
subject is exactly what kept French 

77
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:01,040
philosopher John Beaudry yard up at 
night to Baudrillard.

78
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,240
We're living in a state where reality 
has been,

79
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,133
oh,
biliterate.

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,520
He gives four levels of representation.
The first level is like a picture,

81
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,160
a perfectly accurate representation of 
reality.

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,610
The second level of representation is 
the unfaithful copy.

83
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,480
A filter that makes you look prettier,
thus obscuring your actual face.

84
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,463
Below.
That is the third level of 

85
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,130
representation.
One that deliberately hide the fact that

86
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:26,730
there's no reality being represented 
like an artist's rendering of you,

87
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:30,660
where they've never actually seen you,
and finally the fourth level is reserved

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,583
for when signs and representations start
referencing other signs and 

89
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:38,520
representations and all sense of reality
is thrown out the window.

90
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,603
This is when people start photoshopping 
a photoshop image or making memes of 

91
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:44,064
other memes in butchery.
Art's eyes were already living in a 

92
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,034
world controlled by a system of fourth 
order Simulacra or any reference to the 

93
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,624
original reality is lost,
which might explain why he technically 

94
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:57,660
considers our reality a simulation.
Now,

95
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:58,494
if we're being optimistic,
the Big Bang theory is a distorted view 

96
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:04,890
of real nerd culture.
The second order of representation,

97
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,180
it gets a lot of the details wrong,
but it's still about real nerd culture,

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,390
but if we're being pessimistic and oh,
we are,

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,950
it's a show about nerd culture that has 
no relation to reality whatsoever.

100
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,510
Beathard order of representation,
a copy of something that never existed.

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,620
It has science without actual science.
It's about nerd culture.

102
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:27,570
Without real nerds.
They're more like,

103
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,820
what?
Someone who has never met an nerd thinks

104
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:30,654
they're like,
that's where the bad science references 

105
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:35,070
become relevant to beaudry art more 
often than not.

106
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,993
Jokes rely on characters.
Cramming in whatever scientific 

107
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:42,770
explanation is relevant to the action 
when our roadways most slippery now.

108
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:43,950
Okay.
There are three answers,

109
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,843
none of which are correct.
The correct answer is when covered by a 

110
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,054
film of liquid sufficient to reduce the 
coefficient of static friction between 

111
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,960
the tire and the road to essentially 
zero,

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,540
but not so deep as to introduce a new 
source of friction

113
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,623
references for the sake of references.
Jokes that don't rely on any 

114
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:05,710
understanding of the science,
but rather these simple recognition that

115
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,544
this is a scientific reference.
It's the difference between sheldon 

116
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:11,380
explaining how locks work when pennies 
locked out.

117
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Damn key out.
It's not surprising that Baldwin lock on

118
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,250
your door uses traditional edge mountain
cylinders.

119
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,200
Whereas the key for your Volkswagen uses
a center cylinder system

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,790
and when Leila and the professor are 
racing and drama,

121
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,190
Nah,
half a lap,

122
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,283
you forgotten the mobius strip to lapse 
is one lap your kids and your topology 

123
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,613
in the former.
The joke doesn't rely on an audience 

124
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,224
understanding how locks actually work.
The reality is irrelevant as long as we 

125
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,950
recognize that sheldon is being 
unnecessarily smart.

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,023
Whereas in future trauma,
we're laughing at the actual science 

127
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,370
referenced in the joke for Beaudry art.
As things progress,

128
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,030
these copies of reality end up becoming 
their own reality,

129
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,223
and this is where we see boatyards 
dismal vision reflected in the Big Bang 

130
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,664
theory.
These copies divorced from reality 

131
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,460
either partly or entirely signal,
not only the death of meaning,

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,353
but make all ideas interchangeable 
because the jokes in the show are 

133
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:12,944
apropos of nothing.
The characters can essentially spew 

134
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:19,370
meaningless nonsense under the guise of 
a meaningful job like in the shows game,

135
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,204
mystic warlords of Qa,
which starts as a kind of joke about 

136
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:25,100
magic.
The gathering in visibility,

137
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,870
spelled luminescent,
spell,

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,890
and then quickly descends into utter 
nonsense to headed tigers.

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,780
Three-Headed lion,
sulfur brimstone.

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,090
It doesn't matter if they said two 
headed tiger,

141
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,430
three-headed lions,
seven headed ethical Logan,

142
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,264
Paul,
or Frankfurt school jamming crusted 

143
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,154
Beagle Monster.
The joke will work on the audience no 

144
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:48,320
matter what they say,
because the show functions at a level of

145
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,860
selling you an empty joke under the 
guise of a meaningful one.

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,993
So here's the big question,
is that if the Big Bang theory's use of 

147
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,500
reference for reference's sake,
ultimately points at nothing,

148
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,393
then what are we laughing at?
My hair is growing at the rate of four 

149
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,870
point six meters per femtosecond.
Yeah.

150
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,713
Yeah.

151
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,710
Or at least what is the studio audience?
Laughing gas.

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,070
It is scientifically impossible for a 
person to typical.

153
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,723
Seriously.
Somebody please tell me her new sounded 

154
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:18,484
important,
but what you're forgetting is it was an 

155
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:24,140
achievement in the field of biology 
that's all about Yucky squishy thing.

156
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,930
Well,
after conducting a rigorous study,

157
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:33,240
our team of media experts has come up 
with an answer.

158
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,460
The show basically just it's on its 
characters.

159
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,420
That's all that's happening.

160
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,253
Princeton fine institution.
They'll place where Albert Einstein 

161
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:46,530
taught and where Leonard got his phd,
so it may have gone downhill

162
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,140
like

163
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,720
when Leonard and Raj think about buying 
Howard a prostitute,

164
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:55,150
following your recent breakup.
She's exactly a stipe a WHO,

165
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,950
if we hired her,
that would cheer him up.

166
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,290
We're not going to get Wolowitz a 
hooker.

167
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,013
I'm so lonely and Horny.
I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and 

168
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:13,934
ended.
Okay.

169
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,580
Or like when sheldon defenses girlfriend
Stewart's kind of interested in amy.

170
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,860
Oh,
of course she is.

171
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,320
She's very interesting.
Did you know when she was 14?

172
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,590
She suffered the webbing between her own
toes.

173
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,643
As it turns out,
ripping on people is actually how the 

174
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,164
philosophy of humor started in the West.
The earliest theory of humor is the 

175
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:42,580
superiority theory which began with 
plato saying that laughter was a form of

176
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:46,480
scorn that people we laugh at are 
generally unaware of how awful they are,

177
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,760
which invites our laughter.
Later on,

178
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:49,594
Thomas Hobbes modified this a little bit
by saying that laughter was a result of 

179
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,490
our competitive nature.
When we laugh,

180
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,270
it's either because we're triumphing 
over another or watching their downfall.

181
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,380
Hell,
even take heart,

182
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,250
waded into the discussion calling 
laughter.

183
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,620
The result of scorn which proceeds from 
are perceiving a small eval and a person

184
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,380
whom we consider to be deserving of it.
In the end,

185
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,660
all three philosophers agree that when 
we laugh,

186
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,270
it's at the expense of others to make 
ourselves feel good.

187
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,170
While this might seem pretty obvious,
the Big Bang theory isn't Seinfeld.

188
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,960
These aren't horrible people deserving 
our scorn.

189
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,460
Case in point,
show runner,

190
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:27,000
chuck lorre literally said,
the show is not about cakes or nerds,

191
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,140
but about extraordinary people,
so if they're so extraordinary,

192
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:31,974
why do they deserve to be done?
Which brings us to the big picture 

193
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,320
problem.
Instead of building up nerd culture,

194
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,213
the big bang theory kind of tears it 
down when the show simply pays lip 

195
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,610
service to nerdom mechanically inserting
any reference.

196
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,444
For reference's sake,
the show reveals its contempt for real 

197
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,044
nerds.
The details of nerd culture are 

198
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,540
irrelevant as long as they sound like 
winky assholes.

199
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,383
It's close enough.
I'm attempting to view my work as a 

200
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:01,170
fleeting peripheral image to engage the 
superior Colliculus of my brain,

201
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,400
and while the show can fall back on it's
laugh,

202
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,243
track or rip its characters long.
Has he been stuck actually about 30 

203
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:13,190
hours emotionally,
about 29 years.

204
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,490
Ultimately,

205
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,130
this does all of us nerds from the buffy
fan.

206
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:18,964
So the marvel fans a disservice instead 
of finding ourselves reflected on 

207
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:23,404
screen,
we see characters that kind of just get 

208
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,430
dumped on.
So what do you think?

209
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:30,730
Wise crack or we being too harsh on the 
biggest show in the world,

210
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,100
or are we being a bunch of jealous 
haters,

211
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,280
man,
not that one.

212
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,353
And Hey,
we could have avoided this mess had the 

213
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,010
big bang writers know about skillshare,
