1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,500
Pick somebody in your life and you send 
them a message asking them how their day

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:13,501
is going on a scale of one to 10 and 
it's very important that you ask them on

3
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:17,740
a scale of one to 10 for a couple of 
reasons,

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,730
you'll actually get more interesting 
answer because usually,

5
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,860
you know if somebody says a three or an 
eight,

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,330
they'll explain it a little bit and 
suddenly you're getting a little more in

7
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,164
depth information than you would 
normally get if you had just asked them 

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,480
how,
how are you doing?

9
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:32,380
Oh,
I'm fine,

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,400
or I'm tired or I'm hungry.
And then when you do get a reply,

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,670
what you do is you immediately texts 
back or write back and say,

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,360
is there anything I can do to make that 
number plus one?

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,283
Anything I could do to move you from a 
three to a four or from an eight to a 

14
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:50,984
nine.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,143
And that shows that you are really 
willing to take some time and effort to 

16
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,050
do,
you know,

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,240
little favorites.
It's a little boost for your friend.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,433
We know in looking at video games,
so this is one of the reasons why video 

19
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:09,790
games are such effective relationship 
management tools,

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,320
specifically social games like Farmville
or candy crush saga.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,910
Lots of research has shown that when you
play these games regularly with people,

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,830
you become more likely to talk to them 
about non game topics.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,753
You do that more frequently and you're 
also more likely to ask them for help 

24
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:32,320
with a real life problem or more willing
to offer them help and the reason why is

25
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:33,154
the design of the Games supports more 
frequent interactions which are really 

26
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,204
important for building up that kind of 
relationship and also to show 

27
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:40,924
reciprocity where you are asking someone
for help or you are offering help and 

28
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:47,434
you think about a game like farmville 
where you can go water some of these 

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,360
crops or feed their chickens for them.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,193
Or Candy Crush Saga where I'm constantly
asking my inlaws to send me extra lives 

31
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,800
and I'm sending them little power booths
in the game.

32
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,250
That little act of reciprocity,
I'm willing to help you.

33
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:05,680
You're willing to help me and doing it 
regularly.

34
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,514
You know,
everyday or a couple times a week that 

35
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,244
firmly cements in somebody's mind the 
idea of you as an ally and you might 

36
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,540
have people that you want to have 
thinking of you that way,

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,730
that aren't playing any of these video 
games.

38
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,564
So the plus one technique is a way to 
make sure that you're talking regularly 

39
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:25,954
about these everyday topics,
but also that you have a chance to give 

40
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:31,120
a little bit of support or help just,
you know,

41
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:33,340
what,
how can I move you just plus one on this

42
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,174
scale,
something small that I can do today and 

43
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,060
it's something that I do quite often 
that not only does it help,

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,070
you know,
make someone else's Day,

45
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:42,904
but I kind of enjoyed it when I get the 
chance to hear how people are doing and 

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,910
just do that one little thing to make 
their day better.

47
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,970
Parents love it.
Parents will love it.

48
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:57,990
When you do that,
that's like,

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,600
that's like the most prime audience for 
this.

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,070
They will write you back a paragraph on 
why it's an eight day and then,

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,710
and then you offered you plus one and 
their dislike.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,010
It's already plentiful on because you 
wrote.
