1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
What's up guys?
Paddling season continues out wise 

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,534
crack.
So last month we piled it a show called 

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,900
the film tourist.
It was on the wolf of Wall Street.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,150
If you haven't seen that one yet,
be sure to check it out.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,130
This is the second episode in that 
series.

6
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,200
This one is on the shining.
Before we get to it,

7
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,034
this video is sponsored by movie,

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,723
Kubrick's,
the shining or the world's most 

11
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,420
persuasive argument for taking the 
stairs.

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,120
This movie scares the shit out of 
everyone,

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,160
but why all this for you there

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,460
it's hard to say.
What exactly is wrong with this place is

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,860
haunted.
Is it all in their heads?

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,130
Is it possessed by the Devil Tony?
Something about an Indian burial ground.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,260
They located on an Indian burial ground.
Where else?

18
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,094
A lot of traditional horror gives us an 
easy to understand reason to shirt dark 

19
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,224
pants.
The shining deliberately avoids an 

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,723
easily describable premise and this is 
part of what makes it so damn 

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,660
horrifying.
It deprives us of logical explanation.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,720
Koop rick accomplishes this in a variety
of ways,

23
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:18,554
but I'm here at the overlook hotel to 
talk about one of the most surprisingly 

24
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:26,630
simple perspective.
One of the most effective ways to create

25
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:27,464
a stronger sense of perspective is 
through the way it's shot is framed and 

26
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,670
sequenced.
See,

27
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:34,160
a shot can be objective,
subjective,

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,510
or fall somewhere in between.
Purely objective shots.

29
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:43,511
Show us a scene as it is a God's eye 
point of view as a poor eavesdropping or

30
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,474
watching a play.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,733
Subjective ankles directly insert us 
into the action showing the view from 

32
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,370
just beside or behind a character.
Purely subjective shots take us directly

33
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:55,844
into the eyes of a character.
Usually by showing their face first 

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,653
followed by their visual perspective or 
emotional experience can also invite us 

35
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:07,550
to question what we're seeing like an 
unreliable narrator in literature.

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,350
In this scene we see a shot up Danny's 
face that a cut to the girls.

37
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,150
Then Danny's face again with this simple
sequence of shots were being shown.

38
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:21,380
The events through Danny's mind.
Let's see how cooper it takes this basic

39
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:25,490
principle perspective to create an 
indescribable supernatural feeling.

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,953
Consider the famous scene of Danny 
riding his tricycle through the hotel's 

41
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,580
winding corridors and you give me some 
skin.

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,353
All right.
Using a state of the art piece of 

43
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:38,804
equipment for the time who brick is able
to achieve supernaturally smooth 

44
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:42,644
movements.
To follow Danny showing us the hotel 

45
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,194
from a child's point of view.
We followed danny any traditional 

46
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:48,914
subjective shot that emphasizes his 
experience navigating a large maze like 

47
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,910
hotel,
but we don't follow him perfectly.

48
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,253
Watch how the camera lingers after he's 
left frame and then hurries to catch up 

49
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,224
with him.
One film scholar calls this the 

50
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,564
wandering camera because the camera 
ambles along like it's own sentient 

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,400
being or here and imagined monster 
stocking danny through the halls.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,880
This grates the sense the hotel is alive
and watching Danny through his vacation.

53
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,503
When the twins show up,
we move more intimately into a 

54
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,010
subjective sequence of Danny's pov 
flashing between his bloody visions.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,620
Danny covers his eyes,
looks again,

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,683
and now they're gone.
So perhaps the girls are just in his 

57
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,080
head by starting with Danny's point of 
view as we follow him,

58
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,093
but then shifting to a possible camera 
monsters point of view and then back to 

59
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,594
Danny's may be unreliable own vision.
The film undermines our ability to 

60
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:51,010
interpret the events in front of us 
whose point of view is this,

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,900
Dan?
He's the hotel,

62
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,853
some demon that,
let's consider Jack is all this creepy 

63
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,134
stuff in his head too.
Did someone just spike the water with 

64
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,154
Lsd in this otherwise normal hotel?
Take this scene in the apparently empty 

65
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:10,780
gold ballroom.
In this scene,

66
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,710
we go from a closeup of Jack as a 
seemingly addresses an invisible being,

67
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,743
the reveal shot of Lloyd.
This subjective sequencing of shots 

68
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,494
could suggest that Jack is hallucinating
and just when we're sure that this is 

69
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:24,964
all a subjective delusion,
kubrick moves the camera backward over 

70
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,210
his shoulder,
taking the shot from his direct point of

71
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,340
view to a more objective one.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,953
From there,
Kubrick gives the scene and objective 

73
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,340
reality by showing both characters in a 
shot together,

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,533
Lloyd's the real deal.
We think until Wendy shows up and the 

75
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:47,670
ballrooms suddenly empty and we're left 
totally confused and creeped hours,

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,600
so what's going on?
We don't know.

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,810
And the camera work makes sure we'll 
never find out.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,153
Now at times Jack's point of view even 
seems to merge with that of the imagine 

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,870
Predator that was following Danny in 
this shot.

80
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,600
Jack's view looking down on the model 
hedge maze,

81
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,830
Glen's into an aerial view of his family
wandering through the actual hedges.

82
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,580
This effect happens again as he chases 
Danny in the final scene.

83
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,863
See how the same kind of shot that used 
to be stuffing Danny through the halls 

84
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,550
has now mingled with Jack's point of 
view.

85
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,300
Further confounding the various 
supernatural elements of the film.

86
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,170
We're not using point of view to screw 
with reality.

87
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,610
Kubrick also uses our perception of 
physical space to creep us out.

88
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,493
How do you make a huge otherwise normal 
hotel and presented as a claustrophobic 

89
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:43,150
nightmare?
Kubrick is famous for what is called one

90
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,930
point perspective,
which adds to the cramped field with one

91
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,764
point perspective.
Near perfect symmetry draws the 

92
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:53,440
audience's eye to the one vanishing 
point at the center of the frame,

93
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,680
giving this sensation that we're being 
drawn into the shot,

94
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,420
which is further enhanced by the 
tracking shot inward.

95
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,380
It feels uneasy like the walls are 
collapsing inwards.

96
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,310
That's why even though the overlook 
hotel seems like a spacious setting,

97
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,550
we feel increasingly cramped as the 
movie goes on,

98
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,580
almost like claustrophobic rear,
which can occur when people are shunning

99
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,423
together over long periods of time by 
juxtaposing large spaces with much 

100
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,164
smaller ones,
Kubrick is able to get the viewer to 

101
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,170
feel really claustrophobic.
This starts with the opening shot of the

102
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,004
mountain,
which cuts to the shot of the family 

103
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,553
clown car style.
Then we moved from the large sweeping 

104
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:36,080
hotel lobby to the Torrance is small 
hotel corridors.

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,273
While the hotel may be large,
the torrance is are trapped and 

106
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,080
increasingly smaller spaces within it.

107
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,790
Eventually Jack ends up locked in a 
fridge.

108
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,340
Danny escapes through a tiny window and 
nobody has any elbow room.

109
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,743
Through these tricks and perspective.
Stanley Kubrick is able to add a layer 

110
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,780
of creepiness that if aid simple 
description,

111
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,990
and that's why the shining is so great 
and why film nerds will continue to talk

112
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,524
about it for years to come.
There's so much more to talk about in 

113
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,390
the shining.
So if you liked this video,

114
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,890
let us know if you want us to do 
another.

115
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,680
And as always,
thanks for watching peace.

116
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,370
All right guys,
hope you enjoy that.

117
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,620
We've got a couple more coming out 
before the end of the year.

118
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,390
So this episode is brought to you by

you know that movie has been gracious 
enough to support us there as well.

121
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,473
And because of them we're able to 
continue making episodes of the film 

122
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,570
tourists.

123
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,050
So movie is a curated online cinema that
focuses on procedures,

124

films,
festival hits and beloved classics.

125
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,750
There are always 30 perfectly curated 
movies on the site.

126
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,290
Every day they present a new film and 
every day they take one away.

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,220
Movies are really great way to discover 
international directors you might not be

128
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,054
exposed to otherwise.
Recently movie has been featuring the 

129
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,240
works of Hong Kong filmmaker Johnny Tow,
who was famous for making really awesome

130
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,074
gangster films.
I watched the film triad election in 

131
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,120
college and it catapulted my love for 
Hong Kong cinema.

132
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,463
That movie is playing now on movie along
with other johnny tow films like mad 

133
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:08,840
detective and vengeance.
So if you like gangster movies,

134
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,810
you're going to love Johnny Toe.
