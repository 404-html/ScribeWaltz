Hey guys,

2
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,630
Helen here.
Full disclosure,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,090
Oculus came to us and said they were 
fans of our work,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,983
which was one really flattering and two 
really awesome because you know jared 

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,980
and I love that new tech.
Anyway,

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:20,814
they asked if we had anything smart to 
say about Vr and Vr has been in the 

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,430
media a ton lately from the rise of 
[inaudible] and Nma,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,470
like sword art online and overlord,
who smash hits like ready player one.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,573
We got pretty excited.
Even rick and morty uses vr for one of 

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,570
our favorite gags.
Roy,

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,640
you're not bad.
Morty.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,920
Kind of wasted your thirties though with
that whole birdwatching faith.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,010
Where's my wife?
You were just playing a game.

14
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,450
It's called Roy snap out of it.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,310
Now I know we hear it.
Wise crack can get pretty tech,

16
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,144
the phobic,
but we wanted to try out this thing 

17
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:56,280
called optimism.
If science fiction is any indication the

18
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,530
mass exodus to virtual worlds is 
inevitable,

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,750
but instead of jumping on the prophecy 
train,

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,733
we're going to talk about some of the 
philosophical ramifications of the art 

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,680
technology and how it can revolutionize 
storytelling and perspective,

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,850
and while we could view Vr as just 
another step in technology like the jump

23
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,670
from radio to film,
there seems to be something more to it.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,653
That's something we think is a 
philosophical concept called Kuala 

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,680
welcome to this wise crack addition on 
the philosophy of Vr and yeah.

26
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,030
Wow.
No spoilers ahead,

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,493
but before we get into quality out,
we should say something about 

28
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,104
storytelling.
There are a million reasons why someone 

29
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:30,924
would tell a story the muses told you to
or the absence told you to or the 

30
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,054
amphetamines told you to,
but at the core of every story is a 

31
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,060
single ask to inhabit a character's 
perspective.

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,910
Roald Dahl,
author of everyone's favorite book about

33
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,900
a greedy CEO exploiting immigrant labor,
said it best in Matilda.

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,823
The books transported Matilda into new 
worlds and introduced her to amazing 

35
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:55,900
people who live exciting lives.
She went on olden days,

36
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:59,580
sailing ships with Joseph Conrad.
She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway

37
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,414
and to India with Rudy kipling.
She traveled all over the world while 

38
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:03,654
sitting in her little room in an English
village by allowing us to inhabit the 

39
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,434
mind and body of its characters.
Storytelling can challenge our 

40
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,374
perspective and change our views,
but as amazing as these stories are 

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,690
traditional mediums like literature and 
film,

42
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:19,020
stop a little short when it comes to 
inhabiting the perspective,

43
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,210
whether we're living vicariously through
Frodo,

44
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,044
delivering the ring to more door or the 
dude just trying to get his rug back on 

45
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:26,524
your feet and lift.
We're always reminded of the space 

46
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,050
between us and the characters.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,550
John Gardner,
in his book,

48
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,384
the art of fiction calls this concept 
psychic distance or basically how deep 

49
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,034
we are in the character's head.
It's the difference between reading the 

50
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:40,884
sentence.
He walked to the store and he ambled to 

51
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:46,020
the store.
Wild thoughts racing on his mind.

52
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,700
The latter example brings us closer,
but regardless of how the story is told,

53
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,773
we can never collapsed the psychic 
distance to zero while staring at the 

54
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,224
pages.
In a book or a TV on the wall will 

55
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,250
inevitably notice that these thoughts 
and aren't our own,

56
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,173
and as it turns out,
there's a good philosophical reason why 

57
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:08,401
this distance can never be fully closed.
This concept called Kuala in philosophy.

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,070
Quality is the idea that mental states 
like perception,

59
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,270
sensations,
thoughts,

60
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:16,900
and emotions all have a certain 
subjective feeling to them.

61
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,210
When you sip wine or stare at the 
sunset,

62
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,540
these experiences are all unique to you 
in that moment.

63
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,500
The key word here is unique.
Your friend could do all the same things

64
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,334
and still have a different experience 
and you wouldn't ever be able to really 

65
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,180
explain this difference either.
As philosopher Thomas Nagel explained in

66
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,010
his paper,
what is it like to be a bat?

67
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,500
We could know everything there is to 
know about that,

68
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,363
but that doesn't translate to knowing 
what it's like to be flapping about and 

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,543
navigating via sound.
And that's the weird thing about this 

70
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,034
whole quality of debate.
There's an explanatory gap between 

71
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,184
knowledge and experience.
One that has some pretty big 

72
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,034
philosophical and everyday consequences 
for philosophers who believed that the 

73
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,290
world can be explained by laws and 
science.

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,333
They now have to explain this new type 
of knowledge seemingly unrelated to 

75
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:04,210
facts and for everyone else,
we're doomed to tell funny stories about

76
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,920
things that happened,
failed,

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,690
and then fall back on the old.

78
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,613
You should have been their defense.
The big takeaway is that this gap 

79
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:15,370
between knowledge and experience is real
and no matter how many words we write on

80
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,310
a page or how many flashing images we 
have on the screen,

81
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,180
we can never bridge that well,
maybe not never.

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,850
So what does that have to do with Vr?
Well,

83
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:29,851
the reason why Vr is so groundbreaking,
or in Marty's case mind bending morty,

84
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,363
you're rick,
is because vr gets us infinitely closer 

85
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,150
to bridging that gap.
Unlike reading a book or watching TV,

86
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,223
Vr is an embodied experience.
You're right there in the story 

87
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,420
sometimes inhabiting the body of your 
favorite characters.

88
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,840
This not only drastically reduces the 
psychic distance gardener talked about,

89
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,360
but it also deals with the pesky quality
of problem.

90
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,450
Can't adequately explain how great your 
vacation was to your friends.

91
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,373
Well,
let them experience it themselves by 

92
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:57,670
throwing a headset on them and we can't 
emphasize this enough.

93
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,720
The difference between knowing something
and experiencing something is huge.

94
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,960
It's why you can feel somewhat safe 
watching the ring on tv,

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,273
but grab your pants,
the threesixty experience combined vr 

96
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:09,784
with haptic feedback and full body 
motion tracking and you can easily be 

97
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,920
fully immersed for hours.
Now,

98
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,990
before we move on,
as I mentioned,

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,853
this video is sponsored by Oculus rift.
If you're looking to dive into new 

100
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,540
worlds,
it's available for only three 99.

101
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,140
If you've ever wanted to be a rage 
filled green giant or a sas field,

102
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,974
trash panda,
you can save the world and marvel 

103
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,650
powers,
United Vr,

104
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,190
or if you've ever wanted to get your 
tabletop strategy game on and don't have

105
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,350
hundreds of hours to build Internet 
landscapes.

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,870
There's brass tactics which looks so 
cool.

107
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,340
There's also the story driven Lone Echo 
and the robotic mayhem of echo arena and

108
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,520
there are all exclusive.
If you want to see me try out the oculus

109
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,830
rift for myself,
stick around till the end of the video.

110
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,600
Now,
back to the philosophy.

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,430
Okay,
I know what you're thinking,

112
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,383
Helen.
Even a vr allows you to sit behind the 

113
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:54,934
eyes of your favorite characters.
That experience is still subjective and 

114
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,454
unique to you.
Multiple friends could watch the same 

115
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,124
three 60 film or play the same vr game 
and they would still all have different 

116
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,934
experiences.
We haven't fully bridged quality as 

117
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,760
explanatory gap and while that's 
definitely true,

118
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,150
vr actively tries to combat this.
At comic con,

119
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,360
we caught up with Ian Forester,
CEO of Vr playhouse,

120
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,150
who's team had just created a vr 
experience for the show.

121
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,970
Mr Mercedes,
when asked about the explanatory gap,

122
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,893
he told us how good vr tries to bridge 
it and trying to create a fully 

123
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:27,794
immersive experience.
There needs to be a palate cleanser 

124
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,420
almost.
It's what we refer to as onboarding.

125
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,400
You are you.
We get that,

126
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,234
but now you're going to assume a 
different role and different 

127
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:37,904
circumstance.

128
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,300
Onboarding is essentially a tutorial 
section in a vr experience.

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,193
It tells you about the character you're 
inhabiting and how to interact with the 

130
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,520
vr world around you.
In doing so,

131
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,350
onboarding combats the explanatory gap 
by asking you to forget well yourself.

132
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,530
It's kind of like the suspension of 
disbelief in theater,

133
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,260
except instead of asking us to forget 
the stage,

134
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,510
the curtains,
the not very convincing set,

135
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,660
it's asking us to forget our actual 
selves,

136
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,553
so how effectively can vr bridge quality
as explanatory gap stripping us of us 

137
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,900
and making us assume a new identity?
The short answer is pretty damn well.

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,930
Recent studies have shown some science 
fiction level results.

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,793
For example,
in one study when white subjects 

140
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,104
inhabited a black virtual Avatar,
they actually exhibit noticeably less 

141
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,214
racial bias than those who didn't.
In another experiment when adults were 

142
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,634
placed in a virtual child's body,
they started exhibiting more childlike 

143
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,143
behaviors.

144
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,250
According to philosopher Frederick David
Moan,

145
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,670
our sense of self is deeply entangled 
with the body we inhabit,

146
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,863
partly because our body is the only 
thing we both perceived and perceive 

147
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,000
width.
It's a bit like acting.

148
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,330
We notice our costume and we start 
adjusting our attitudes accordingly,

149
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,403
and while we might not fully be able to 
know 100 percent was like to be another 

150
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,600
person,
vr can get as close.

151
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,583
It's exactly vrs ability to almost 
inhabit other subjective experiences 

152
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,590
that makes it right for new therapy 
techniques.

153
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,191
Freud,
me,

154
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,024
for example,
puts patients in a motion capture suit 

155
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,410
and a Vr headset.
When the program starts,

156
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,590
patients find themselves in a vr replica
of their own body moving exactly in sync

157
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:09,524
with their real life body.
They then tell a silent Dr Freud across 

158
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:14,540
the room about their problems.
After they're done,

159
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,553
users then inhabit the body of Dr Freud 
and hear their own problems from this 

160
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,630
outside perspective before offering 
solutions to themselves.

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,950
The results are pretty crazy with 
patients reportedly experiencing greatly

162
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,380
improved moves after undergoing the art 
therapy,

163
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,160
all because patients were able to step 
outside of their own bodies,

164
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,563
and it's not just virtual chitchats with
Freud that are seeing great results in 

165
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:38,954
Vr therapy.
Things like exposure therapy or helping 

166
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:45,530
patients conquer certain fears and 
phobias by facing them have huge success

167
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,240
rates in Vr.
In one study,

168
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,223
vr exposure therapy had over a 90 
percent success rate in treating the 

169
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:54,290
fear of flying,
which seems better than the popular pop,

170
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,460
a Xanax and downed a bottle of wine 
approach,

171
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,010
but buckling patients into a new 
perspective,

172
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,560
it gives them a safer way to face their 
fears.

173
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,573
Well,
some might consider vr a form of escape 

174
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:04,854
from reality.
We can also see how it can give us an 

175
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,320
entirely new perspective on the very not
fictional world.

176
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,420
So what does the future of Vr hold?

177
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,343
Well,
we may be a long way off from a full 

178
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,354
ready player one,
but with computers getting stronger and 

179
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,830
wireless headsets coming out,
we're making progress.

180
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,813
And while we as a society sometimes 
indulgent fearmongering about future 

181
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:24,774
tech from skynet Matrix,
vr has the potential to make a really 

182
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,320
positive impact.
Did you know there are guys who actually

183
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,154
lug heavy threesixty cameras around 
mountain trails and just so people who 

184
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:37,980
can't hike them can still experience 
them and yeah,

185
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,770
we might be scared of creating some 
ready player.

186
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:43,440
One escape is nightmare,
but a social philosopher,

187
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,274
Ernst Bloch argued daydreaming and 
escapism actually can positively 

188
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,934
influence society by exploring the 
possibilities of how things could be 

189
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,444
different.
We engaged in an immature but honest 

190
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,204
substitute for revolution,
one that can bring about machine to 

191
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,300
change the society today,
right?

192
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,170
I want to check out this oculus rift and
see what it's all about.

193
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,620
I also just want to say that without 
sponsors like oculus rift,

194
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,690
many of our episodes wouldn't even be 
possible,

195
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,690
so thanks guys.
Now where's my headset out?

196
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,963
Let's do this.

197
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Here we go.
Alright,

198
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,293
here we go.

199
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,940
Robo recall

200
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,600
hook your regularly scheduled 
programming incoming.

201
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,083
That was awesome.
