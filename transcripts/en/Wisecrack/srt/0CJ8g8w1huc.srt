1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,340
About a decade ago I realized that if we
were going to go to Mars with people,

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:07,710
it'd be really expensive.
And so I thought to myself,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,743
what activities have human cultures 
engaged in in the past that were as 

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:15,834
expensive as what it might be to go to 
Mars and what motivated them to spend 

5
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,210
that money?
I was going to fill a whole book,

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,710
motivations to do great things,
great expensive things,

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,890
and then I find the uh,
the task,

8
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:36,600
I'd find the activity that more most 
closely resembled what it would be to go

9
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,360
to Mars in the 21st century.
I said,

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,130
oh,
is that what that culture did with their

11
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,690
population?
Is that how they raised the money?

12
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,524
And that's how they convinced the people
I was going to fill a whole book of 

13
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,850
this.
It'd be a nice little reference catalog,

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,650
but how to get something done in modern 
times in conducting that exercise,

15
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,170
what I found is that there only three 
drivers,

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,270
not more,
not less,

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,170
three drivers that account for the most 
expensive,

18
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,240
ambitious projects humans have ever 
undertaken.

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,230
One of them is the praise of deity or 
royalty.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,550
That's what got you.
Got You.

21
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:11,580
The pyramids.
They're basically expensive tombstones,

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,850
so it got the cathedral and Church 
building of Europe.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,953
That was a period where huge fractions 
of of societal investment went into 

24
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:24,420
those activities.
There's less of that today,

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,373
so that's not really a useful driver to 
think about how we might transform the 

26
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,920
21st century.
Another driver is war.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,300
Nobody wants to die.
That gets you the Great Wall of China.

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,613
That gets you the Manhattan project 
where we built the bond that gets you 

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,150
the Apollo project.

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,100
Okay.

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,770
Another driver,
this search for economic return,

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,870
nobody wants to die.
Nobody wants to die.

33
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,120
Poor.
The search for economic return.

34
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:56,380
That's what is responsible for the 
Columbus oranges,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,580
the Magellan voyage,
Lewis and Clark,

36
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,763
figuring out what is beyond that 
frontier in hugely expensive enterprise 

37
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,444
is conducted by government.
So if we're going to go to Mars and if 

38
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:16,060
war is not the driver did you could,
it could easily become the driver.

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,463
If,
if we'd be getting another space race 

40
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,190
with someone,
we view as a military adversary,

41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,980
wonder who that might be.

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,270
Okay.

43
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,103
But if peaceful heads prevail,
then war is not the driver available to 

44
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,490
you.
Let's check our list.

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,473
Well,
kings and gods are not sufficient in 

46
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,100
modern times to undergo heavy projects 
such as that.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,860
What's left the promise of economic 
return.

48
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,810
You can go into space,
transform society changed the Zeitgeists

49
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:45,644
of your culture.
Turn everyone into people who embrace 

50
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,430
and value science,
technology,

51
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,390
engineering,
and math,

52
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,343
the stem fields,
whether or not people go into space or 

53
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,024
serve the space industry,
they will have the sensitivity to those 

54
00:02:58,701 --> 00:02:59,534
fields to stimulate unending innovation 
in the technology and the technological 

55
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,564
fields.
And is that innovation in the 21st 

56
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,080
century that will drive tomorrow's 
economies?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,250
Any frontier in space now involves 
biologists were looking for life.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,560
Chemist,
geologists,

59
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,930
physicists,
mechanical engineering,

60
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,930
electrical engineers,
uh,

61
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,520
uh,
aerospace engineer's astrophysicist.

62
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,354
All the traditional sciences and 
engineering frontiers are captured in 

63
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,504
any ambitious goal to explore space.
We can recapture those times and 

64
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:38,854
reinvent America.
We've already invented American once 

65
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,780
before.
It's ripe.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,130
It's ready,
and it's willing,

67
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,980
I think,
to be invented again.
