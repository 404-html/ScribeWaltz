two weeks.
Stick around for some Tacos.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,141
Hey,
why is it cracked?

5
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:13,974
Jared again,
for a franchise so surrounded than 

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,630
mystery,
it seems fitting that nobody had a clue.

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,880
The cloverfield paradox had even been 
made,

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,773
let alone that it was being released 
within hours of its announcement during 

9
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,924
the super bowl.
Now there are plenty of reasons why the 

10
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:30,330
cloverfield paradox should have worked 
and plenty of reasons why it didn't,

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,523
but we're going to focus on the element 
that makes to largely unrelated scripts 

12
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,244
so unique and cohesive and makes the 
third one such an epic fail that 

13
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:42,030
element,
our relationship to reality and trauma.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,450
Welcome this wise crack addition on the 
cloverfield paradox,

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,313
what went wrong and spoilers ahead for 
all of the cloverfield movies before we 

16
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,604
dip into that secret sauce,
a recap of the cloverfield paradoxes in 

17
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:55,590
order.
The year is 20 slash 28 and the world is

18
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,424
in the midst of an energy crisis.
Be Crew aboard cloverfield station are 

19
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:03,330
orbiting Earth to test the experimental 
shepherd particle accelerator,

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,630
which they hope will save the world by 
producing safe,

21
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,060
clean energy just before they turn on 
the machine.

22
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,894
Though we overhear an interview with a 
writer who thinks that turning on the 

23
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,224
particle accelerator will open a 
wormhole to other dimensions and 

24
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,160
release.
God knows what,

25
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,900
onto an unsuspecting population

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,610
the likes of which we have never seen

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,200
and surprise.
This is exactly what happens there,

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,073
teleported into another dimension across
space where they experienced the 

29
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:34,770
combined horrors of Phantom limbs,
creepy crawlers,

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,220
and faulty wiring.
The crew must figure out how to get home

31
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,054
and well,
you can probably figure out where it 

32
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:40,644
goes from there.
If there's one thing we should be 

33
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,400
excited about getting into the 
cloverfield paradox,

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,323
it's answers.
What was the giant monster that attack 

35
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,300
New York at the end of the first one?
Did it survive the nuke?

36
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,070
If we hope to get those answers in 10 
cloverfield lane,

37
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,963
well we're out of luck.
Instead we get Walter Sobchak reminding 

38
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,620
us that this isn't nom.
There are rules.

39
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,380
Yeah,
that's great.

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,970
Sorry,
I just got a little excited.

41
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,350
Well,
keeping that point

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,320
and as our protagonist escapes his 
clutches,

43
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,180
she enters a world of pain and aliens 
come on,

44
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,530
but the cloverfield paradox does give us
answers those giant monsters.

45
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,140
It's from another dimension,
the camcorder video.

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,660
It might not even be from the same 
timeline,

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,900
so why isn't getting these answers more 
rewarding.

48
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,800
Cloverfield and 10 cloverfield lane are 
both films about trauma,

49
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,823
both the trauma one might associate with
war or natural disaster or extra 

50
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:33,684
dimensional aliens destroying your home 
and the trauma of being physically 

51
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,360
trapped in a relationship with a person 
that's going to go full Jack Torrance at

52
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,194
any minute,
ears johnny 10 cloverfield lane brings 

53
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,570
up all the same aspects of abusive 
relationships.

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,030
Possible gas lighting.
There is nowhere to go,

55
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:52,230
Michelle and threats of violence 
interspersed with normal family fund,

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,200
but the first two movies aren't just 
about dealing with trauma.

57
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,710
They are about the impossibility of 
fully comprehending that trauma.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,230
These insanely violent encounters with a
lack of closure.

59
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,300
Speak to one of the fundamental 
difficulties of navigating the world for

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,520
philosopher and sometimes Klepto Maniac 
Jacques Lacan.

61
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,443
There exists a fundamental human 
inability to fully grasp what he calls 

62
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,820
the real or the world as it truly is,
who were field throws us in the midst of

63
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,640
an alien invasion that evades easy 
description.

64
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,360
We're often given the byproduct of 
what's happening or people's reactions,

65
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,253
but almost never get the source of the 
turmoil and unexplainable way like when 

66
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,424
the head of the Statue of Liberty comes 
rolling down the street or a 

67
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,780
horrifically disfigured woman is begging
for help.

68
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,323
First cloverfield the reality of what's 
happening only sparsely comes in new 

69
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:42,474
segments in the background.
One of the ways cloverfield achieves 

70
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:45,554
this is with perspective.
It's filmed pov style shot by the 

71
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,394
characters in the movie and begins with 
a detailed look at our main cast of 

72
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:52,844
characters during a party for the 
protagonist rob in the middle of the 

73
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,384
Shin Dig.
They're interrupted by an explosion 

74
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,800
signaling the monster invasion,
their battle for survival.

75
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,680
Cinder cut with older video that is 
being recorded over,

76
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,980
which gives you glimpses into the 
relationship between rob and Beth.

77
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,023
This subjective point of view means we 
only ever get hints of where and what 

78
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:11,984
the monster is.
How the military are responding to it 

79
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,920
and even what it looks like,
you know,

80
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,710
just like you would in real life by 
shooting it this way.

81
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,080
We don't know what kind of monster they 
are facing,

82
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,890
but we do know who the characters are 
and what they're facing personally.

83
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,950
10 cloverfield lane employs a similar 
technique.

84
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,053
It doesn't use the same Pov south who 
cut us off from the reality of what's 

85
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,624
happening,
but rather uses a concrete bunker to 

86
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:35,444
similar ends.
The protagonist Michelle wakes up in a 

87
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,144
bunker that she can't leave for reasons 
that seemed suspicious to say the least 

88
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,880
she's told she was rescued.

89
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,490
Give it us how I saved your life.
I think that's acceptable

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,500
and that the outside world is deadly

91
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,910
outside of here.

92
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,423
Now,
if we suspect that Howard is preparing 

93
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,704
to where Michelle skin,
we get just enough interaction from the 

94
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,810
outside world to give credence to his 
story,

95
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,570
but not enough to truly know what's 
happening.

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,750
As the movie ends,
we get enough information to let us know

97
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,820
that things aren't going great for 
earth,

98
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:07,654
but not much else.
The control of information in both 

99
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,760
movies is what makes them so tense and 
entertaining.

100
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,180
We have to fill in the gap which instead
of being frustrating makes with the sort

101
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:21,460
of thing that spawns endless.
Fan theories for Lacan that reality,

102
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,294
which seems to evade us the real,
is disconnected from our own personal 

103
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,464
experience only through language or what
he calls the symbolic can we bridge the 

104
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,920
gap between our minds and the reality 
beyond them.

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,360
What cloverfield explorers is the chasm 
between the real and language,

106
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,930
the inability to bridge that gap,
the characters and us.

107
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,830
The audience want answers.
We want to understand what is happening,

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,530
but the film withholds the language to 
explain it.

109
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,813
That chasm for Lacan is called Lac and 
it's what drives the tension of the 

110
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,284
first two movies.
We all know what it's like to be at a 

111
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,270
loss for words during a terrible event.
Footage of nine slash 11 shows onlookers

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,193
covering their mouths in silent horror 
while watching the tragic events happen 

113
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,124
in front of them.
It's no secret that these cinema verite 

114
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,154
found footage style of the original 
cloverfield was inspired by the events 

115
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,054
and coverage of nine slash 11,
that kind of cultural trauma runs deep 

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,360
and was still a raw nerve at the time of
the trailers release.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,080
Mass entertainment wasn't willing to 
return to these sorts of disaster movies

118
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,914
right away,
but the movie is able to tap into that 

119
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,494
post nine slash 11 anxiety by borrowing 
from the structure of hygiene movies 

120
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,770
there by using a symbol to represent 
that shared trauma.

121
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,963
This is what makes it so cathartic.
10 cloverfield lane released some eight 

122
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,164
years later at a time of cultural 
uncertainty and change was a paranoid 

123
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:39,884
thriller that makes you question the 
people around you against this gap 

124
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:43,664
between language and reality.
The cloverfield paradox gives us its 

125
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,290
antithesis sites.

126
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,450
This is the paradox.
Excuse me,

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,560
particles interacting with each other 
across two dimensions.

128
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,623
Okay,
I'm going to sit down to have distinct 

129
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,590
realities in a multiverse.

130
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,990
While there are certainly unexplained 
events like why the hell did Mondays arm

131
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:02,824
keep moving after it was detached?
The whole premise of the movie trans 

132
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:10,060
dimensional travel explains the origin 
of the cloverfield event in the first 15

133
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:10,900
minutes of the movie

134
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,010
monsters,
Demons East to clarify,

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,233
you believe their efforts to solve the 
energy crisis might unleash demons and 

136
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:24,280
not just hearing that in the past,
in the future,

137
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,960
in other dimensions,

138
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,123
sure.
We're not saying mysteries can't be 

139
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,094
solved or that science can do it,
but it shouldn't be as background noise 

140
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,070
in the first half of the movie turns out
the terrifying,

141
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:35,904
ineffable monstrosities that have 
invaded earth for reasons beyond our 

142
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:42,630
imagining happened because sites little 
disappointing isn't it,

143
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,270
and if you're going to give an 
explanation or revelation,

144
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,050
there's a certain way to do it.
Good examples tend to give us a paradigm

145
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,840
shift or clarify motives.
In exceptional cases,

146
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:55,020
they can give you an entirely new way to
view the events prior,

147
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,350
like when you find out the truth about 
Tyler durden or the men in black.

148
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,363
How does quantum entanglement add to or 
reframe the original cloverfield 

149
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,870
stories?
It doesn't,

150
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,033
and besides breaking away from the kind 
of trauma that defined the first two 

151
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,454
movies,
there is no central fear or shared 

152
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,660
trauma for the audience to latch onto.

153
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,250
If cloverfield was the fear of an 
invasion and 10 cloverfield lane was the

154
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:20,520
fear of other people,
what's the central fear of this movie?

155
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,300
Fear of particle accelerators,
peak oil by explaining way,

156
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,134
the mystery almost as an afterthought.
You Rub the audience not just of their 

157
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:31,680
mystery but there catharsis.
While yes,

158
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:35,040
explaining a mystery ruins the fun is 
kind of an obvious point.

159
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,023
It's what creates our desires for 
mystery that is important to the 

160
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,850
cloverfield movies.
MILIKAN's idea of lack gets to the heart

161
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:42,684
of understanding why we love a good 
mystery and why jj Abrams property 

162
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,560
seemed to have such a hard time with 
resolving those mysteries.

163
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,573
We're looking at you last just to the 
reality around us always evades easy 

164
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,320
answers and the to describe it.
We don't want everything explained,

165
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,200
not just because we all like a good 
conspiracy theory,

166
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,123
but because of the catharsis that comes 
with these shared experience of 

167
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:09,300
realizing that some things can't end 
sometimes shouldn't be put into words.

168
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,660
The first to cloverfield movies knew 
this and played on that,

169
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,710
which is what made them so interesting 
and ultimately rewarding.

170
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,753
The cloverfield paradox paradoxically 
ruins the fun by giving us all the 

171
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:25,440
answers and pretty half baked ones at 
that.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,513
So what do you think wisecrack can the 
movie have more tastefully explain the 

173
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,264
mystery.
Let us know what you think in the 

174
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,310

and as always,

175
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,810
thanks for watching.

cloverfield may not have been the PSI 
Phi mind bender we'd hoped for,

177
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:42,350
but as I've found,
everything is made better with Tacos and

178
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,184

spicy black bean and caramelized onion

tacos from blue apron,
