1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,450
It's something of a cliche to say this,
but we live in a knowledge economy.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,733
Increasingly peoples,
a person's ability to command a high 

3
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:16,780
wage is going to depend upon having some
skills,

4
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:17,614
having skills that relate to perhaps 
technology doesn't always have to be 

5
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,534
technology,
but it has to be some kind of value add 

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,253
that you provide that allows you to 
command some pricing power in the labor 

7
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,180
market.
Uh,

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,130
how you do that is going to vary from 
industry to industry.

9
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:40,990
In some cases it'll be doing things that
computers do well as a data analyst.

10
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,720
For example.
In some cases it'll be doing things that

11
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:46,180
computers can't do,
a human touch,

12
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,580
professionals nursing and things like 
that,

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,683
but whatever it is,
you're going to have to focus very hard 

14
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:52,264
on those skills and the only way you can
get those skills through learning and 

15
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,634
through continuous learning and any 
company trying to hiring people will 

16
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,474
recognize that probably the trade 
they're looking for most is not a 

17
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,900
particular set of skills,
but the,

18
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,930
the demonstrated ability to acquire 
skills because any company will realize.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,620
I think that what's crucial is not the 
particular set of skills you have,

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,723
but that you demonstrate a capacity to 
acquire them now because a few years 

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,110
from now,
a few months from now,

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,270
it might turn out that you have to 
acquire new ones.

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,520
Look at software programmers,
for example,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,833
any software programmer knows that 
within two or three years for almost 

25
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:32,974
everything they're doing right now will 
be obsolete and they will have to learn 

26
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,394
a whole new language as it were,
depending on whether you're talking 

27
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,770
about mobile,
whether you're talking about apps,

28
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:42,604
whether you're talking about traditional
computers and of course depending on 

29
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,970
what the particular configuration of 
hardware and software you're using.

30
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,430
So all that keeps changing,
uh,

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,800
in many,
many worlds.

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,320
And I think that because of the 
information revolution,

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,393
it's going to happen even more so in 
worlds that we don't usually think of 

34
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:00,874
changing.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,480
Accreditation's in some way are the holy
grail of education.

36
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,853
The reason that American universities 
are able to charge the extraordinary 

37
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:17,504
price they charge a is because employers
around the world believe that this is 

38
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,204
the single best sorting mechanism.
They have to figure out whom to hire so 

39
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,334
that if you have a undergraduate degree 
from Harvard or war or University of 

40
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,580
Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
uh,

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,533
a bank is,
particularly if it's in majoring in 

42
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:43,130
economics,
a bank is going to think of the 20,000

43
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:46,520
applications we get for our entry 300 
positions.

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,893
These are some very good filters.
We look at the people who went to 

45
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,640
Harvard and wharton and Stanford and 
things like that.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,570
If you're looking for people who are 
software programmers,

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,653
uh,
if they have gone to a good computer 

48
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,594
science program at a good university,
you assume that's a very good way to 

49
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,184
start to filter down.
And then you probably go through 

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,150
interviews and things like that.

51
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,510
What if somebody came to a technology 
company or a bank and said,

52
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,344
look,
I don't have the degree that you're 

53
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,324
looking for,
but I did take 25 courses online from 

54
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:20,500
these five online,
a core of Moocs,

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,580
many of which are Stanford courses and 
Harvard courses and mit courses.

56
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,160
Uh,
and here's what I,

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,033
how I did.
And here is a piece of paper that have 

58
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,183
pieces of paper that prove,
that demonstrate that I finished those 

59
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,050
courses,
the grades I got on them,

60
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,790
etc.
If employers start treating those pieces

61
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,850
of paper,
those accreditation's as worth a lot.

62
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,040
That completely changes the nature of 
educatIon because then you are not,

63
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,923
you know,
what you are being paid for is really 

64
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:51,954
more outcome related.
It is related to what skills have you 

65
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,564
acquired rather than process-related did
you go to a four year bricks and mortar 

66
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,470
college and live in the dorms with other
people.

67
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,570
Some people may still value that ladder 
one.

68
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:05,404
And by the way,
it may still be worth worthwhile for 

69
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,900
some people to pay that because of the 
network effect because of the people you

70
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,830
meet at a harvard or yale.
But you could imagine that,

71
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,664
that,
that would not be true at universities 

72
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,720
one tear down or certainly two tiers 
down.

73
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,340
Uh,
and in any case,

74
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,443
it would place huge pressure on the 
pricing model because all of a sudden 

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,830
people are able to access many of the 
skills that,

76
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:31,664
uh,
that you're being taught in a top 

77
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,430
universities.
At a fraction of the price.

78
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,383
so the key here is whether the employers
begin to view accreditation as an 

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,140
outcome based process on skills as 
opposed to a,

80
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,190
um,
a,

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,133
you know,
a kind of a process in which it's very 

82
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,150
important that you have spent the four 
years at the college,

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,293
uh,
and,

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,140
and acquired the full rounded education 
that,

85
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:58,180
that college provides.
