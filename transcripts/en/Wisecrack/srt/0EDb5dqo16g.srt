1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,500
What the word flip flop flopper,
uh,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,353
denotes,
is the fact that people want to be 

3
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:11,160
elected so bad.
They want this power so bad that they'll

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:11,994
say anything to get it.
And all you gotta do is watch some of 

5
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,870
these politicians.
And my God,

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,531
it,
it is,

7
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:17,231
oh,
poops up.

8
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:21,180
They're just jumping right across the 
board and they're all doing it.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,430
They're all doing it on the democratic 
side.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,533
I think that there probably,
you'll see a little more consistency 

11
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,830
with Dennis percentage,
but he's got other problems.

12
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:30,120
He's,
he's liberal,

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,133
uh,
on politics as usual and the liberal 

14
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,100
side,
but he's the best of the bunch.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,050
And,
and so on the other side,

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,430
but you see them,
they change.

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,900
Now it's very important to realize that,
and I'll say this about,

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,130
uh,
Edwards,

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,510
you know,
Edwards voted for the war and I find him

20
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:52,380
extremely sincere about the fact of,
uh,

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,543
of w w the mistake he made.
And so I really take his sincerity 

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,620
straightaway.
That flip floppy,

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,640
no,
not for me.

24
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,474
Edwards was not flip fucking,
he was informed by experience and that 

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
we all are.
And that's the advantage I bring to the 

26
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,004
presidency.
I'm informed by experience and I've got 

27
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,110
a lot more experienced than all the 
others put together.
