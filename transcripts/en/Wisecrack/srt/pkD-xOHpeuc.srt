00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,893
Hey wisecrack jared here,
and we've got a special quick take to 

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,240
prime you guys for the release of blade 
runner 2049.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,403
As you might guess,
we're big fans of the original blade 

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,800
runner and are super excited to see how 
the sql not only continues the plot,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,663
but develops the themes that made the 
original so legendary to wet our 

6
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,804
appetite.
Even more crunchy roll has a first look 

7
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:27,780
on a 15 minute blade runner,
animate directed by cowboy bebop.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,610
Mega director Shin is Watson Nabi that 
bridges the original and the sequel,

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,743
and it's actually really good.
Not only does it carry on the same 

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,600
visual style and the Neos,
Anwar pitch black tone,

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,553
but it reflects on many of the same 
themes and symbols present in the 

12
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,214
original.
So big thanks to crunch roll role for 

13
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:49,830
giving us an exclusive sneak peek at the
short and making this video possible.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,113
Blade runner is a really dense,
profound film full of symbols that also 

15
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,704
make an appearance in blackout 2022.
So let's unpack how these symbols give 

16
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,234
us a better understanding of what it 
means to be human and perhaps derive a 

17
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,580
sense of what we can expect from blade 
runner.

18
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,480
Twenty,
49.

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,663
Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on 
blade runner and blackout 20 slash 22 

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,740
and heads up.
This discussion will spoil some key plot

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,470
points of the anime.
So if you want to watch it right now for

22
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,440
free,
had you crunchy roll.com/wise

23
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,274
crack.
So let's get to first a quick recap of 

24
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:27,681
blackout 2022 to replicants Trixie and 
ag go on a mission to destroy a database

25
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,260
that holds a registry of all replicants 
on earth.

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,303
One of the primary themes of the 
original is interrogating the line 

27
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:38,610
between human and Automaton,
both blade runner and blackout 20.

28
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,850
To explore this dynamic using three key 
symbols,

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,650
the eye,
the doll,

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,603
and the dove.
Number one on the original blade runner 

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,450
places,
significant emphasis on eyes.

32
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,050
The void contest examines eyes to detect
if someone is a replicant or not.

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,380
Roy and Leon meet the designer of their 
own eyes,

34
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,383
and Roy even kills his own maker by 
giving him an extreme bits of Iq 

35
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,610
puncture.
Similarly in blackout,

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,940
the characters right eyes are coated 
with a mark,

37
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,803
identifying them as replicants Bi is 
also relevant and how replicants and 

38
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:17,190
humans define themselves through images 
and symbols.

39
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,843
For example,
the replicant Leon is obsessed with 

40
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,394
finding photos because these visual 
symbols reinforced the idea that he has 

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,893
a history proof of having existed.
There's actually a pretty interesting 

42
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,770
postmodern commentary here.
Many philosophers,

43
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,170
including wisecrack favorite genre,
beaudry yard,

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,670
have discussed how all of us now think 
of our past as a series of images,

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
photo albums,
instagram,

46
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,820
facebook,
photos,

47
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:46,470
et cetera.
Our Past,

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,890
like the replicants,
has just become a series of photos,

49
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,660
symbols,
or video images.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,673
Similarly,
the main drive of the protagonists in 

51
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,130
blackout to destroy a database registry 
that lists them as replicants.

52
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,560
By removing these signs that defined 
them as not human,

53
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,790
they are destroying the one thing,
separating them from humanity.

54
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,790
Number two,
the dol in blade runner,

55
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,680
Chris,
a pleasure model,

56
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,450
just like trixie disguises herself.
It's a doll amongst other nonsense toys,

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,620
while in blackout 20 slash 22,
trixie carries a stuffed doll.

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,110
In both cases,
the dol indicates how humans distinguish

59
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:24,944
themselves from replicants.
They're largely considered to be doll 

60
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:30,910
like lifeless Automaton,
but why?

61
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
Philosopher David Hume argues that the 
only thing that distinguishes us from 

62
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
dolls is our experience.
He says that mankind is nothing but a 

63
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,340
bundle or collection of different 
perceptions.

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,413
This bundle theory says that all we are 
is just a collection of experiences and 

65
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,870
memories held together in a sack of 
meat,

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,750
and this is how we define ourselves as 
human,

67
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,010
but as the film points out replicants to
find themselves in the same way,

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,850
even though her memories are 
artificially implanted,

69
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,360
Rachel is convinced of her own humanity 
and even carries a photo of herself as a

70
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,100
child.
Implanted or not.

71
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,590
If you have memories,
what's the difference?

72
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,630
Utilizing their experience,
both trixie and Chris Challenged,

73
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:13,464
they're prescribed faked shedding this 
idea of the doll and asserting their 

74
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,170
humanity.

75
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,900
This is why trixie leaves her doll 
behind as she goes into ass whooping.

76
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,250
So who is to say they're just lifeless 
dolls?

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
Number three,
the dump,

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,670
the final symbol has caused so much 
debate since the release of the original

79
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,504
blade runner and its appearance in 20 
slash 22 makes it all the more 

80
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,920
significant in the original movie Roy,
he gives his famous speech while holding

81
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,800
a dove and releases it just as he 
expires.

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,873
Similarly in 2022,
trixie observes a dub as she sails 

83
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,804
through the air before coming to a 
crashing end herself because of how 

84
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:53,680
briefly the doves are seen and 
importantly when they are seeing,

85
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,450
it's easy to interpret them in a number 
of ways as a symbol of life departing or

86
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,860
alternatively as life continuing or even
as just another Automaton,

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,873
as blade runner suggests,
most organic animals no longer exist if 

88
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,923
you like our own

89
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,110
sort official.
Of course it is.

90
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,123
However,
our favorite interpretation of the dove 

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,390
is that it represents a certain kind of 
freedom.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,433
The sort of freedom the characters yearn
for can be found in what soren 

93
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:24,914
kierkegaard refers to as despair.
Kierkegaard defines despair is the 

94
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:32,390
tension between life and are inevitable 
death and the search for meaning they're

95
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,190
in.
While for Keaker Guard,

96
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:37,670
this was solved by aligning yourself 
with God for the replicants,

97
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,930
no heaven or hell before us.
This world is all gone,

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,720
so like a lot of people living in are 
more secular age.

99
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,703
We free ourselves from this tension or 
despair by being conscious of that 

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,080
understanding and defining ourself,
which is exactly the replicants do.

101
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,293
Roy spends the film fighting this 
tension by searching for more life 

102
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,110
beyond his four year expiration date and
tell when he feels his body beginning to

103
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:10,220
degrade and his end is near.
He chooses to fight his programming as a

104
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:14,750
combat model and spares deckerd.
He then delivers this speech that brings

105
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,860
tears to the eyes of nerds everywhere.

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Oh,
the moment will be lost in time,

107
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,350
like tears,
right,

108
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,280
referring to the bundle of experiences 
that he has seen throughout his life.

109
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,473
Perhaps this indicates that he has 
finally defied his programming by 

110
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,620
defining himself and thus is free of his
existential despair,

111
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,370
even if he didn't get more life.
Unlike in the original movie,

112
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,263
Trixie and Iggy are seeking the power to
allow them to define themselves by 

113
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:58,010
destroying the registry that the humans 
use to define them as replicants.

114
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,143
In doing this,
we see trixie breakaway from her 

115
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:04,760
programming as a pleasure doll and 
become a backflipping baptist,

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,760
thus liberating herself from her 
predetermined role.

117
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,760
In both cases,
freedom must be fought for and claimed.

118
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,880
If a 15 minute prologue by the same 
studio can pack all this sexy stuff than

119
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,770
20,
$49.

120
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,604
Sounds pretty promising and we didn't 
even get into the whole is decorative 

121
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,063
replicant debate,
but that's going to have to wait for 

122
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,590
another time.
For now,

123
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:28,430
be sure to see blackout 20 slash 22 for
