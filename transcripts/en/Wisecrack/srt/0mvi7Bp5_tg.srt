1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,503
Well,
I think that we will probably need some 

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,770
new institutional arrangements before 
this is over.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,340
Um,
one that I've called for,

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:17,951
uh,
in,

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,784
in a number of places including my book 
is it's a world environment 

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,210
organization.
I've worked in the UN,

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,770
I can tell you that,
uh,

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,940
if you look across the landscape of the 
UN agencies,

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,090
uh,
it's probably true that the weakest ones

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,860
are the ones that are there for the 
environment.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,650
Uh,
and that's not good.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
We need a world environment organization
that has the kind of authority and clout

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,630
that the World Trade Organization has.
And that's an easy case to make.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,000
Um,
but,

15
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,834
um,
I think the World Bank could have a big 

16
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:55,350
role.
It could create special arrangements and

17
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:59,190
special facilities to help deal with 
these issues.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,200
And the best thing about the UN program,
uh,

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,470
are in this area are the,
uh,

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,700
you know,
basically the,

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,373
is not appreciated that widely,
but all of the international treaties 

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,620
that worked to protect the environment,
uh,

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,890
most of which the US has never ratified 
a,

24
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,000
but all of those treaties,
uh,

25
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,210
are sponsored by the United Nations.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,553
The these negotiations that happened 
every year to strengthen the climate 

27
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,240
treaty.
Now looking to a post Kyoto Protocol,

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,670
uh,
looking out to 20,

29
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,890
50 to reduce greenhouse gases.
That's,

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,710
uh,
that,

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,543
that,
uh,

32
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,550
that process,
uh,

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,473
is,
is under the Framework Convention on 

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,610
Climate Change,
which is a UN sponsored exercise.

35
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,020
And the secretary at sit service those 
conventions and it's sponsored.

36
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:55,300
The negotiations are UN entities.
Uh,

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,970
and problem is that that system doesn't 
work nearly well enough.

38
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,680
Uh,
it's,

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,990
it's a one country,
one vote,

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,333
a system,
and a country's can whittle down these 

41
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,830
agreements to the point that they're 
toothless.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,673
And the real problem now is not the poor
is not weakened forcement of the 

43
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,030
treaties.
Uh,

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,760
it's not weak compliance with the 
treaties.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,780
It's just,
it's a treaty.

46
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:22,614
So toothless,
they don't require much in the first 

47
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:24,984
place.
And so we need to develop some new 

48
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,600
machinery for international 
negotiations.
