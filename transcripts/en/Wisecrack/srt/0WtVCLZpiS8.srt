1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,900
Well,
the question is,

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,350
if we're entering a new golden age of 
space exploration,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,380
what is the main bottleneck that we 
face?

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,810
The main bottleneck has to do with life 
support and the human.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,240
You see,
we've already said robots.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,270
Tomorrow's,
we've already said objects the size of a

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:29,220
bus to the planet Mars,
but now we're talking about humans which

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,054
require an whole support network and so 
we have to realize that things that we 

9
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:34,944
don't even consider it all with robots 
become central and a bottleneck for 

10
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,004
humans.
Humans have to live in an environment 

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:46,140
where there's radiation,
where this loneliness,

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,790
where the journey could take two years,
where temperatures are below freezing,

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,640
where the atmosphere of pressure is only
one percent.

14
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:58,500
The atmospheric pressure on the planet 
earth and eventually we want to create a

15
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,334
base there.
We're not going to go there just to 

16
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,960
plant the fly and come back and crow 
about it.

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,680
No,
we want a self sustaining a plant,

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,740
a base on Mars that could support 
people.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,530
This means it has to be done in several 
steps.

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,010
The first step would be to create a base
on Mars with power solar power.

21
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:25,440
Can provide the energy and lava tubes 
underground lava tubes,

22
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:26,274
might be able to provide caves by which 
astronauts could live and create the 

23
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,260
first outpost underground.
That's the way it was done in the movie.

24
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,094
Two thousand one.
The moon base on the moon in that movie 

25
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,784
was underground providing a natural 
barrier to radiation and then once you 

26
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:44,724
have the base set up,
you have to begin the process of 

27
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,890
creating a self sustaining agriculture 
there.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,170
I mean,
what are you going to eat on Mars?

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,273
You can order a hamburger because 
everything has to be shipped from the 

30
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,814
planet earth.
You want to create an agriculture and 

31
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,900
this means genetic engineering.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,423
This means creating genetically modified
algae and plants that can consume the 

33
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:08,004
rich carbon dioxide atmosphere,
live in a very cold environment and 

34
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,594
thrive.
Then we have to create mining 

35
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,114
operations.
We have to mine the ice ice can provide 

36
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:19,584
oxygen for breathing water,
for drinking and hydrogen for rocket 

37
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,654
fuel,
and so we have to begin a mining 

38
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:29,700
operation so that we have the materials 
to build cities,

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,360
materials to build bases,
oxygen to breathe,

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,630
water to drink and hydrogen for rocket 
fuel.

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,033
Then the last step in the process,
and this will take maybe another 100 

42
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,340
years,
is to send satellites,

43
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,413
satellites orbiting around Mars to begin
the process of melting the polar 

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,090
icecaps.
This is called space solar power.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,740
We have the blueprints already.
The problem is cost,

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,973
but the costs are dropping for sending 
payloads into artists space 

47
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,200
dramatically,
and so people are,

48
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,034
once again dusting off these old plans 
to create satellites around the earth 

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,153
satellites around Mars that can beam 
energy and begin the process of melting 

50
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,130
the ice caps.

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,443
Now,
once you raise the temperature of Mars 

52
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,904
by about six degrees,
is the temperature of Mars rises 60 

53
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,250
degrees.
It becomes auto catalytic.

54
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,140
It takes off,
it becomes self feeding because the more

55
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,974
heat you have on Mars,
the more carbon dioxide you loft into 

56
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,510
the atmosphere,
which creates more greenhouse effect,

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,583
which allowed you to melt even more ice 
to raise the temperature even more so 

58
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:48,820
you have a positive feedback loop.
The question is,

59
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,090
can we reach six degrees?
That's the key point.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
If we can raise the surface temperature 
of Mars by six degrees,

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,913
we can create this artificial spiral by 
which it feeds on itself and we can 

62
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,800
begin the process of terraforming.
Mars is there.

63
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,810
Remember,
robots don't need terraforming.

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,100
Humans do,
and so to make more suitable for humans,

65
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,930
that's going to be the big problem.
