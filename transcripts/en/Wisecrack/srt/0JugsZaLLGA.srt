1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,080
I have a very strong opinion.
It all revolves overstatement 90 percent

2
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,120
of it revolves around Israel and 
Palestine.

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,213
You have to understand that Palestinians
also bleed and that they also have a 

4
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:30,630
legitimate grievance.
Israelis may also,

5
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,650
but Palestinians in a nutshell are being
punished for something they did not do,

6
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,890
which is commit the Holocaust until 
Palestine or Palestinians are recognized

7
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:45,854
as having a grievance just as much as 
Israelis do and until that grievance is 

8
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,044
addressed and addressed fairly not with 
walls and not with little bits of 

9
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:59,960
settlements scattered across the West 
Bank,

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,430
but until it is equitably and fairly 
finalized,

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,610
you will not.
You will not have peace.

12
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,543
It will take Israel pulling back to the 
1967 borders halting further settlement 

13
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,840
building,
allowing Palestinian refugees to return.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,873
That's what it will take.
That proposal has been on the table 

15
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:30,030
since 2002 from the Arab League and the 
Organization of Islamic Conference.

16
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,763
In exchange for that,
every country in both of those 

17
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,254
organizations will recognize Israel and 
will open up full diplomatic relations 

18
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,290
with them.
Six years.

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,470
That proposal has been on the table.
Israel has refused.

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,470
It's certainly a sympathetic Palestine.
It's certainly,

21
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,373
you know,
when Israel helicopter's fire rockets 

22
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,854
into some street and kill six people,
including a Hamas activist that is 

23
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:10,241
reported that Israel killed six people,
including one activist as opposed to say

24
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:13,574
CNN or Fox,
which will report that Israel killed 

25
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,820
them,
Hamas activist,

26
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,970
and not mention those other people.
But yes,

27
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,650
there are front page photos,
you know,

28
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:29,120
almost every day of the latest outrage.
It's certainly skewed.

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,150
I agree with that.
But you have to look at,

30
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,580
you know,
who is doing,

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,620
who is committing,
frankly,

32
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:41,621
the majority of the violence since 1988.
I don't remember the statistics exactly,

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,730
but something like 10 Palestinians have 
been killed for every Israeli.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,473
Uh,
raise your hand if you've read that in 

35
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,080
the US newspaper lately.
