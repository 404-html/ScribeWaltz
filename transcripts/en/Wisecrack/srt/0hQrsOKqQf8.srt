1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,660
I think we have an example

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,060
where I originally came out of Pacifica 
was founded in 1949 in Berkeley,

3
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:18,850
California by a war resister named Lou 
Hill.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,743
He came out of the detention camps and 
he said there has to be a media outlet 

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,040
that is not run by corporations.
That profit from war,

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,890
um,
that has not run by corporations.

7
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,720
As George Gerbner,
um,

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,790
founder of the cultural environment 
movement,

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,400
former dean at the Annenberg School of 
Communications,

10
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:37,234
University of Pennsylvania said not run 
by corporations that have nothing to 

11
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:45,010
tell and everything to sell that are 
raising our children today.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,910
So pacifica was born the first station 
KPFA in Berkeley in 1949.

13
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:54,070
Second station 10 years later in Los 
Angeles,

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,100
59,
uh,

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Kpf k 1960 Wbai in New York,
1977.

16
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:05,641
WPFW in Washington and 1970 K PFT and 
Houston.

17
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:08,780
Those are the five Pacific istation's.
Um,

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,663
they are the original models of listener
sponsorship that you turn to the 

19
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:15,520
listener and you say,
please,

20
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,160
if you appreciate what you hear,
you don't have to agree with everything.

21
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,383
But if you appreciate this forum for 
people to debate and discuss the 

22
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,390
critical issues of the day,
please support it.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,440
Um,
KP of t when it went on the air in 1970,

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,480
um,
within a few months,

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,373
uh,
the small station Houston was blown off 

26
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:36,250
the year.
Um,

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,113
the Ku Klux Klan blew it up.
They strap dynamite to the base of the 

28
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,194
transmitter.
And I don't know if it was the exalted 

29
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:45,820
cyclops or the Grand Dragon because I 
often confuse their titles,

30
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,043
but they said it was their proudest act,
I think because they understood how 

31
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,264
dangerous Pacifica is dangerous because 
it allows people to speak for 

32
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:57,184
themselves.
And when you hear someone speaking for 

33
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:03,320
themselves,
it breaks down the bigotry,

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,293
the hatred,
the characatures that fueled the hate 

35
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,550
groups.
I think that is a very important model.

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,270
Now,
public radio and television adopted it.

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,940
National Public Radio and PBS,
you know,

38
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:19,780
we all know the listener and viewer fund
drives on the air,

39
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:20,614
but they tended to move away from that 
and they're going to corporate 

40
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,420
underwriting.
Um,

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,550
uh,
more and more.

42
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,500
But Pacific has remained true to that 
idea of listener sponsorship.

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,590
And I think that is a critical model,
um,

44
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,123
for authentic,
independent media in this country 

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,193
around.
