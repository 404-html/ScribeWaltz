1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,000
Here,
he essentially,

2
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,540
his innovation was to recognize from the
start that the campaign is just really a

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,770
bad reality show and he made it a,
a,

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,270
a good reality show.
Now that's not saying that qualitatively

5
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:19,180
he was a good person.
I'm just saying that he knew how to make

6
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,014
good television.
He knew he knew how to attract the 

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,320
eyeballs.
It's entertainment.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,810
If you think about the,
the,

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,693
the financial incentives of everybody 
who's on the bus or on the campaign 

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,374
plane,
you have the candidates who are funded 

11
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:33,090
by a,
you know,

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,270
a very small group of ultra powerful 
commercial donors.

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,670
And then you have the press and they're,
they're,

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,770
they're basically funded by advertising 
dollars.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,633
And so there's this.
Somewhere along the line there was a 

16
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:46,700
synergy between,
um,

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,643
the person who was the most entertaining
on the one hand and who was able to 

18
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:51,520
satisfy the donor class.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,353
And the other hand,
if you find that sweet spot in the 

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,593
middle of those two phenomena,
that's usually where you were going to 

21
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,564
get your candidate a is someone who is a
little bit entertaining and also a 

22
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,160
little bit more flexible as a result of 
that at the,

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,320
at the outset of the campaign,
uh,

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,660
especially,
he was able to attract mountains and,

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,930
you know,
billions of dollars,

26
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:12,950
probably a free coverage,
um,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,833
at a period of the race when other 
candidates have to buy their own 

28
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,504
publicity.
And he made it into a kind of a genuine 

29
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:19,504
revolt,
a where his voters perceive themselves 

30
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:24,484
as to kind of be aggrieved victims of a 
conspiracy of elites that were 

31
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,430
represented by all the,
you know,

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,670
the donors,
the press,

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,020
uh,
the two parties.

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,730
And he managed to get past a lot of the,
the kind of the bulwarks that we usually

35
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,800
had thrown up in the past to keep him.

36
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,450
People like that out.
Like for instance,

37
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,284
um,
normally when a candidate slips up and 

38
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,240
make some mistake,
uh,

39
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:46,810
I'll,
uh,

40
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,643
Howard Dean when he made his scream or 
Gary Hart when it got busted with the 

41
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,400
monkey business photo,
uh,

42
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,263
you know,
we typically used to descend upon a 

43
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:57,274
candidate,
a reporter I know used to call it the 

44
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:00,950
seal of death,
um,

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,801
where,
you know,

46
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,634
we would kind of swirl around a 
candidate with negative attention and 

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,200
that would really be it,
you know,

48
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,440
a few hundred times and they would show,
you know,

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,780
a damning clip and the person would just
exit the scene.

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,903
Uh,
there'd be humiliating public apology 

51
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:17,314
and then a few a drop in the polls and a
few weeks later you wouldn't hear from 

52
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,300
that candidate again.
That didn't happen this time,

53
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,134
this,
the trump managed to survive countless 

54
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:29,620
scandals like that.
And every time everybody expected him to

55
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,600
go down in the polls,
he went up in the polls.

56
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,290
And I think a lot of people in,
in our profession,

57
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,490
we're,
we're kind of flummoxed by that.

58
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,280
They,
he was sort of defined the usual laws of

59
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,800
gravity and we just didn't know what to 
do about it.
