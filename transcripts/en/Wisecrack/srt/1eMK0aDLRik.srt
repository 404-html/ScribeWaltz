1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,240
You have an APP,
I mean there is actually,

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,180
you know,
if you're like a zillion ar,

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,680
you can take a trip to outer space and 
into the international space station.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,750
They're also all these sort of,
you know,

5
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,120
suborbital flights you can take.
Um,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,013
it's,
you know,

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,853
to the tune of $35 million and up.
So it's not a mass industry at this 

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,660
plane.
It's still kind of a niche.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,950
Um,
yeah,

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,270
I think we will,
I think we will,

11
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm not sure if it's 25 years out or 
maybe a little bit longer.

12
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,061
Um,
you know,

13
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,010
Richard Branson is doing some amazing 
things.

14
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,970
He's putting a big bet on it.
Um,

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,600
I think the appeal is there.
I think it's going to become,

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,670
you know,
it's going to be a pretty rarefied group

17
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,740
of people who get to do it.
Um,

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,950
but it's just such a nifty idea to be 
floating above,

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,880
above,
you know,

20
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,950
above the earth and,
um,

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,833
and,
and seeing the curvature of the earth 

22
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,970
and seeing the stars above you.
I,

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,600
you know,
I'd love to do that.

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,980
Um,
I do more of a Middle East.

25
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,240
Absolutely.
Um,

26
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,403
you know,
places like Oman and Yemen Oman's been 

27
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,200
pretty stable for a long time,
but Yemen has been a little,

28
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,330
unless less stable,
I think that's going to come up.

29
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,120
I think Iran is it as an emerging 
destination.

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,020
Um,
you know,

31
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,810
our political relationship with the Ron,
it's terrible right now,

32
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,860
but,
um,

33
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,783
you know,
there were a lot of Europeans going 

34
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,580
there,
a lot of other Asians going there,

35
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,920
and it's magnificent country with a lot 
to offer.

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,900
Um,
same with Pakistan.

37
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,734
You know,
I want to go to Pakistan right now 

38
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,373
because it seems too edgy and Vol tile.
But I think as hopefully as things 

39
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,520
stabilize and situations improve their,
um,

40
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,210
you know,
there's some,

41
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,920
some fantastic things to see that I 
think Americans be interested in seeing.
