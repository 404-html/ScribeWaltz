Hey guys,
jared here and today we're diving back 

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,144
into black mirror.
The fourth season of this modern 

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,820
twilight zone just dropped on Netflix 
and with it some truly thought provoking

7
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:22,821
episodes including a loving homage to 
star trek and Apache helicopter parents,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,540
and they rather utopian alternative to 
tinder in the wake of season three super

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,374
popular San Junipero.
The show has traded it's trademark 

10
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:34,110
pessimism for a slightly more positive 
tone,

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,093
injecting a measure of justice and 
happiness previously unseen in the 

12
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,324
series,
but it's in the season finale where the 

13
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,500
show does something drastically 
different.

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,423
Black Museum not only provides the high 
concept technological nightmare that 

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
we've come to expect,
but reflects on the legacy and function 

16
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,350
of the show.
As a whole,

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,483
black museum asks,
what is even the purpose of Black 

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,540
Mirror?

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,373
Welcome this wise crack quick take on 
the philosophy of black museum and 

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,133
obviously spoilers ahead.
The episode follows a young woman named 

21
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,124
niche as she's given a private tour by 
proprietor Rolo Haynes of the eponymous 

22
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,294
black museum,
a tourist trap that houses a collection 

23
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,900
of authentic criminological artifacts.
Viewers will be sure to spot a number of

24
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:16,734
prominent props from past episodes,
including the DNA analyzer from USS 

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,623
Callister,
the parental control pad from Archangel 

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,903
be bloody bathtub from crocodile,
and even the strange symbol mark ski 

27
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:30,990
masks from White Bear.
These are more than just Easter eggs.

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,863
There are visual clues to the viewer 
that Black Museum is a Meta textual 

29
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,814
reflection of the show itself.
The artifacts that contain serve as a 

30
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,730
physical representation of the episodes 
they appeared in,

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,773
and even the name black museum is 
deliberately evocative of the show's 

32
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:46,074
title Black Mirror like the holiday 
special white Christmas black museum is 

33
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:50,604
an anthology within an anthology with 
three separate subplots loosely 

34
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,834
connected by Rolo Haynes is narration 
and utilizing this same methodology 

35
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:58,950
structure.

36
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,890
Black Museum is mirroring the format of 
black mirror,

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,130
but if the exhibits in the background 
represent past episodes,

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,330
what do the three new gadgets,
Dr Dawson's lymphatic diagnoser,

39
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,283
the monkey stuff with Carrie's 
consciousness and Clayton Lee's 

40
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,254
holographic holding cell represent each 
item is an interface for human 

41
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,844
consciousness,
a more direct means of what television 

42
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:20,934
and social media already do today.
These fictional items represent the 

43
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,804
different ways our current technology 
both connects and disconnects us as a 

44
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,334
society.
Dustin's implant connects him and his 

45
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,440
patients signaling their sensations to 
him via the hairnet.

46
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,274
Looking headgear.
The upload which inserts carries mind 

47
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,064
into the backseat of Jack's brain,
allows her to see and feel as he does 

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,540
and the thin string separating Clayton's
consciousness from the museum.

49
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,374
Visitors creates emotional distance akin
to the distance between fictionalized 

50
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,694
characters and desensitize audiences.
Dawson subplot comments on media's 

51
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,794
ability to let us empathize with 
characters and experience thrills 

52
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,030
without any physical ramifications.

53
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
Imagine if you could feel exactly what a
patient feels minus the physical 

54
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,634
consequences.
Jack and Carrie story reflects media's 

55
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,880
ability to turn us into voyeurs.
Clayton story reflects on the guilt free

56
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,940
gratification we get from consuming 
violence in media.

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,893
In all of these cases,
technology allows individuals to 

58
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,540
experience things vicariously like 
hitchhiker,

59
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,210
like a passenger,
vicarious sensations.

60
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,180
She sees what you see,
she feels what you feel.

61
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,163
This episode dramatizes what all fiction
generally does and what Black Mirror as 

62
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,120
a television program does.
Specifically all fiction is delivered to

63
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,930
us via a medium in the case of black 
mirror through television.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,260
Television itself is enroll those words,
a receiver for human experiences and one

65
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,290
that often,
as Rolo says,

66
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,183
offers no privacy for him,
no agency for her with a particularly 

67
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,614
compelling show like Black Mirror.
We become increasingly invested and 

68
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:03,934
share in the same sense of joy in San 
Junipero as Kelly and Yorkie the same 

69
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,494
indignation as being in 15 million 
merits and the same initial prejudices 

70
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,340
and gradual awakening as stripe in men 
against fire.

71
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,210
For philosopher Martha Nussbaum.
This kind of connection is emblematic of

72
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,640
narratives,
roles in one's moral development.

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,840
Narratives according to Nussbaum free us
from the parochial confines over our own

74
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
lives and place us in a position both 
like and unlike our own like in that we 

75
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,190
are emotionally involved with the 
characters,

76
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,490
active with them and aware of our 
incompleteness,

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,593
unlike in that we're free of certain 
sources of distortion that frequently 

78
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,870
impede our real life deliberations.
For example,

79
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,660
take a character like being in 15 
million merits.

80
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,420
His love for abby might remind us of our
own lives,

81
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:54,040
but unlike being we're not sent on a 
downward spiral when that love is lost,

82
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,190
yet we can still experience it from a 
distance.

83
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,510
Black Museum,
however,

84
00:04:58,511 --> 00:04:59,344
explores the danger of this distancing 
effect through Dr Dawson subplot and 

85
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:03,814
it's here that the episode looks at the 
potentially desensitizing nature of the 

86
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,770
series owned violent imagery,

87
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,210
more pain.
He felt pleasure,

88
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,930
God

89
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,720
in a series which premiered with the 
prime minister of Britain.

90
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,023
A pig.
Maintaining that same sense of shock 

91
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,720
requires increasingly more shocking 
scenes.

92
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,643
Bus,
they need to surprise audiences in shut 

93
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,390
up and dance.
By revealing that the protagonist they'd

94
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,800
been rooting for had been into Kiddie 
porn,

95
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,480
only to

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,940
be topped in the subsequent season in 
crocodile.

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,953
As we experienced an average human being
transitioned from innocence to 

98
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,160
infanticide because a baby per rolo.
As the show progressed,

99
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,023
our relationship with pain had shifted.
We're not merely desensitized to the 

100
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:51,824
violence on screen.
We take a twisted kind of pleasure in 

101
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,900
the discomfort it inflicts upon us.
See,

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,590
it's like eating chilis,
your climate eyes fast.

103
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,890
First Time we had a Jalapeno that you 
spat it out too hot,

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,770
persevere,
and it becomes addictive,

105
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,873
but black museum is ultimately not 
apologetic for engaging in such extreme 

106
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,374
emotions,
arguing through its third subplot that 

107
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,580
the show is not empty.
Sensationalism,

108
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,990
but rather has a purpose motivating it 
in the main exhibit of Black Museum.

109
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,040
We see what remains of Clayton Lee,
the alleged murderer who is arrested.

110
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,420
Execution had been alluded to throughout
the episode like carrying the Monkey.

111
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,343
His consciousness continues on even 
after the exploration of his physical 

112
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,364
body.
I'll be at this time as a self aware 

113
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,884
hologram.
As the museum's grand attraction 

114
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,240
visitors are invited to pull the switch 
themselves,

115
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,910
not merely inflicting real torture on 
this Lee,

116
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,893
but in the process creating a sentience 
souvenir that eternally experiences the 

117
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,621
moment of execution.
It was beautiful juicing him out.

118
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,520
Subconscious session,
snapshot of Clayton,

119
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,533
not a recording,
a true copy of his mind perpetually 

120
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:04,700
experiencing that,
but stuck

121
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,920
forever in that one.
Perfect.

122
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,643
Similar to white Christmas in which the 
cookie of Joe is confined to a virtual 

123
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:16,430
cabin for what he experiences as 
hundreds of thousands of years.

124
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,550
It's the punishment made perpetual that 
most offenders,

125
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,940
our innate sense of proportionality,
even if he committed the crime,

126
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,300
no finite offense could merit infinite 
punishment.

127
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,120
As such,
the show forces us to empathize with one

128
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:29,954
character who may be a murderer and 
another absolutely guilty of 

129
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:33,824
manslaughter and a child on Christmas.
We don't merely feel bad for them from 

130
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:40,100
the safe distance of our side of the 
screen.

131
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,070
We feel their pain with them.
Likewise,

132
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:43,904
we feel a sense of vindication when our 
audience surrogate niche revealed to be 

133
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:49,940
Clayton's daughter and carrying her 
mother inside her head,

134
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,913
enact retribution against Rolo.
It's not just that niche seeing the 

135
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:58,340
suffering of her father or hearing the 
story of Kerry engender empathy in her.

136
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,390
It's that such empathy then motivated 
her to moral action.

137
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,463
This is black museum state went about 
how Black Mirror sees itself and its 

138
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:07,544
purpose.
It's not desensitizing spectacle and 

139
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:10,694
empty entertainment.
It's not even a cautionary tale about 

140
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:13,814
the dangers of technology after all,
the same mind sharing method which 

141
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,474
caused Jack so much.
Grief is shown as being beneficial to 

142
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:20,984
niche and her mother rather black mirror
sees itself as serving the same role as 

143
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,514
a long line of literature and science 
fiction shows which connect us 

144
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,960
emotionally to their characters in order
to engender empathy and in turn,

145
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,380
encourage us to enact justice in the 
episode arc.

146
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,560
Angel Art empathetic attachment to the 
constantly surveilled.

147
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,394
Sarah is supposed to incite us against 
similar big mother surveillance systems 

148
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,370
pervading our lives or in the episode 
metal head.

149
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,204
Our investment in Bella survival against
what is essentially Boston dynamics is 

150
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:56,021
big dog invites us to scrutinize the 
militarization of autonomous machines in

151
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
all these cases,
black communities able to raise our 

152
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,274
concerns for these societal issues as 
effectively as it does only because it 

153
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,240
first causes us to care for the 
characters it's crafted.

154
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,283
Black Museum is the whole of the show.
Black Mirror distilled down to a single 

155
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,070
episode preserving the same content,
the same format,

156
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,993
and most importantly the same purpose to
see ourselves reflected in the black 

157
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:22,110
mirror that is our television screen or 
smartphone.

158
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,153
Engaging empathetically with the 
characters were connected to buy that 

159
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,454
screen and by doing so,
expanding our moral imagination and 

160
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:33,450
motivating us towards justice.
Thanks for watching guys.

doesn't have to be a harbinger of doom.
