00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,030
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,980
I am your host Garrick's,
where amyloid,

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,993
this week's artifact is up the film that
mandated the Pixar rules that adults 

7
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:26,230
should cry as much as possible.
The film follows human boy,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,093
Carl Marx,
whose dream is to control the means of 

9
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,030
production so we can go to Paradise 
Falls,

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,770
New Jersey,
just like his hero,

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,663
Vladimir Lenin.
One day a homeless girl named Ellie 

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,830
breaks his arm.
They naturally fall in love,

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,664
and before you know it,
she dies just like all great 

14
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:45,970
relationships.
Anyway,

15
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:46,804
the neighborhood's getting gentrified,
which doesn't sit right with Carl who 

16
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:52,540
knows a thing or two about sitting.
In fact,

17
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,240
the thought of capitalism drives Carl so
bonkers.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,133
He assaults Bob the builder,
and with no other options flees the 

19
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:01,180
country and a pitiful excuse for an 
escape pod.

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,223
Little does Carl know that a prediabetic
cub scout is stowed away to earn his 

21
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,210
badge for the mile high club.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,250
Maybe it's those glasses because Carl 
can't see they're heading into a tornado

23
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,203
or why kids love cinnamon toast crunch.
They narrowly survive and land right 

24
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:19,780
where they wanted to go without having 
to ask for directions.

25
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:20,614
Once Karen,
they go the rest of their journey on 

26
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:23,914
foot and take the house with them.
Since there is no valet but not before 

27
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:31,750
befriending a talking horse.
Hi there and famous American actor Kevin

28
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,670
Bacon,
who legend has it was six degrees taller

29
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:41,530
than everyone in Hollywood,
but not so fast and the furious 15,

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,483
a group of other angrier,
more talkative horses all want a piece 

31
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:50,491
of Kevin's bacon because I mean who 
doesn't unable to get a selfie.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,633
They take Carl and the scout to their 
leader because that's what minions do 

33
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,294
best.
They're taken to a Blimpie's where they 

34
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:00,820
learn the Pepsi twist.
Lennon has been in New Jersey this whole

35
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,370
time trying to cast Kevin in a snuff 
film.

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,830
Carl tells the boy scout not to be a 
narc,

37
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,800
but as blood sugar spikes and he blabs 
that's my new giant bird pet.

38
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,180
They make a sweet escape.
Remembering that horses don't flip,

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,733
but just like my ex wife,
Lenin is two steps ahead and as lit the 

40
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,530
house on fire,
Kevin gets burdened down,

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,480
so carl goes back to his original plan 
of I guess dying in the Wilderness after

42
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,314
two days.
That is until he finds an Amazon nook 

43
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,510
giving him the proper motivation to 
enter the third act,

44
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,560
a battle royale ensues,
but not without some warmup stretching,

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,980
always stretch.
Carl,

46
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:42,730
let's his house go to and Lennon 
realizes he could have learned something

47
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:45,670
from Kevin Bacon,
namely how to get footloose,

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,820
Carl reunites,
Kevin with his bulimic children and back

49
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,654
in the big city,
which has probably been freaking out 

50
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:57,370
nonstop that someone was able to just 
fly away using balloons.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,000
Carl gives the boy scouts some tin that 
said best.

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,193
Extremely heartwarming up illustrates 
the dangers of being trapped by 

53
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,320
nostalgia,
which wasn't cured until 20,

54
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,810
67 by Dr Millie.
Bobby Brown,

55
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,823
when his fwb dies.
Carl metaphorically and trines her in 

56
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,370
the house that they built together.
He keeps everything exactly as it was to

57
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:22,090
preserve her memory and to keep her 
ghost happy outside.

58
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:22,924
The world may keep trucking,
but Carl clings to the past even though 

59
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:29,530
he may be in the Matrix.
The house itself symbolizes corals,

60
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,364
grief,
which he has to carry with them until 

61
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,614
the housing market improves.
Lenin is in many ways Carl's foxy or 

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,953
counterpart like Carl's condo linens.
Air Ship is a museum of artifacts from 

63
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,584
better times like the Jurassic Age and 
his mission of Redemption Parallels 

64
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,680
Carol's journey.
Eight called me a fraud.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Those should I bring back this creature 
and my name will be cleared,

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,180
but just as Carl can't bring his wife 
back,

67
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,014
no matter how many houses he knocks up,
Lennon can't bring back the glory days 

68
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,670
through sniping the snipe.

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,593
In fact,
a snipe hunt is a colloquial term for a 

70
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,264
wild grey goose chase.
We're in a naive person is fooled into 

71
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:11,670
chasing after something that doesn't 
exist like love up.

72
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,910
A poignant message about coping with 
grief and a healthy gluten free way.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,953
At first,
Carl cares about nothing besides his 

74
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,354
super dead wife,
but as he develops affection for the 

75
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,904
scout and Kevin Bacon,
he develops a new selfless purpose that 

76
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:25,744
helps him move on to save the day.
Carl must divest himself of the past by 

77
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,914
littering.
When Carl passes on the badge that Lee 

78
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,674
gave him as a child,
we realized her memory has transformed 

79
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,974
from a burden around his neck to 
something positive that he can share 

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,693
once hobbled by grief,
the new Carl abandoned his walker and 

81
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:44,350
can once again move freely through the 
world.

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,300
You know what Gabe of proving once and 
for all Western medicine was a lie.

83
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,150
The film posits that instead of bold 
adventures,

84
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:55,090
the best pursuits are the simple 
pleasures of everyday life,

85
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,210
like enjoying a cup of Joe on the porch 
of your spaceship.

86
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,463
In the beginning,
Russel claims he wants to explore 

87
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,270
unknown lands and claim them for the boy
scouts of America,

88
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,663
but his happiest moments are his 
memories about eating dippin dots with 

89
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:11,030
his deadbeat dad,

90
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,400
I always get chocolate and he gets 
butterfree.

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,673
Might sound boring,
but I think the boring stuff is the 

92
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,960
stuff I remember the most

93
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,760
for all of Lennon's glorious exploits.
He's more alone than Florida.

94
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,594
Mom on sector five at Christmas,
and while the childhood portion of 

95
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,620
Ellie's adventure book is full of dreams
of paradise falls,

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,280
the mature Ellie filled the book with 
Raci photographs of her life.

97
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,114
With Carl.
The moral is to enjoy the simple things 

98
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,503
like the love and companionship of a 
friend and avoid the bad things like 

99
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:42,854
kidnapping and trafficking,
a minor to South America for earthlink 

100
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,210
cinema.
I'm Garrett.

101
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,070
Formula.
Adventure is out there.

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,530
Hey,
why's cry?

103
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,880
