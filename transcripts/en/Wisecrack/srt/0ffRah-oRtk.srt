1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,920
Leaders or the one smart enough to hire 
people smarter than them,

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,583
but that's the first thing you do.
You've got to get four or five people 

3
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:16,640
that are smarter than you guys have to 
work together.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,250
You guys have to,
you know,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,130
start from the bottom,
think about all the good ideas and think

6
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:25,820
about all the bad ideas.
And if the good outweighs the bad,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,700
then you should go with the bad.
Always good,

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,440
then you should probably think about 
something else.

9
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:35,441
But that's always been my philosophy and
I have guys that are very intelligent,

10
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:39,200
very smart work for me with my ideas,
their intelligence,

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,063
my intelligence.
It's been working out pretty good so 

12
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:45,050
far.
It's not a dictatorship,

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,610
uh,
act as a leader,

14
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:49,100
but I take input from everybody like,
Hey,

15
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:50,600
I don't think we should do this,
or hey,

16
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:51,680
I think it's a good idea.

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,630
So,
you know,

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,473
most of the time I am kind of voting 
without going through the voting 

19
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,264
process.
So let's just say it's five of us and 

20
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,090
three says,
I don't think we should do it.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,300
Says we should do it.
Probably won't do it.

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,940
But you know,
when you're on a team and you have to do

23
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,774
everything collaboratively and you know,
sometimes you're not going to get along 

24
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:10,610
and sometimes you're going to have an 
argument,

25
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,500
but the respect factor is always there 
and uh,

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,200
you know,
as long as you respect each other,

27
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,940
you know,
treat everyone with respect and,

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,460
you know,
just listened to everybody's views.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,280
It's okay.
You know,

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,870
one of my favorite books is the one 
minute manager.

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,220
So,
you know,

32
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,053
when I'm listening to my guys,
first thing is I don't act like I know 

33
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,160
at all.
So I hear suggestions,

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,013
I put it.
My suggestion is that we have a couple 

35
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,150
meetings and then we just ironed it out 
and we just figured it out.

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,510
I learn every day,
uh,

37
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,380
you know,
but no,

38
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,263
the good thing that's,
that has brought me along the way as I 

39
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,060
know how to win championships.
I know how to build teams.

40
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,670
So I,
I have great teammates surrounding me.

41
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:49,340
And so,
you know,

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,770
anytime I get into a venture,
uh,

43
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,590
most of the time we know what we're 
doing and if it's a problem,

44
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,240
we figured out as a team.
