more on loot crate at the end of the 
video.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,940
Hey,
wise crack.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,850
Not a pickle.
Jared here and today we're breaking down

6
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:18,390
the season finale of rick and morty.
Season three in this season,

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,253
especially rick and Morty,
continues to flump the meaninglessness 

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,640
of our existence.
Nobody gets it.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,430
Nothing you think matters matters.
This is special.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,283
This,
this is happening infinite times across 

11
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,214
infinite realities.
Every time the show's teased us with an 

12
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,700
authentic moment of love or motion,
it's ripped it right out from Andress.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,683
My grandpa was my hero.
Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I 

14
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,714
came home without you and your sister.
So now you know the real reason I 

15
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,350
rescued you.
I just took over the family.

16
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,690
Morning.
This leaves an interesting challenge for

17
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,800
creating a TV show.

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,770
How do you have characters grow when 
there is no meaning?

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,903
Well,
let's show it gives us a novel solution 

20
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:52,854
that's a little better than just 
spiraling deeper into nihilism 

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,393
guarantee.
You're going to die if you touch me and 

22
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:59,160
there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black,

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,023
don't do it,
and that growth isn't from the titular 

24
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,814
protagonist,
but the matriarch of the Smith family 

25
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:05,963
wasn't list wisecrack quick take on the 
rick and morty and of course spoilers 

26
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,621
ahead.
Okay,

27
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,740
so first a quick recap.
Rick and morty are called in to help the

28
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,750
president with some x files,
shenanigans,

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,810
but soon for of helping out the leader 
of the free world.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,350
Rick and the president began an ever 
escalating Dick waving contest,

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,273
the to unleash their vast arsenals 
against each other before rick has a 

32
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,250
more pressing matter to attend to Jerry 
out.

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,250
The more interesting subplot,
however,

34
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,890
is best fresh off the events of episode 
nine.

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,813
Beth begins to question whether or not 
she had taken rick's offer to be 

36
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:43,020
replaced by a clone and if she in fact 
is the clone to settle the matter.

37
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,854
She seeks the help of Jerry who 
recreates one of their first dates and 

38
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:49,370
rekindles their love,
but still worried she's gone.

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,370
Blade runner,
Beth,

40
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:54,270
runs off to the woods with the family or
rick shows up to kill Jerry and convince

41
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,060
her that she's not a clone.
And our last quick take,

42
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,720
we talked about rick informing Beth of 
what her intelligence actually means,

43
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,703
my evil worse.
You're smart when you know nothing 

44
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:06,720
matters.
The Universe is yours and I've never met

45
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,270
a universe that was into it.
Rick's answer to all this,

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,530
of course,
as we know,

47
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,930
is don't think about it.
Faced with this,

48
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,570
Beth has given radical freedom to choose
her destiny.

49
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
In this freedom brings her solace about 
her choice to stay with or leave her 

50
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,530
family,
regardless of which choice she makes.

51
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,503
I don't know if I can do it.
Then stay and luxuriate in a life you 

52
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:29,010
can finally know you've chosen my secret
bonuses,

53
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,010
that no matter what you choose,
you're finally going to chill the Scout.

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,460
But this episode seems to suggest that 
she chose to stay.

55
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,800
Matthew crazy bitch.
You're my daughter.

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,693
And as a new found sense of happiness,
she's being a better mother to summer 

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,860
sort of.
I just put it on for finding now.

58
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,910
I can't buy it.
Oh,

59
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:46,440
come on.
You look great.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,333
You're only young ones.
Just promise if the results are too 

61
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,460
strong,
you'll use protection.

62
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,340
Finally loves Jerry and has brought her 
family back together.

63
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,260
Real family.
Now,

64
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,450
in many ways things will be like season 
one,

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,373
but for some it may seem kind of weird 
that she suddenly rekindled her love 

66
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,900
with the helpless parasite.
That is Jerry.

67
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,450
We could apply some of the philosophical
themes we've identified in earlier quick

68
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:11,380
takes here like starts bad faith and 
radical freedom,

69
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,423
alienation versus agency,
but I'm going to propose something a 

70
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,604
little new to explain why Beth 
reconnects with Jerry and her overall 

71
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,300
paradigm shift.

72
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm more Fati the cure for common 
nihilism.

73
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,943
Now,
what really made me think of this is 

74
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,580
this moment,
my memory is of hating that night,

75
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,563
but now reliving at all I can feel is 
how lucky I am to be loved by such a 

76
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,000
simple,
honest,

77
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,210
simple man.
This isn't the woman you married,

78
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,680
Jerry Beth worried she's the clone must 
now confront and question her past.

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,770
Not only is she still thinking about 
rick's original proposition,

80
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,663
the ability to flee her past,
but as a possible clone or those 

81
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:53,380
memories even her own and what does that
mean for her future or her happiness are

82
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,253
more fati.
Is a Latin phrase that spreading each 

83
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,610
meister use that means love of fate.
A more [inaudible] is the affirmation of

84
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,400
life being what Nietzsche called a yes 
sayer.

85
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,650
Not to be confused with the pervasive 
corporate.

86
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,260
Yes ma'am,
and it's tied to a thought experiment.

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,140
Many refer to as eternal recurrence to 
simplify.

88
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,400
Imagine a demon shows up and says he's 
going to groundhog day your whole life.

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,303
You get thrown into existential despair 
because you have to infinitely relive 

90
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,223
questionable life moments like the 
popularity of smash mouth and frosting 

91
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:26,810
your tips and middle school,
or do you to paraphrase Nietzsche,

92
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,783
high five,
the demon and say you've never heard of 

93
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,214
anything more defined to want to relive 
everything that's happened in your life 

94
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,810
for eternity.
The good,

95
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:35,644
the bad,
and everything in between is the 

96
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,653
ultimate affirmation of life.
It's a more foggy and it's part of 

97
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,830
Nietzsche's grand plan to escape the 
crushing nihilism of existence.

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,540
Given Beth's existential crisis and 
proclivity for rick like disillusionment

99
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,450
causing intelligence.
Beth has to confront her past.

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,280
I came to you for help and now I'm 
insulting your intelligence and look,

101
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,250
we're intelligence gets you and with 
Jerry,

102
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,230
she gets to relive a small part of it.

103
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,810
I just thought it lips don't sweat and 
yes,

104
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,130
you may have hated her life the first 
time around,

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,680
including her date with Jerry.
This time around,

106
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,710
she'll be that Nietzschean yes,
saving,

107
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,780
but I don't think Beth is rewriting the 
past either.

108
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,100
Just didn't deny the years of misery she
has endured a more Fati isn't about some

109
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,650
kind of.
Everything is a blessing in disguise,

110
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:25,420
but it's more about not to shun the ugly
aspects of our lives as she tells Jerry,

111
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,320
she's no longer the woman he married and
sure Jerry may be an idiot,

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,133
but maybe simplicity is what a person 
with a family history of using 

113
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:35,884
intelligence to justify sickness needs.
We see another amore fati moment when 

114
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:40,601
Beth.
Thanks.

115
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,420
Rick has come to retire.
Her.

116
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,700
I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her,

117
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:49,240
but I don't relate to her.
She left her family and me,

118
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,860
which means I relate to them.

119
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,770
Brushing aside the blade runner,
remiss of it all.

120
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,220
Beth is also functionally saying yes,
a version of Beth have chosen to leave,

121
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,054
but I will embrace being left with my 
family rather than dwell on what could 

122
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:04,250
have been and if you let me extrapolate 
a bit.

123
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,173
While there may be infinite universes 
where rick and Beth has made infinitely 

124
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,220
different choices,
she wants to stay in this one.

125
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,283
As Nietzsche says,
my formula for greatness is a more fati 

126
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,960
that one wants nothing to be different,
not in the future,

127
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,270
not in the past,
not for all eternity.

128
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,373
While meat,
you didn't necessarily philosophize 

129
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,534
about infinite realities,
he did write about the impossible task 

130
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,870
of knowing oneself.
I'm out of excuses to not be who I am.

131
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,840
So who am I?
What do I do?

132
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,200
Beth doesn't know who she is,
but desperately wants to.

133
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,710
For Niki,
the logic of why we actually do anything

134
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,400
is impenetrable,
and if we want to apply this Nietzschean

135
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,243
framing to rick,
we the fans almost never know what 

136
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,520
actually drives him.

137
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,230
Why would you do that for me?
I don't know.

138
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:52,580
Maybe you matter so little that I like 
you or maybe it makes you matter.

139
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,473
Maybe I love you,
so while Beth confront about whether or 

140
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:56,144
not she chose to be cloned or whether or
not any of it matters in the infinite 

141
00:06:59,061 --> 00:06:59,894
versions of herself,
Nietzsche would say it really doesn't 

142
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,850
matter.
All we can do is love our faith and that

143
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,710
seems to be the choice that Beth is 
made.

144
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,140
And to me,
this is really interesting because while

145
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:12,500
the show is often portrayed,
rick as a kind of Nietzschean,

146
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,990
Uber Manch at war with the meaningless 
cosmos,

147
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,840
there is no god in your face,
but rick and uh,

148
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:22,010
quite an uber menschy way doesn't really
create his own new meaning as much as he

149

00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,810
Beth,
on the other hand,

151
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,350
