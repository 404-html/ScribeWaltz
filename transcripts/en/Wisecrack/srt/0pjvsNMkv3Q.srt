1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,590
There's one way to be rational.
There are many ways to be irrational.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,710
We could be irrational by getting 
confused,

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,600
not taking actions,
being myopic,

4
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:14,680
vindictive,
emotional,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,690
you name it.
There's lots of ways to be wrong.

6
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,540
And because of that,
there's not one way to fix it.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,470
But one interesting way to try and 
inject some rationality is to think from

8
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:26,464
an outsider's perspective.
So here's what happens when you think 

9
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,604
about your own life,
you're trapped within your own 

10
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:32,914
perspective,
your tribe within your own emotions and 

11
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:39,580
feelings and so on.
But if you give advice to somebody else,

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,120
all the sudden you're not trapped within
that emotional,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,060
um,
combination,

14
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,920
mishmash,
complexity.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,053
And you can give advice that is more 
forward looking and not so specific to 

16
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,394
the emotions.
So one idea is to basically ask people 

17
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:01,520
for advice.
So if you're falling in love with some,

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,063
some person,
a good advice is to go to your mother 

19
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:05,891
and say,
mother,

20
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:09,820
what do you think about the longterm 
compatibility of that person?

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,650
You're infatuated,
right?

22
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:12,484
When you're infatuated,
you're not able to see things three 

23
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,330
down,
three months down the road.

24
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:17,500
You're saying,
I'm infatuated.

25
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,780
I'll stay in fragile forever.
This will never go away.

26
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:22,510
Your mother being an outsider is not 
infatuated.

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,530
And she could probably look at things 
like longterm compatibility and so on,

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,800
eh,
but there's other ways to do it,

29
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,410
which is not to be advisors to other 
people,

30
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:35,740
but to be advisors for ourselves.
So for example,

31
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:37,630
in one experiment,
Eh,

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,800
we asked people,
we said,

33
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,300
look,
you went to your doctor,

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,223
they gave you this diagnosis.
You know that the thing that the doctor 

35
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:48,220
recommended is much more expensive and 
there are other things that will be much

36
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:49,650
cheaper.
Eh?

37
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,960
Would you go for a second opinion?
And people say,

38
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:54,790
no,
my doctor recommended it.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,060
How could I not take their advice?
How could I say?

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,370
Can you please refer me for a second 
opinion?

41
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,860
Then we asked another group,
we said,

42
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,770
here's the situation.
If this happened to your friend,

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,340
would you recommend that they go for a 
second opinion?

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
People said,
absolutely.

45
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,490
How could you not go for a second 
opinion?

46
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,680
So one idea is to try and get ourselves 
from an outside perspective.

47
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,530
You look at the situation and then you 
say to yourself,

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
if this was about somebody else,
some of the I love and care about,

49
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,620
and they,
when this situation,

50
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,820
what would,
why,

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,713
what would I advise them?
And you would realize that often your 

52
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:34,420
advice will be different and often a 
more rational,

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,100
useful perspective.
