00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,100
This episode is brought to you by wix.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,430
What's up guys?
Jared here and today we're talking about

3
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:13,660
these surprising headscratcher have a 
season finale for South Park season 22,

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,853
the final two episodes unfulfilled and 
bike parade or the first and probably 

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,190
only time you'll see the show quoting 
the communist manifesto,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,233
and from their very essence,
the oppressed worker will eventually 

7
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:28,810
strike back at those capitalists who 
controlled the means of production.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,423
We have nothing to lose,
but our chains so have matt stone and 

9
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:36,550
Trey Parker turned against big business 
like the Denisons of South Park.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,683
Well,
let's find out in this wisecrack 

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,450
addition on the finale of South Park 
season 22 and obviously spoilers ahead,

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,643
but before we get started,
I want to give a quick shout out to our 

13
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:49,930
sponsors over at wix.
Wix is the easiest way to create awesome

14
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:52,780
professional websites.
As I mentioned in an earlier video,

15
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:55,090
I'm trying to make some side money doing
voiceover work.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,510
So let me show you how I created my 
professional site with voice samples.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,350
So here when to create a website for 
myself and you can see they have a whole

18
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:05,010
bunch of options.
So a business now,

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,123
designer photography.
Now I want to build a portfolio and CV 

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,300
and yeah,
I pretty much suck at computers.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,570
It turns out there's already a template 
for voiceover artists.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,290
I picked a style and within minutes I 
was dragging and dropping my audio files

23
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,550
and Bam,
done.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,180
Now I have a site I can send to 
potential clients and it looks good.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,880
So if you're looking to up your game 
before 2019,

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,803
go to wix.com/wise
crack or click the link in the 

27
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:36,001
description to start making your free 
website today and now back to the show.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,810
All right guys.
First,

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,310
a quick recap in unfulfilled and Amazon 
fulfillment center comes to town where a

30
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,144
workplace accident crushes.
A guy named Josh and surviving organs 

31
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:50,140
are crammed in a box.
The box opens.

32
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,974
I spill out and guide his box.
Oregon's agitate for working class 

33
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:54,334
rebellion,
causing Amazon's employees to go on 

34
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,280
strike.
Meanwhile,

35
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,770
the kids want to flex at the bike parade
to get girls,

36
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,950
but can't deck out their bikes without 
their Amazon packages.

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,053
Then in bike parade mall workers tried 
to break the strike and anyone willing 

38
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:10,120
to help Jeff Bezos gets their orders 
fulfilled.

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,870
Once Kenny's newfound socialist beliefs 
ruined their plans for the parade.

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,873
Yeah,
I can do the bike.

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,853
Why not?

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,930
Commodity fetishism the boys try to get 
it canceled.

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,580
Meanwhile,
Randy struggling.

44
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:25,414
We'd business gets a boost from everyone
jones for their Amazon packages stoned 

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,713
in content.
The citizens of South Park realized 

46
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:36,010
they'd rather keep their tegrity than 
suck [inaudible] to figure out what Matt

47
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:39,580
and Trey are saying about the economy.
We have to start with this intro montage

48
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,080
of the Amazon fulfillment center.

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,120
You load 16 tons a day,
older and deeper in debt.

50
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,090
The song playing 16 tons has a million 
covers,

51
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:51,924
but the original was written by Merle 
Travis about the life of coal miners in 

52
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,214
Kentucky.
The song highlights the troubles of 

53
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,584
living in company hounds.
A common practice that faded out in the 

54
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,810
middle of the 20th century.
Company towns were places where a single

55
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,010
employer dominated economic life,
sometimes companies would open a factory

56
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:13,060
and literally build the housing schools 
and hospitals for its employees,

57
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,210
but more importantly,
companies would pay their employees with

58
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,044
their own version of vbox bucks that 
were only redeemable at company owned 

59
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,704
businesses.
What resulted was functionally slavery 

60
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,424
with extra steps workers could never 
move because all their savings were 

61
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,170
useless outside of the company store dot

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,690
or don't check out on MCOs,
go

63
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,483
to the company stone and running up a 
debt at the company store would further 

64
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,880
obligate you to stay until you paid it 
off.

65
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,600
So it South Park Calling Amazon a modern
day company town.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,010
Sure Amazon isn't paying people in prime
box and there's no debt slavery either,

67
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,090
but Amazon does seem to infiltrate every
aspect of south park life.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,310
Once you got on tap,
Amazon,

69
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:59,970
Amazon light and Amazon Ipa,
but especially in episode 10,

70
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:00,804
we see that the primary motivation for 
working at Amazon is to buy your kids 

71
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:08,040
more stuff from Amazon.
Mr Stacia's motivation for going back to

72
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,230
work is to have his orders fulfilled for
butters,

73
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,990
peacock bike and like the Merle Travis 
Song,

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,920
your paycheck has a way of ending up 
right back into the company store,

75
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,590
loading up forklift,
getting paper cuts from boxes,

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,693
and for what a measly paycheck.
They just barely covers our online 

77
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,390
purchases

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,223
and while the people of south part in 
theory could take their real dollars to 

79
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,674
some other businesses to show hints at 
how big business coming to town can 

80
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,690
create eight,
not so free market.

81
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,810
When the boys try to find supplies to 
protest the bike parade,

82
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,940
all the other businesses have gone 
under.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,960
When the Amazon fulfillment center open 
to everything else went out of business.

84
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,720
A similar dynamic happens not just with 
Amazon,

85
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,950
but Walmart were low paid employees only
had enough money to shop at Walmart.

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,590
You get a discount working here 10 
percent.

87
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,933
That means the baguettes or even better,
ensuring the destruction of local 

88
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:00,340
businesses driving more people to work 
at Walmart and.

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,353
Well,
you get it.

90
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,590
This problem seems encapsulated by Jeff 
Bezos is term consumer worker

91
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,070
Lauren,
between classes,

92
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,340
customers and workers.
At us,

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,130
all I've done is create the new class,
the consumer worker

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,100
doubling down on the same sense of 
resignation that pervades the season.

95
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,053
People support a company they don't even
like because they feel they don't have 

96
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,804
any choice.

97
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,140
I want to quit working for Amazon.
I want to join my friends and striking,

98
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:30,890
but I know that you have to have your 
stuff to be happy.

99
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,163
This hopelessness is also a nod to the 
real life bidding war to host Amazon 

100
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:37,300
second headquarters.
As you probably know,

101
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,430
Matt stone and Trey Parker are 
libertarians,

102
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,264
and the last two episodes seem to 
further a criticism of government 

103
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,624
involvement in the market,
specifically the way business minded 

104
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,654
politicians get in bed with giant 
corporations to create a grotesque 

105
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,630
version of the free market.
If the workers are selling their soul to

106
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:53,464
the company,
store towns and governments are selling 

107
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,040
their soul to Jeff Bezos is throbbing.

108
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,353
We had a deal.
You told me this town would be the 

109
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,680
perfect place for one of our fulfillment
centers.

110
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,613
The creation of jobs holds local 
governments functionally hostage to 

111
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,094
their whims.
Perhaps you should no longer be a prime 

112
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,630
member,
and while,

113
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:12,464
yes,
Amazon fulfillment centers are a good 

114
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,190
example,
you could easily replace Amazon with any

115
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:20,510
sports stadium or manufacturer seeking 
tax breaks that forced local governments

116
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,960
into a race to the bottom and deals that
leave them another day,

117
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,210
older and deeper in debt.
In short,

118
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,073
the show criticizes the imbalance of 
power between companies like Amazon and 

119
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,034
local communities and their workers.
Amazon dehumanizes the strikers when 

120
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,010
their status is downgraded from rhyme to
Amazon.

121
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,820
USD.
A choice as in me and Josh does humanity

122
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:43,970
is exactly what gets him killed when 
Amazon labels is death.

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,073
Human error.
So is there any escape from this 

124
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,850
nightmare?
Well,

125
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,630
sort of as randy bemoans the strike 
messing up his business,

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,210
customers start lining up at his door.
Hey,

127
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:58,070
are you selling weed?
Uh,

128
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:58,904
yeah.
My wife is going nuts not getting her 

129
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,124
packages.
I told her I find her some Kush local 

130
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,284
competition soon forces randy to 
optimize convenience by delivering weed 

131
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,940
to people's homes.
Starting an APP.

132
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,030
We haven't happened out and even a 
membership program,

133
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,860
we're just making sure folks are aware.

134
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,690
In other words,
he becomes the Amazon over week.

135
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,760
So what is South Park trying to say 
here?

136
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,140
Well,
on the one hand,

137
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,003
that integrity in business usually 
doesn't mean going all the way back to 

138
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,624
the gnomes episode of season two.
We see that small business can be just 

139
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:32,510
as evil and exploitative as big bad 
horror books.

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,060
We're just using those boys for our 
benefit.

141
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,163
They have no idea what they're saying,
but kids are great to get people on our 

142
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,070
side and 20 years later South Park's 
message hasn't deviated much.

143
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,960
You know what they got?
They got these days.

144
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,360
You mean the things that almost killed 
us on Halloween?

145
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,194
Yeah.
I remember.

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,150
Why do we use scooters to get directly 
to the customers?

147
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,083
Those things that were once devoid of 
tegrity are now the vehicles with which 

148
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:04,770
he sells tegrity wheat and of course the
episode ends with this.

149
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,130
You come in giant online retailer near 
you complain all you want about hotbox,

150
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,373
Walmart or Amazon.
They're just going to get replaced by 

151
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:17,730
something equally sinister because at 
the end of the day,

152
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,840
if I don't get my gamecube adapter for 
smash brothers by Wednesday,

153
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,570
I swear to God,
I'm burning this to the ground.

154
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,553
What's interesting is that the strikers 
and our Marxist in a box are casting a 

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,660
pretty sympathetic light.
Sure.

156
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,670
Jeff Bezos has this to say about Josh.

157
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,853
See how the box ridiculous commercialism
in order to try and feel better about 

158
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,040
itself,

159
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,873
a sentiment of resentment echoed by the 
boys as they try to cancel the bike 

160
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:43,690
grade to obscure their own failure.
We're never going to win the bike ride,

161
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,060
but if we get a canceled,
then everybody loses.

162
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,150
But as what the rest of the season,
the message seems to be resignation.

163
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,283
Strikers are encouraged to cross picket 
lines to appease their materialistic 

164
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,760
children.
Others kids on bikes,

165
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:56,420
and maybe

166
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,940
you won't get off your ass and work.
Dad

167
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,260
and Josh gets ripped open by a mob of 
gift hungry kids.

168
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,330
Jeff Bezos,
as Josh says,

169
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,510
it makes too many useful things 
resulting in too many useless people,

170
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,950
but it seems we can't resist.
You need your Amazon prime shows in your

171
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,784
music and your books and your things 
delivered to your door like little 

172
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:15,874
presents to yourself.
In true south park fashion are only 

173
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:22,000
savior is a fake one,
a fake claim to authenticity in the form

174
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,863
of integrity that ends up just being 
repackaged and sold by a huge online 

175
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,870
retailer.
Even though it's a functional Amazon,

176
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,810
we're reminded

177
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,040
you don't want to be elite because the 
elites gotten old integrity.

178
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,970
Even our anti consumers to send is just 
a regular part of the business cycle.

179
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,983
It's not that integrity save south park,
but the cynical interest of randy 

180
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,280
packets tegrity,
I got more money now because integrity,

181
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,090
that's because I figured out how to get 
tired.

182
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,440
Everyone was once supposed to be a 
counter.

183
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:54,710
Cultural rejection of modern life 
becomes a symbol for the commodification

184
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,630
of dissent.
The bike parade,

185
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:57,464
which was once a pond and Jeff Bezos,
the scheme to break the strike is now 

186
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:01,424
sponsored by tegrity.
We'd citywalk and Taco South Park to 

187
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,730
seems content to bask in cynical 
tegrity.

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,560
As the boys tried to cancel the bike 
parade,

189
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,453
it becomes clear that the parade is a 
metaphor for the show and its marketing 

190
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,170
campaign.
Hashtag cancer South Park,

191
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,093
we demand you canceled the bike parade.
It is an added touch with progressive 

192
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,274
day.

193
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,560
Everything out there is getting 
canceled,

194
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,690
but when it comes to us,
we just can't do it.

195
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,980
I mean,
are we supposed to just keep going?

196
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,970
Just go on making total assets of 
ourselves,

197
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,083
just that south park was promoting 
itself with a half serious critique of 

198
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:37,744
itself.
The show is content to continue basking 

199
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:40,474
in the business of selling television 
ads where they have serious critique of 

200
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,400
consumers.
Now,

201
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:46,840
if you really want to stick it to the 
man,

202
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,853
I recommend you try wicks.
There's no better way to discover the 

203
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:54,190
true joy of an alienated labor.
Then by designing your own website,

204
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,240
a specter is haunting your future,
the specter of not having a website,

205
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,150
so go to [inaudible] dot com slash wise.
Crack to sign up today.

206
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,670
The only thing you have to lose is your 
chains,

207
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,450
and as always nice.
