00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,390
This video is brought to you by wix.
Let's talk about Kanye West.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,420
The years 2009 at the MTV video music 
awards killer.

3
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:16,200
Swift wins an award over beyonce and you
might remember what happened next.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,370
I'll let you finish of the best videos 
of all time.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,010
Goes on to apologize and then apologize 
and it all gets very confusing.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,850
Fast forward to 2016 and Kanye track 
famous features.

7
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:30,590
This slide

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,310
appeal like me and Taylor,
my still as sex.

9
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:36,880
Why I made that famous,
I made that.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,600
It's famous.
The Internet got mad.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,673
Taylor swift got mad and then audio 
comes out that Taylor swift knew about 

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,320
and even encouraged the song from the 
start.

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,250
Me and Taylor might still have six.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,470
Yeah,
I mean,

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,250
and I really appreciate you telling me 
about it.

16
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,210
That's really nice.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,410
Wait,
what?

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,773
Well,
this seemingly insignificant example 

19
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:07,960
perfectly explained our current cultural
and political predicament and it all has

20
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:11,250
to do with a concept from professional 
wrestling called,

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,113
believe it or not,
if we pay attention to these guys will 

22
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,160
be able to better understand what's 
going on with these guys.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,473
If we're right,
it might be the case that wrestling 

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,180
truly can explain everything.
Welcome to the wide world of Kayfabe,

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,543
but before we get into it and want to 
give a shout out to our sponsor over at 

26
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:30,724
Wix,
if you've ever thought about creating 

27
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:32,554
your own website,
which will give you total creative 

28
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,690
freedom to make a professional and 
engaging website for any occasion,

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,763
we even whipped up a site using their 
cool community features so you guys can 

30
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,240
vote on what kind of content you want us
to make.

31
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,010
Next.
More on that at the end of the video,

32
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,750
but for now,
back to the show.

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,913
So what is it's a term used to describe 
the way in which professional wrestling 

34
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,414
consists of staged events and 
predetermined narratives that are 

35
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,834
treated as true.
So even though everyone knows that 

36
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,330
wrestling is scripted,
they still treat it like a real athletic

37
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,164
competition.
And even when wrestlers are off the 

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:04,864
clock and out of the ring,
they never acknowledged this as this 

39
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,990
would constitute the unholy sin known as
breaking Kayfabe.

40
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,210
You never break Kayfabe

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,780
the put this commitment to Kayfabe into 
perspective.

42
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:21,614
This would basically be like if Matt 
Damon refused to accept his drink at 

43
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,034
starbucks,
unless the Barista called out the name 

44
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:30,140
Jason Bourne.
Now wrestling fans aren't idiots.

45
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:30,974
They of course know that the fights are 
scripted and that the wrestlers are 

46
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,394
characters,
but it's not the truth of the events 

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,870
that matter.
It's the story.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,250
It's not true because it's real.
It's true because it's entertaining.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,330
It's still,
hey,

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,270
doesn't just apply to any reality show 
that may or may not be true.

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,680
You as this would make 90 percent of 
modern entertainment Kayfabe.

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,993
Instead,
Kayfabe refers who entertainment in 

53
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,244
which staged events are presented as 
real by those producing them and 

54
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:06,010
perceived as real by those consuming 
them.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,280
It's kind of like Santa Claus.
Everyone knows he's fake,

56
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,960
but because we're all in on it,

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,513
and this time we agree with you Dwayne,
and in case any kiddos are watching 

58
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:18,204
this,
don't be upset while Santa Claus is a 

59
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,390
lie,
so is God,

60
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:22,224
so remove the shackles from your tiny 
souls and dare to live a life beyond 

61
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,560
good and evil,
but much like John Cena,

62
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,483
Kayfabe didn't stick to just wrestling 
for long and in a manner reminiscent of 

63
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:34,590
Dwayne Johnson himself.
Hey,

64
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:38,580
faith has now infected the entire 
entertainment industry and as we'll soon

65
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:39,414
see our lives and while professional 
wrestling is unsurprisingly full of 

66
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,184
Floridians.
Another famous floridian has used 

67
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:49,470
Kayfabe in a seemingly unlikely medium 
rap music.

68
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,783
Rick Ross,
who is basically the Santa Claus of 

69
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:53,304
Miami,

70
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,320
goes on the phone with June.
The static DC coming,

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,630
has built a career on the narrative that
he's a legendary Boston,

72
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:06,631
the drug game comparing himself to 
enthuse kingpins and countless songs.

73
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,270
However,
pictures leaked,

74
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,104
which revealed that the boss with a 
belly full of Rosa spent his younger 

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,840
years as a corrections officer.
So rather than ducking the law,

76
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,763
Rick Ross was enforcing it.
Many assumed this would be the end of 

77
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,000
his career.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,270
How do you feel about Boston giving you 
an officer Reiki?

79
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,523
I just want to hear it from you.
Maybe I'm worth too much money to even 

80
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,180
be side tracked on his copy,
but

81
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,133
it had very little effect.
Ross responded with a fakeness that 

82
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:45,960
would make a French new wave fan proud 
about who rosa is.

83
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:46,794
This about me,
when anywhere I go and I step in the 

84
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:49,430
room,
I put it down.

85
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,070
People know this.
Authentic right here they know is real,

86
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:55,610
so this go get this money.
Let's make this music and his career has

87
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:56,444
only grown since Kayfabe can help us 
understand this as the fans prefer the 

88
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:01,484
narrative of Ross as a Miami drug 
kingpin over the truth of his career in 

89
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,900
law enforcement and why would Ross care 
what's true and what's not?

90
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,010
As long as he's selling records,
we can see another use of Kayfabe in the

91
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:13,844
world of Youtube.
Most infamous brothers Bill Paul in a 

92
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,160
move that would likely confused Rick 
Ross.

93
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,210
The two brothers often engage in a back 
and forth beef via youtube videos,

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,990
along with making Aaron Carter look 
hardcore by comparison.

95
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,403
Thirty four slash seven from this battle
can be best to analyze as a clever use 

96
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:37,244
of Kayfabe to gain the youtube algorithm
to get the brothers and more clicks and 

97
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,790
more dollars and just in case Rick Ross 
is watching this,

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,610
rick,
we will gladly send you a free,

99
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,444
wise crack Hoodie if you post your own 
rap video that shuts the Paul's up once 

100
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,030
and for all,
and for us did this.

101
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,923
It would make him a shooter,
which is a cafe term for someone who 

102
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,160
makes the and wrestling

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,510
real.
Before we go on.

104
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:03,200
It's worth noting how Kayfabe is also 
distinct from satire,

105
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,800
while for both the performer

106
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,663
and the audience are in on the joke.
Satire is used precisely to point us 

107
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:12,630
toward the absurdity of the actual truth
rather than create a new one.

108
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,200
For example,
Stephen Colbert engaged in satire on the

109
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,034
Colbert report.

110
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,080
I don't even see race,
not even my own.

111
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,423
People tell me I'm white and I believed 
them because I just devoted six minutes 

112
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,960
to explaining how I'm not a racist,

113
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,580
as his character was used to exemplify 
the absurdity of cable news.

114
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:31,414
Host Bill O'reilly,
but Info wars host Alex Jones can be 

115
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:36,220
better analyze via Kayfabe.

116
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm a pioneer.
I'm an explorer.

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm a human and I'm coming

118
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,300
is insane.
Claims are always presented in the guise

119
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,480
of political truth and the audience buys
into the narrative.

120
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,703
The cold air and O'reilly example can 
help us understand another set of terms 

121
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:53,274
used by Kayfabe faces and heals faces 
referred to the good guys in wrestling 

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,433
and heels are the bad guys,
and while we might outwardly route for 

123
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,424
the faces,
the heels are the ones who sell the 

124
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,064
tickets.
This can help explain the polarization 

125
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,150
of the media.
Heels are where the money is,

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,700
so o'reilly and Co had their heel and 
Obama.

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,693
What President Obama does not understand
is that he has lost all credibility in 

128
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:16,840
matters of security

129
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,430
and now the liberal media has found 
their ultimate heal in trump.

130
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,323
What he saying was not true.
Now you might be thinking that if 

131
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:26,820
Kayfabe only applies to the media,
then why should I care?

132
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,900
Well,
we think that Dwayne,

133
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,750
it absolutely does matter because the 
terrifying reality is that Kayfabe is an

134
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,140
even better tool for understanding 
contemporary politics.

135
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,360
Uh,
Twenty Sixteen New York Times article by

136
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,210
Jeremy Gordon was titled,
is everything wrestling,

137
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,360
which we might rephrase as is our world 
becoming one elaborate Kayfabe take Alex

138
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,983
Jones,
while he's known for his subtle 

139
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,140
political arguments,

140
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,440
destroy the corrupt them all.
This is their plan people.

141
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,030
These are demons

142
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,970
and stellar advertising campaigns for 
legit medical supplements.

143
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,600
Heat recently used to his defense in a 
court of law

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,680
attorney Randal willhite said Jones is 
playing a character on his radio show.

145
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,203
Just claim doesn't change the fact that 
his show is considered a new source by 

146
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,160
his millions of viewers.
And yes,

147
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,820
it can be fun to play with this persona.
I'm not a Democrat either.

148
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,910
I'm an idealist,
but the pizzagate scandal shows the dark

149
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,370
side of Jones.
His brand of political Kayfabe.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,833
Kayfabe isn't just being used for the 
type of fringe media being kicked off 

151
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:34,240
youtube.
It's all over TV news as well.

152
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,680
CNN has acknowledged that their primary 
aim is not objective news,

153
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,220
but rather entertainment.
According to a New York Times profile of

154
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,830
CNN,
President Jeff Zucker as Zucker sees it,

155
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,460
his pro trump panelists are not just 
spokespeople for a worldview.

156
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,520
They are characters in a drama.
Members of CNNS extended ensemble cast.

157
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,753
Michelle Wolf recently out how much 
cable news depends on heels and 

158
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,770
constructed narratives.

159
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,723
Watching the host act like the guest 
forced his way into the studio is so 

160
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,624
compelling,
you almost forget that he was invited 

161
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,834
on.

162
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,580
Finally,
the biggest example of political kayfabe

163
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,580
might be the 45th president of the 
United States,

164
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,970
Donald J dot trump.
No stranger to reality TV.

165
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,170
Trump is the first politician to fully 
embrace the power of Kayfabe.

166
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,620
Trump has made a number of claims that 
are clearly untrue.

167
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,700
I know more about isis than the generals
do.

168
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:30,534
Believe me.
This was the largest audience to ever 

169
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,174
witness an inauguration period,
and of course his threats against his 

170
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,650
old trend,
Hillary Clinton.

171
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,633
It's just awfully good that someone with
the temperament of Donald trump is not 

172
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:46,170
in charge of the law in our country 
because you'd be in jail.

173
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,100
How does much truth behind them as the 
beef between stone cold and the rock,

174
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,530
but just like Rick Ross,
his criminal past.

175
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,723
It's the narrative that matters.
Not the facts from maybe especially 

176
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,704
extreme in his political Kayfabe,
but politicians across the spectrum use 

177
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:02,904
it just as much.
While the Democrats have been vocal in 

178
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,110
their support for fighting against 
climate change.

179
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,973
The DNC is also recently backtracked on.
They're banned from taking donations 

180
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:11,724
from the fossil fuel lobby,
but of course this won't stop their 

181
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,250
narrative of being the party of 
environmentalism.

182
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,383
So why is Kayfabe having a moment?
The most obvious answer is that it 

183
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:22,824
allows people to ground reality in 
narrative rather than empirical truth 

184
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,690
and who wouldn't want to leave,
and an exciting story full of heroes and

185
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,533
villains and escalating drama.
As Jeremy Gordon said in the New York 

186
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,720
Times.
If a story is well told,

187
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,870
if it's history seems consistent than 
the machinations,

188
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:44,190
putting it into place can be temporarily
overlooked or turned into a fun story of

189
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,500
their own and why not?

190
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,693
In the end,
we're all marks for a world we want to 

191
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:50,994
believe it,
and this brings us to our last Kayfabe 

192
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:55,110
vocab term of the day,
mark,

193
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,810
which is a fan who was so excited to 
believe,

194
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:58,644
a narrative that they lose sight of it's
fictional nature and treat it as real 

195
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,440
for the mark.
It's not about what is true,

196
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,423
it's about what they want to be true,
and this might be the danger of Kayfabe 

197
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,433
when it turns from a principle of 
entertainment into a practical 

198
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:13,944
philosophy writer.
Nick Rogers had this to say in the New 

199
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,573
York Times.
Kathy isn't merely a suspension of 

200
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,710
disbelief.
It his philosophy about truth itself.

201
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,693
It rests on the assumption that feelings
are inherently more trustworthy than 

202
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,610
facts.
Hey,

203
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,453
Babes.
Philosophy replaces reason and 

204
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,710
objectivity in the favor of emotion and 
opinion,

205
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,023
and the most dangerous part of this 
world of cafe is that we might not even 

206
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,930
realize that we are in fact marks of our
own creation.
