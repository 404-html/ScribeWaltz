1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,223
I think the most famous piece of writing
advice that there is is right what you 

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,360
know,
and I think it's honestly,

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:08,490
I think it's the best piece of advice 
there is,

4
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:11,280
but I think it is the most 
misunderstood,

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:15,870
most mistaught,
most misinterpreted piece of advice that

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,450
there is.
It's so simple and so obvious.

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,970
And I used to terrify me this idea of 
write what you know,

8
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,280
I was dreaming.
I was in Suburbia,

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,630
you know,
in my house,

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,580
dreaming of being a writer and I 
thought,

11
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,260
what am I going to do with.
Right?

12
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,094
What,
you know,

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,800
what I know from childhood is I was on 
the couch watching TV,

14
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:35,580
so I should simply rewrite a whole 
series of sitcoms for you.

15
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:38,130
I should write a book called what's 
happening and then I should write a book

16
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,230
called Little House on the prairies on 
at 5:00.

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:40,830
You know what I'm saying?

18
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,663
This is,
that was my childhood experience and 

19
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,914
this didn't feel to me when I thought of
the books that I love and that kind of 

20
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,304
stuff I wanted to write.
It felt like I am going to be very 

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,610
limited by.
Right.

22
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,370
What I know,
you know,

23
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,790
this idea like,
oh my family history,

24
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,480
we don't,
you know,

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm very American.
I don't know my family history.

26
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,280
That's something that I,
it,

27
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,114
you know,
in the new book I wrote a story about 

28
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,780
that very idea,
but I don't know,

29
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,280
my family history.
And,

30
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:06,240
and to me as a kid out in suburbia,
that wasn't the most thrilling life,

31
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:07,074
you know,
that's part of the central part of 

32
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,310
growing up for those of us who were like
disenfranchised suburban kids,

33
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:15,210
was wanting to leave that town or that 
world or that house,

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,440
you know,
I love you mom.

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,970
But nonetheless,
you know,

36
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,280
like so,
so for me,

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,360
when I thought about right,
where,

38
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,400
you know,
when I really thought about it,

39
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,140
understood like what it is is empathic 
advice.

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,120
It's advice about feeling,
you know,

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,480
most of the books that we truly love 
don't exist because these things did not

42
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,980
happen to the people that were writing 
them.

43
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,200
But why do we love those books?
Why do they change this?

44
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,240
Why do they touch our hearts?
Why do they hold so much meaning?

45
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,223
Because they are truer than truth.
Because there is a great knowing within 

46
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,250
them and I think what's behind,
right?

47
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:45,000
What you know is emotion.
Like have you known happiness?

48
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,900
Have you ever been truly sad?
Have you ever longed for something?

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,853
And that's the point is if you've longed
for an Atari Twenty 600 as I did when I 

50
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,660
was 12,
you know,

51
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,630
like all I wanted was that game console.
Know what I'm saying?

52
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:58,464
If you have felt that deep longing,
that can also be a deep longing for a 

53
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:05,710
lost love or for liberation of your 
country or to,

54
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,380
you know,
reach Mars,

55
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,131
you know,
that's the idea.

56
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:11,250
If you've known longing than you can 
write longing.

57
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,330
And that's,
you know,

58
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,950
that is the knowing behind,
right?

59
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:14,784
What,
you know.
