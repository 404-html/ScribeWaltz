00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,110
This video is brought to you by skill 
share.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,980
What's up wise?
Crack Jared again.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,963
Now you would think that after almost 20
years of some of the most intense fan 

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,620
hatred ever,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,650
thumbs way down,
you didn't like,

6
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:17,484
no,
I think I deserve a public apology from 

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,080
George Lucas.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,080
There'd be nothing new to say about the 
worst star war,

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,290
the phantom menace.
And yet here we are.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,363
After the release of return of the Jedi.
In 1983 millions of fans begged George 

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,870
Lucas to create a new star wars film.
Studio executives begged him,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,853
toy makers,
begged him and after constantly saying 

13
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:42,010
no.
Finally in 1999 everyone got their wish.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,440
George Lucas released the phantom 
menace.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,580
Problem solved except not really upon 
release.

16
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,414
Star Wars fans rose up in fury and 
demanded the head of George Lucas on a 

17
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,050
tuscan spike.
They rallied together and aol chat rooms

18
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:56,884
and Yahoo message boards.
And for the first time in these short 

19
00:00:58,871 --> 00:00:59,704
history of the Internet,
fans from across the world banded 

20
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:02,584
together in the righteous cause of 
tearing George Lucas a new one for the 

21
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,930
unforgivable sin that was making this 
movie.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,880
And hey look,
they had a point.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,220
The phantom menace,
for lack of better word,

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,143
sucks.

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,223
Hundreds of articles,
essays and videos have been written 

26
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,390
about how it sucks shadow Mr Plink it.
So you don't mind.

27
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:20,224
I like the characters.
Know what you're stupid and why it 

28
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:24,424
sucks.
So much so that it has become a given 

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,920
that there's absolutely nothing 
redeemable about this movie.

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,520
But what if that's not entirely true?
Relax.

31
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm not going to argue that many 
chlorines were a great idea.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,553
It is possible he was conceived.
Instead of want to talk about what the 

33
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:45,220
phantom menace gets almost right.
Because conceptually there are some very

34
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:48,670
promising themes at play here.
Namely Nazis.

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,803
It's no secret that the original trilogy
largely wanted you to conflate the 

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,283
empire with the third,
right from the costumes to the use of 

37
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,494
color.
And of course naming the soldiers storm 

38
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,164
troopers.
But how did the galaxy get to be this 

39
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,220
way?
Like Nazi Germany,

40
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:06,760
which descended into totalitarianism 
through democratic means,

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,773
George Lucas aspired to portray 
something immensely important with the 

42
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:11,740
prequels.

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,573
How a peaceful republic can 
democratically descend into full blown 

44
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,640
nazi-ism.
So what went wrong?

45
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,810
Well,
let's find out.

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,270
Welcome to this wisecrack condition on 
star wars.

47
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,130
Episode one,
the Phantom Menace.

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,920
What went wrong?
And uh,

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,440
can you spoil the movie with no plot?
Oh,

50
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,770
and if you want to hear us nerd out 
about the Disney star wars backlash,

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,370
check out our special episode on our 
movie podcast.

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,213
Show me the meaning.
You will smash that link in the 

53
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,470
description for everyone who hasn't seen
this in over a decade.

54
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,304
Here's a brief recap and organization 
called the Trade Federation is 

55
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:48,900
protesting trade taxes by blockading 
trade with the planet and the Boob.

56
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,063
But I guess it doesn't have to make 
sense because really they're doing it 

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,880
all for their boy.
Darth Sidious,

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,450
Aka Senator Palpatine.
There are public,

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,740
a certain quiet gone gin and his 
apprentice.

60
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,520
Oh,
we Kenobi to negotiate,

61
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,770
but the trade federation tries to kill 
them.

62
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,903
They flee to the surface of Nibu,
which is now being invaded by the trade 

63
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,534
federation and counter the worst 
character ever conceived in cinematic 

64
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,774
history.
Save the Queen and try to zoom off to 

65
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,494
the Galactic Senate where they can 
explain what a bunch of jerks the trade 

66
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,764
federation is.
But they get shot up and at the find 

67
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,494
supplies on tattooing where they meet a 
nice slave boy with incredible force 

68
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,020
blood.
There are some like gambling.

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,913
They liberate the boy,
leave his mother to rot and head to the 

70
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,034
Senate to plead their case.
There's a battle quite gone dies or we 

71
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,850
won murders.
Darth Maul and Palpatine is now the head

72
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,590
Honcho of the Galactic Senate.
Also,

73
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:43,420
jar jar is a general,
the original trilogy,

74
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,254
while wonderfully enjoyable are not 
complex works of emotional art and 

75
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,874
they're not intended to be.
There are updates of the flash gordon 

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,590
buck Rogers cereals from Lucas's 
childhood.

77
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,520
The heroes were good men who often were 
white and the villains were evil men who

78
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,060
often wore black just like luke 
skywalker and darth vader.

79
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,390
There's no ambiguity here and that's 
okay.

80
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,050
The phantom menace on the other hand is 
quite ambiguous,

81
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,063
quite gone,
lies in cheats his way through most of 

82
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,840
the story.
He as per the light side of the forest,

83
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,793
quietly meditates before his final 
confrontation against Darth Maul and 

84
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,770
gets wrecked.

85
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,720
Obiwan fills with rage and emotion 
associated with the dark side.

86
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,330
And only then can he effectively avenge 
his master,

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
not quite the black and white morality 
of the first three films,

88
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,500
but most notable is our benevolent 
heroin Queen Ahmed Dolla.

89
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,860
She spends the phantom menace trying to 
save her people,

90
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,813
but for all her noble intentions,
she mostly gets manipulated by senator 

91
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:47,020
palpatine and even proves integral in 
getting him elected supreme chancellor.

92
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,093
When good leads to victory for evil,
we've entered the realm of the morally 

93
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,384
ambiguous in his essay art and moral 
education philosopher Christopher 

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,273
Hamilton expounds on the richness of 
such moral ambiguity in so much as they 

95
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,890
force us to confront our own moral 
beliefs.

96
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,843
It's a sign of great art.
So did the phantom menace give us that 

97
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,630
gut punch that comes with us 
reevaluating our own moral beliefs?

98
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,850
Of course it did.
Right,

99
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,650
right.
Okay.

100
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,483
Just kidding.
I felt nothing all 20 times I've seen 

101
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,824
this movie.
Ambiguity is a great idea when dealing 

102
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:22,630
with complex issues like political 
systems,

103
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,920
trade federation,
planetary autonomy,

104
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,450
solving humanitarian crises.
So why didn't it work?

105
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,590
Because the characters have no agency.
Author.

106
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,424
Chuck Wendig,
who has written extensively on the 

107
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,734
subject defines agency and fiction as a 
demonstration of the characters ability 

108
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:44,521
to make decisions and affect the story.
They have motivations all their own.

109
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,380
They are active more than they are 
reactive.

110
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,090
They push the plot more than the plot 
pushes on them and contrast.

111
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,924
He writes that characters without agency
tend to be like little paper boats 

112
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,030
bobbing down a river of your own making.
They cannot steer.

113
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,010
They cannot change the course of the 
river.

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,040
The river is an external force that 
carries them along,

115
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,083
meaning the plastics,
his hand up the characters cavernous 

116
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:07,904
bottom hole and makes the character do 
things and say things in service to the 

117
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,130
plot in the phantom menace.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,993
It's almost like Lucas took this rule of
bad writing and ran with it quite gone 

119
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,290
and Anagen and Pat May and Obi wan and 
God helped me judge.

120
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,410
Our banks aren't nothing but little 
paper boats.

121
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,710
They have no internal conflict,
no external life,

122
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,360
no personal obsession outside of what 
the film dictates and that river pushing

123
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,320
them along.
And I'll,

124
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,480
as we later learn,
it's the dark side.

125
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,613
It does everything possible to see the 
future and the biggest casualty besides 

126
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:50,480
the time you and I just wasted being 
bored is the political message itself.

127
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,260
The best example of this is the story of
Queen Amidala Pad May,

128
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:58,130
along with many of the other characters 
are mere ponds of palpatine.

129
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,400
That's not necessarily a bad thing,
but as we'll see,

130
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,323
palpatine's manipulations quickly turned
into how to cover up bad writing one on 

131
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,130
one.
Here's what we know about pat mate.

132
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,070
She's a queen who doesn't want to submit
to some invader because,

133
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,360
well,
that's what Queens do.

134
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,570
Just a likes democracy because hey,
she's not evil.

135
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,703
So in Star Wars,
how does a queen who likes democracy 

136
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,290
lead to the eventual downfall of said 
democracy?

137
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,340
She gets manipulated.
Palpatine creates a crisis on the Bu,

138
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,480
which mirrors the prototypical false 
flag attack of the Reichstag fire.

139
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,880
And she has to plead to the Senate to 
intervene.

140
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,163
But palpatine's since he's smart,
knows their feckless bureaucrats and 

141
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,090
will do nothing.
He plants a seed in dollars.

142
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,650
Mind,

143
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,050
I must be frank.
I mean,

144
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,940
I just hate that isn't it'll chance to 
send it to will act on the Indonesian.

145
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,910
She sees his warning come true.

146
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,953
This is Brad Thompson.
Pint is conceited when you defer your 

147
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:59,620
motion to allow a commission to explore 
the validity of your accusations

148
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,150
calls for the supreme chancellor to be 
ousted

149
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,390
and is the village of no confidence and 
child suffer Lauren's leadership

150
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,413
so that a real statesman can take charge
and cut through the bureaucratic red 

151
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:11,224
tape that real estate's been just 
happens to be our ambitious senator and 

152
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,560
future Emperor Xiv.
Palpatine Aka darth sidious.

153
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,050
Here's where our paper boats become a 
problem.

154
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,290
Characters without agency are well 
boring.

155
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,153
But in this case of trying to get into 
the complexity of not only how 

156
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,874
democracy's fail,
but how well meaning people are 

157
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:30,814
implicated,
paper wrote characters rob us of our 

158
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,990
ability to reflect on what's actually 
happening.

159
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,450
Beat for beat.
It makes sense.

160
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,750
Palpatine warrants or of something.
She sees his warning come true,

161
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,810
so she falls for the deception and even 
sounds good,

162
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,320
but maybe because Lucas was too busy 
cramming in 8,000

163
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,990
dumb lines for this guy,
it falls flat.

164
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,393
Each beat could have confronted our 
character with a choice they might 

165
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:57,690
deliberate over with or at least talk 
about this choice.

166
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,930
She might argue with Palpatine,
she might confide in a friend,

167
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,240
she might reach out to an outside 
government for help.

168
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,470
She might deny palpatine's bargain at 
all costs and Toba toll on her citizenry

169
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,930
gets too high,
but in the phantom menace,

170
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,740
things just kind of happen because 
everyone is a pawn,

171
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,843
not a person with agency,
and that destroys our ability as the 

172
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,894
audience to reflect on these issues.
When we identify with the characters we 

173
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,290
identify would their dilemma asking 
ourselves,

174
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,273
what would I do when in the dark knight,
the joker rigs to boats with explosives 

175
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:30,774
to give each one the power to obliterate
the other before they get obliterated 

176
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,194
themselves.

177
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,410
Midnight,
I blow you all alone,

178
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,730
however,
presses the button.

179
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,010
I'll let that though.

180
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,703
We bite our nails as we debate the 
merits of killing someone else to save 

181
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:46,454
our own skin.
There's no such tension in the phantom 

182
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:51,710
menace because pat may is just 
palpatine's puppet.

183
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,750
And what's the deal with the other 
senators?

184
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,120
What are their motivations?
Who knows?

185
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,330
We're just hold when and how they side 
with palpatine.

186
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,493
And to make matters worse,
at no point does pad may regret the 

187
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:03,824
decision that would eventually destroyed
democracy in the phantom menace or in 

188
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:07,544
the later movies.
If her initial decision to remove the 

189
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:13,550
supreme chancellor from power gives us 
no room to empathize and think.

190
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,340
At least we can empathize and think 
about her regret.

191
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,370
But no for a woman who later says this,

192
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,270
so this is how it appears.
He dies and their supplies,

193
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,343
you might at least expect her to sob 
quietly in some corner because she 

194
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,290
literally made this happen.
By contrast,

195
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,360
consider Jamie lannister from game of 
thrones.

196
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,373
He was a loyal guard to the mad king.
Zapped when the mad king tried to 

197
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:42,321
incinerate all of his citizens.
Jamie broke his sacred oath and murdered

198
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,250
the person he swore to protect.

199
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Then the king drove my soldiers back.

200
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,933
Jamie is haunted by this decision as 
he's derisively called Kinsler for the 

201
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,840
rest of his life and while he probably 
made the right choice,

202
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,760
he's also acutely aware that he is more 
or less responsible for the current show

203
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,594
in Westeros.
He takes responsibility for the choices 

204
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:06,804
he made and that allows us to identify 
with him or we can even look at rogue 

205
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:15,360
one where a good characters involvement 
in the creation of the death star is put

206
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,194
front and center.
Not only does this lack of agency rob 

207
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,450
meaning from the how democracy dies 
theme in the phantom menace,

208
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,070
but it also makes all of Lucas's topical
and timely takes on news of the decade,

209
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:26,904
more or less meaningless.
The phantom menace came out in the late 

210
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,973
nineties just years after governments in
Bosnia and Rwanda had committed 

211
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,600
genocide.
So when the queen of Nobu is pleading to

212
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:40,020
an international,
I mean interplanetary government body to

213
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,910
intervene in the slaughter for people.

214
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,960
George Lucas inspiration was pretty 
obvious on a narrative level.

215
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,794
Do we care?
Not really vague shout outs to current 

216
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,570
events.
Don't a good political allegory make you

217
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,550
need choices.
Instead,

218
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:58,540
we understand it as just another step in
Palpatine's greater machinations.

219
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,493
When the Senate fails to do anything,
we don't understand their motivations 

220
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:03,184
for doing so or their personal failings 
aside from a line or two from palpatine 

221
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,354
describing them as an effectual.
And then there's the trade federation 

222
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,863
talk of taxes and trade in the opening 
crawl was likely meant to invoke 

223
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,330
contemporary debates about globalization
and free trade,

224
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,283
right on the heels of Nafta,
which was passed in 1994 and anti 

225
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,680
globalization protests.
So what does the Trade Federation want?

226
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,350
Why did the Senate passed taxes on 
trade?

227
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,543
Who The f knows?
It's also worth noting that aside from 

228
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,694
the political themes,
characters getting pushed along the 

229
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,900
narrative stream with no choice is 
everywhere.

230
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,943
In the case of George,
our heat literally succeeds via 

231
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:38,764
incompetence in the battle of Nobu,
his fumbling and carelessness 

232
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,030
accidentally release whatever these are,
which destroy a bunch of enemy droids.

233
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,910
I think this must be what business 
people mean by failing up.

234
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,640
And then there's Anagen who pushes a 
bunch of wrong buttons,

235
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:52,474
which very him to the droid ship where 
he can press a few more buttons to save 

236
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,070
the day.

237
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,903
Yeah.

238
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,053
What if this is the real curse of the 
phantom menace because it could have 

239
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,430
been a powerful movie.
More importantly,

240
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:09,180
it could have been a powerful children's
movie and join the likes of Harry Potter

241
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:12,720
as kid fictions covering horrific 
political history,

242
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,510
but it's not,
not even close.

243
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,493
Just mark it down as another example of 
grandiose ambitions ending and a face 

244
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,020
plant.
Indeed,

245
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:22,854
there are few things more painful than 
missing the mark on projects you pour 

246
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,540
your life and soul into.
I would know.

247
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,540
So before you dive head first into your 
next endeavor,

248
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,900
you're going to want to make sure you're
