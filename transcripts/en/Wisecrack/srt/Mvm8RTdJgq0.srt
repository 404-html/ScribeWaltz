1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,190
Hey guys,
jared again.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,800
Today we're talking about your favorite 
ocelot enthusiasts.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,150
Mallory Archer and his crew of snarky 
foul mouth spies,

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,490
Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,563
Archer is sustained.
Eight seasons worth of comedy would be 

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,880
occasional drastic reboot.
So what we form a cartel,

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,880
how hard could it be?
So what makes archer work?

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,863
What's its secret sauce?
How does watching it feel like a 

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,390
familiar experience?
Even as the show takes absurd leaps that

10
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:34,890
would probably kill off any other show.
Archer succeeds by inverting rules,

11
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:35,724
characters and narrative tropes of the 
spies genre while using sound and 

12
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:39,834
language gags to build a unique arsenal 
of humor that explores deeper 

13
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,190
character's psychology.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Oh,
it's Mrs J.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,180
Welcome

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,970
this wise crack addition on archer,
and as always spoilers ahead,

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,043
it should be no surprise that archer 
borrows plenty of the magic elements 

18
00:00:58,751 --> 00:00:59,584
from James Bond and slash or hello,
but these gags are more than just a 

19
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:06,280
shallow nod to double o seven bond films
regularly pit.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,280
The freewheeling titular stood against 
these stuffy,

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,220
boring rule makers best exemplified by 
him.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,263
To understand why this is important,
we have to look at what was going on in 

23
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:18,970
America during the meteoric rise of the 
James Bond series.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,980
According to sociologists,
Thomas Andre,

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,360
this time period was a crisis of 
masculinity in which the male desire for

26
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,194
autonomy and independence was displaced 
by pressure to sell out for a desk job 

27
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,934
with a 401k,
leaving many a man feeling like an 

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,030
alienated but conforming employee of a 
large corporate bureaucracy.

29
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,043
Spy Thrillers emerged as the perfect 
form of escapism with the character of 

30
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:41,974
James Bond,
exemplifying the ideals of independence 

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,763
agency and individualism that were 
otherwise the lacking in the day to day 

32
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,630
life of most American men.
Bonds,

33
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,464
characterization as a chronic 
rulebreaker who relied on his charisma 

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,280
and sheer guts to succeed made him the 
perfect hero for the time.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,230
Unfortunately,
be bond style.

36
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:02,260
Secret agent is a complete fiction.
Reportedly.

37
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:06,340
After viewing a James Bond film,
CIA officers would ask questions like,

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,330
why wasn't bond required to prepare an 
expense report throughout the series?

39
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,164
Archer takes this question and milks the
humor of the unglamorous espionage 

40
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,060
bureaucracy.
For all it's worth.

41
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Forgot the balance in my God damn cow 
date of employment or

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,600
mindless paperwork occupies a central 
role on the show.

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,020
Frequently threatening archers ability 
to live his best spy life.

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,160
You turned in an expense report from 
Berlin with the German desk,

45
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:39,940
says you've never checked in Berlin.
Too busy to chose.

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,720
Yeah,

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,553
the show contrast the fantastical action
sequences with the Monday and ease of 

48
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,770
office life to amazing comic effect

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,280
beneficiary on my company life 
insurance.

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,403
Even when archer does escape the 
bureaucratic ramifications of his 

51
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:58,640
actions,
it's only because of his boss,

52
00:02:58,641 --> 00:02:59,474
mom mallory's forgiveness.
Later in the series when the agency 

53
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,674
becomes a private investigation firm,
Cyril is the only one eligible for a Pi 

54
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,420
license.
As a result,

55
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,860
archer has to suffer the indignity of 
working for the figures agency.

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,920
While a character like Cyril prospers in
the world of espionage,

57
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,160
bureaucracy,
archers,

58
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:19,090
swashbuckling,
antics are usually counterproductive.

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,930
I don't see what could possibly go wrong
and a quick note on Cyril,

60
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,883
whereas some might associate paper 
pushers like him with emasculated 

61
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,500
stooges.
Cyril is instead addicted to sex.

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,820
Hello?
Hello,

63
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,950
hello.
And hypersexualized.

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,390
I think I need a spanking.
Archers.

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,800
The ultimate James Bond parody,
it's all about machismo,

66
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,110
exemplifying the qualities he's best 
known for,

67
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:41,944
and then taking them to their logical 
unromantic conclusion like bond archer 

68
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:50,380
is wild and untamed,
using drinking,

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,440
fighting womanizing cars,
and guns to affirm his manliness.

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,433
You want to see who's a big boy grow up.
The decades bond films have fetishize 

71
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,530
the latest,
sexiest car.

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,393
Aston Martin sponsored 12 of the 24 bond
movies usually offering promotional 

73
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,570
deals to let fan boys live out their 
dream of buying a bond car.

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,493
On the other hand,
archers car is a birthday gift from his 

75
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,524
mother,
presented to him as if it's his super 

76
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,670
sweet 16.
Oh my God.

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,733
Adding to the adolescent field,
the car gives archer and embarrassing 

78
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,770
erection.
Oh God.

79
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:27,604
He's got an erection.
The show mocks the way that bonds 

80
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:31,684
hypermasculinity was and still is used 
to sell products like cars and beer to 

81
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,640
men who want to embody the same 
qualities,

82
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,730
challenges,
special agent addition brought to you by

83
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,310
dodge,
dodge,

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,153
then go for the best of times.
Archers car may be a marker of his 

85
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,664
manliness,
but it's one that's on loan from Mommy 

86
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,450
who confiscates it.
Days later,

87
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,270
again,
be supposed masculine power of archer is

88
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:59,680
yanked away by his more powerful mother.
James Bond is one of cinemas,

89
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,840
most famous eductors.
Similarly,

90
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,200
archer is hypersexual,
constantly hiring sex workers,

91
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,130
sleeping with every office.
Mate.

92
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:09,964
Would you please come in this dirty 
toilet stall and have sex with me and 

93
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,790
propositioning every woman with a 
beating pulse and some without.

94
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,660
Could you close your eyes?

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,110
I kind of feel like I'm banging tail 
lights on a country road.

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,050
Of course,
while bond sexual prowess is legendary,

97
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,330
archers is less than that.
Oh,

98
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,630
you finished.
All right.

99
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,330
Maybe try.
Well,

100
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,700
I weights by the way,
makes one of us,

101
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,270
and while bond sex life come seemingly 
without physical consequences.

102
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,500
Archer frequently comes down with stds 
and has to pay for abortions.

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,620
Oh,
pay for other health effects of the bond

104
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:45,460
in lifestyle are also taken to a logical
extreme.

105
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,250
Wild James Bond is known to enjoy his 
liquor.

106
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,860
Archers.
Substance use is super human.

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,590
At one point,
he literally chugged germicide.

108
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,483
His drinking appears to play at least 
some role in him getting these Feminine 

109
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,640
Disease of Breast Cancer and a history 
of alcoholism,

110
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,500
you know,
I mean,

111
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,800
I drink socially,
but

112
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,423
I didn't have breakfast,
hardly the stuff of a double o playboy 

113
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,083
before archer undergoes chemo.
He has some of his sperm frozen later 

114
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:13,684
on.
Lot of secretly uses that sperm to 

115
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:15,934
become pregnant and have his baby 
without his permission or even his 

116
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:24,031
knowledge for the oblivious archer.
Even becoming a father somehow plays out

117
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,084
as a twisted form of emasculation cancer
isn't the only health ramifications of 

118
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,184
archer secret agent lifestyle.
There's also tonight is a hearing loss 

119
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,710
caused by too many damn guns going off 
all the time.

120
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,040
Either James Bond is always wearing 
earplugs or his craters.

121
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,710
Ignore the pesky realities of inner ear 
damage.

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,633
At one point,
archer and his crew even solidify 

123
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:44,864
tonight,
us as the show's pet cause attending an 

124
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:49,570
annual fundraiser for the American 
Tinnitus Association.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,553
Once again,
archer subverts the bulletproof James 

126
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,253
Bond and fantasy by dragging archer into
the bleakest realities of his mortal 

127
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,010
body.

128
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,790
But is there something more to archers?
Hearing loss communication scholar.

129
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,220
Ian,
I think so in his essay,

130
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,083
archer,
a spy parody for the ears dot argues 

131
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,770
that archers tonight is is more than an 
ongoing gag.

132
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,813
It's actually an important aspect of the
show's preoccupation with sound and 

133
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:13,654
language which are both used to generate
laughs and to provide deeper insights 

134
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:17,944
into character psychology to prove this 
doc conducted a study in which he 

135
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:23,710
watched every episode of archers,
third and fourth seasons,

136
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,603
and counted the number of linguistic or 
sound specific references including 

137
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:28,564
language jokes like puns,
foreign language references or loud 

138
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,610
gunfire followed by the high pitched 
ringing of archers.

139
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:38,350
Tinnitus dot found that such references 
occurred on average 10 times per episode

140
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,870
in the third season and 11 times in the 
fourth,

141
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,970
which comes out to approximately once 
every two minutes just as mundane office

142
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:49,870
politics serve as a humorous contrast to
the life threatening action sequences.

143
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,763
The show's language jokes are often 
employed at the most inopportune 

144
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:54,544
moments.
Don't take special interest in one of 

145
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,260
the shows.
Simplest ongoing gags.

146
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,220
Bada Bada

147
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,723
archers.
Frequent act of calling out loudly to 

148
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,190
Elana even when she is nearby is more 
than just a simple annoyance.

149
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,860
It's reminiscent of a baby calling out 
for its mother,

150
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,700
which for Archer probably never quite 
gave him the comfort he needed.

151
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,470
I don't feel good.
What the hell?

152
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,113
Essentially archers increasingly louder 
appeals to signal his inability to 

153
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:28,254
control his demand for attention.
Eventually other characters adopt the 

154
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:33,380
same gag.
Pam,

155
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,740
based on the growing frequency of these 
appeals for attention,

156
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,700
Nga says clearly it is very important in
this show for characters to be heard.

157
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,653
However,
it also seems to be important that they 

158
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,520
not be hurt too quickly by the listener 
bringing up the rooms of power,

159
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,520
demand control,
and psychological repression.

160
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,050
For instance,
take archers,

161
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,560
classic phrasing,
joke.

162
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,640
Don't you want to freshen up after your 
long ride raising mother?

163
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,780
This is a classic use of what Freud 
called Double Entendre in which the joke

164
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,240
depends quite specially on the sexual 
meaning,

165
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,950
even though the words have an 
alternative,

166
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:08,784
nonsexual meaning.
Freud thought that these sorts of jokes 

167
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:14,760
were way to release some of the nervous 
energy that comes from repressing sexual

168
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,594
or aggressive desires.
That's particularly significant when 

169
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:18,864
archers aiming the joke at his mother 
for whom he has more than an inkling of 

170
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:27,081
an oedipal complex clone of me,
dead gives you know just half of one,

171
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,480
but beyond that,
when archer says phrasing,

172
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,343
he's essentially choosing to 
miscommunicate and willfully 

173
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,370
misinterpreting the speaker's words.

174
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,233
Thus derailing the conversation by 
choosing to only hear the sexual 

175
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:39,864
innuendo.
Archer often ensures that the person 

176
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,310
won't be hurt at all.
I guess I'm a bad listener.

177
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,170
The tech,
they quickly becomes one of archers.

178
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,570
Favorite ways of hijacking a 
conversation.

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,583
As language tends to do phrasing spreads
as the other characters start adopting 

180
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,770
it.
Thank you for coming so quickly.

181
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
In fact,
the joke eventually become so ubiquitous

182
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:03,720
that it actually circles back and falls 
out of fashion like Yolo or on fleek.

183
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,703
Archers,
anxiety over the plummeting popularity 

184
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:06,984
of his favorite joke only confirms how 
important these attention grabbing 

185
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,734
antiques are to his identity.
The world's image of a perfect man 

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,213
reduced to a manchild phrasing isn't the
only way to avoid hearing what a 

187
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,700
character usually his mother is really 
saying.

188
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,683
Take the running gag about archers,
voicemail messages which become 

189
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:24,834
increasingly elaborate ruses to trick 
his mother into thinking she's actually 

190
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,190
speaking to him.

191
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,390
Sterling Sterling listened very 
voicemail as a result.

192
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,830
Mallory has entire conversations with is
prerecorded voice before realizing she's

193
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:38,664
been duped here.
Archer is taking great pleasure in the 

194
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,650
power he's able to wield in a 
conversation with his mother.

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,590
This voice message gag is archers 
hilarious.

196
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,513
If juvenile means of temporarily 
reclaiming some power momentarily 

197
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,400
undermining mallory's dominance over 
him.

198
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,090
I'm trying to just as archer has trouble
bending to the will of Isis.

199
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:01,314
As human resource department,
you often find themselves struggling 

200
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,840
with the rules of language.
I learned that flammable and inflammable

201
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,674
mean the same thing.
Both restraints prevent archer from 

202
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,660
living the bad ass spy narrative he 
envisions for himself.

203
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,210
One such example occurs in the three 
part series,

204
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,210
heart of archness.
When Archer has declared himself king of

205
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,044
the pirates,
he attempts to address his subjects 

206
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,520
through his translator slash slave noah.
Okay,

207
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,480
pirates.
Hey,

208
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,500
take a knee.

209
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,140
That won't translate.
It's like last week when you said,

210
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:30,030
lend me your ears,
and they were like,

211
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,770
damn it.
I can't do idiom.

212
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:33,690
Sorry.
Shut up.

213
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,660
Archer attempts to convey his message 
without these idioms,

214
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,970
but quickly finds it impossible.
Oh,

215
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,220
I never realized how much we rely on 
idiot.

216
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,073
You'll win this round here.
Archer shapes against the rules of 

217
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:47,760
language just like he chafes against the
rules of bureaucracy,

218
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,970
but even when he's not dealing with 
inconvenient language gaps,

219
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,240
archer still has trouble expressing 
himself.

220
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,640
No,
I still got that stemer.

221
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,180
While James Bond is well known for his 
pithy,

222
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,014
one liners.
Archer is not so gifted between his 

223
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,184
legs.
Frequently regretting his failure to 

224
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,120
come up with the perfect witty line.
Wait,

225
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,540
wait,
I got something for this.

226
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,220
Hush puppies.
Oh Damn.

227
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:13,300
That's better.
Again.

228
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,163
Archer parodies bond by turning his 
funny offhanded Innuendos into a chore 

229
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,000
in which Archer Still Comes up.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,110
Short operation,
something about I rescue,

231
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,510
Ilana,
and she begs me to take her back so then

232
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,000
you don't commit suicide.
Swear to God.

233
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,720
I had something at other times.
Archers language isolates him,

234
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,733
particularly when he's attempting to 
connect with others over his favorite 

235
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:35,884
obscure cultural references.
I would prefer not to Bartleby the 

236
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,740
scrivener.
Anybody?

237
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,230
Not a big Melville crowd here,
Huh?

238
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,940
While he's constantly grasping to be 
heard and to impress through his brain,

239
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:51,040
he call outs,
he rarely receives any affirmation.

240
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,933
Why am I William Sapphire?
It's always disappointing to have your 

241
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,534
thoughtful cultural references fall flat
and not even the greatest spy in this 

242
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,000
fictional cartoon land is immune to the 
shame.

243
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,893
Read a book,
archers chock full of fantastical fight 

244
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,954
sequences,
wildly ambitious spy missions and 

245
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,460
unnecessarily complicated weapons 
technology,

246
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,443
but much of the show's humor,
rest in the linguistic communications 

247
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,020
between the characters I honestly have 
no response to that is lingering.

248
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:17,854
Adolescent sense of being an outsider 
formed over and impressive 15 years 

249
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,114
spent at boarding school are perfectly 
expressed and his over enthusiasm for 

250
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,014
coining group slang and his wildly 
obscure pop culture references that 

251
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,360
inevitably fall flat.
Most of all,

252
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,223
archer embodies the perennial secret 
agent struggle born out of the 19 

253
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:35,944
fifties,
masculine anxiety about being cogs in 

254
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,300
the corporate machine,
but what do you guys think?

255
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,610
Will Sterling Archer ever learned to 
listen?

256
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,370
Will there ever be a joke?
Good enough to replace phrasing?

257
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,480
Let us know in the comments and as 
always,

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,600
thanks for watching guys.
Thanks for watching wise crack.
