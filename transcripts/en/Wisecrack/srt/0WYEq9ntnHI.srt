1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,480
The original impulse behind the book was
a recognition I've had.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,413
There are very many people who don't 
really enjoy what they do or perhaps in 

3
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,024
how they live.
They don't enjoy the work they do and 

4
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,080
they sort of tolerate it,
you know,

5
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,690
they got through the week and they wait 
for the weekend.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,280
Was a lot of evidence of that.
By that.

7
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:24,114
I love it.
Studies have shown that's massive 

8
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,944
disengagement at the workplace and yet I
also meet people who love what they do 

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,970
and they couldn't really imagine doing 
anything else.

10
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:33,804
If you said to them,
why don't you do something else for a 

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,140
change,
they really wouldn't know what you meant

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,060
to say,
but this isn't what I do.

13
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,290
It's it's who I am and they couldn't be 
veterinarians,

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,200
pathologists,
they could be dancers,

15
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,670
musicians,
they could be teachers,

16
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:48,960
homemakers,
you name it.

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,380
If you can think of a human activity or 
occupation,

18
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,050
there'll be people who love it and live 
for it and others who couldn't bear it.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,513
So I was just always intrigued by the 
difference between these two ways of 

20
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:00,504
being and the difference it makes.
I think it has really considered the 

21
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:05,704
implications.
It has implications that are social and 

22
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:10,280
character.
You know,

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,143
if we have communities where launch 
trenches of the population of simply 

24
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:16,644
detach this engaged and interested.
Of course it has big consequences if 

25
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,160
people are disengaged at work.
It has large consequences.

26
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:23,994
Now,
I'm not suggesting for a minute that if 

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,473
every finds that relevant,
it will solve every social problem we 

28
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:28,914
face,
but I'm certainly saying it would help 

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,103
and my longterm convictions always be in
that we all have the talents and the 

30
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,850
potential for engagement and we should 
explore it.

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,223
I have fallen into using the phrase the 
other climate crisis and I think it has 

32
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,794
a residence.
What I mean by it is that we've become 

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,430
used to the fact now at least I hope we 
have.

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,790
That is a crisis in the world's natural 
resources,

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,310
but I also think there is a crisis in 
our human resources and how we use them.

36
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,144
And one of the themes of the book is to 
make an analogy between the natural 

37
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,500
world and and the way our lives 
operating.

38
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,363
And we tend to think that we were 
persuaded ourselves because we live in 

39
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:14,541
cities like New York or la or wherever 
they were,

40
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,523
somehow independent of nature.
And of course we're not where organic 

41
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,430
creatures we live and we die and we,
uh,

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,060
we're subject to the own season,
the seasons of our own lives,

43
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,190
and just like the earth,
it seems to me,

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,910
human resources often buried deep 
beneath the surface.

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,863
You can spend your whole life completely
oblivious to some talent you may have 

46
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:38,160
because the opportunity never showed up 
for you to discover it or to develop it.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,533
So that's the broad aim of the book,
is to dig down more deeply into what it 

48
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,624
means to be in your element,
but also the book is really focused on 

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,970
providing some practical support,
health and exercises.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,133
Then if that's the journey that your 
interest in taking for yourself or for 

51
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,410
people who know and love your children 
or people you work with,

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,130
then I hope you'll stay

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,830
with us here on,
on big thing.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,733
Mentor.
