1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,850
A wise crack.
Jared here in the flesh this time,

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,043
you guys may or may not know this,
but why Scott conditions take a really 

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,134
long time and we've been wanting to do 
something where we can quickly react to 

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,580
what's currently on TV or in theaters.
So we,

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:18,480
because we try it out with season three 
of rick and morty and hey,

6
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,740
if you like this,
let us know.

7
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,020
We'd love to do these on things like 
game of thrones,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,510
stranger things,
wherever this Jake Paul Person Is,

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,493
you name it in Rick Man,
the stone we see rick summer and morty 

10
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,930
traversing a Mad Max inspired post 
apocalypse.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,913
What struck me most about this episode 
was an idea that has popped up in 

12
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:35,364
previous episodes but hasn't been as 
fleshed out as fan favorites like 

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,323
existences,
pain and everything you believe his 

14
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,070
bullshit scientifically traditions or an
idiot thing.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,310
That idea modern alienation through 
April,

16
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:47,580
right?

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,790
Glowing Rock,
a mustachioed murderer and Jerry,

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,143
the episode explores another depressing 
is guiding that society may be slowly 

19
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,454
destroying our soul.
Welcome to this wisecrack quick take on 

20
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,084
rick,
managing the stone and of course 

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,960
spoilers ahead,
but first a quick recap.

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,063
Rick Morty in summer infiltrate the 
aptly named death stalkers to steal a 

23
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:14,490
glowing rock that rick wants for science
40 and summer.

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,343
Use this aggressive world to vent all 
they're confused emotions about their 

25
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,804
parents' divorce.
Summer does all kinds of acting out and 

26
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,883
then falls for a swole dude with a 
bucket on his head and eventually goes 

27
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:27,060
through her own divorce.
There he is,

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,073
there's the nihilistic brute.
I married allowing her to contextualize 

29
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,780
her parents' separation,
morty fences,

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,623
frustration by living vicariously 
through a revenge driven arm and 

31
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,640
eventually realizes he should just let 
it go.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,593
Maybe the lesson we've learned is that 
whether it's our parents marriage 

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,980
glowing green rock or an awesome giant 
arm,

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,780
sooner or later you've got to let it go 
and rick acts like a child,

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,823
kind of my daughter's going through a 
divorce and I am not dealing with it in 

36
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,270
a healthy way at all.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,810
Early in the episode we hear Rick 
introduced the idea of alienation,

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
but if you're really that alienated,
I'm as willing to exploit it as the next

39
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:05,220
Guy Church army or Olympic gymnastics 
trainer suggesting that summer's tension

40
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,054
with Jerry has made her disillusioned 
and the only thing that can make her 

41
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,360
feel alive is to travel to a place where
civilization has crumbled.

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,493
Now the cover thing here is that the 
show not only tackles alienation on a 

43
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
micro level,
the family kind that summer and morty 

44
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,364
experience,
but on a macro level be alienation of 

45
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,274
society as a whole and through this,
the show frames how we lose agency in 

46
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,680
our everyday lives.
Hasten point,

47
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,573
Sherry,
I think this quote informs a lot of 

48
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,170
what's going on in this episode to live 
is to risk it off.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,033
Otherwise you're just in a NERC chunk of
randomly assembled molecules drifting 

50
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,940
wherever the universe blows you.
Oh,

51
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,310
I'm sorry Jerry,
I didn't see you there.

52
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,360
How much of that did you hear?
What rick is not so subtly suggesting is

53
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,570
Jerry's complete and utter lack of 
personal resolve,

54
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,820
power agency,
whatever you want to call it,

55
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,110
he's a doormat to the world.
This idea of powerlessness informs a lot

56
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:55,944
of mortise resentment towards Jerry as 
evidenced by this group standing in the 

57
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:05,350
driveway talking about custody and 
either Kelly or you want to stay married

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,540
or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

59
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,530
stop being a baby.

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,000
And this,
I think if dad really wanted to be here,

61
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,740
he'd stop at nothing to make that 
happen.

62
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,660
You know,
maybe dad just doesn't want you back.

63
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,730
Or maybe he just doesn't have the 
strength to fight.

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,890
And in either case,
he's got his life,

65
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,780
I got mine.

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,440
But mortise bitterness goes much further
than Jerry's failed marriage.

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,393
And that's because in some ways,
jerry is the every man of the modern 

68
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,084
world.
Since the days of the industrial 

69
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,004
revolution,
people have been complaining about loss 

70
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:37,470
of control in the modern world instead 
of having our own trade or farm,

71
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:42,210
many toil away at monotonous jobs.
This loss of autonomy is reflected on by

72
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,980
countless authors,
scholars,

73
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:44,814
and films.
But we might as well just throw this 

74
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:47,310
example at you.

75
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,630
See,
y'all need some attention.

76
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,630
Nice.
He's flown.

77
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,200
God dammit and entire generation pumping
gas waiting tables.

78
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,863
Slaves with white cops.
Advertising has is chasing cars and 

79
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:02,650
clothes,
working jobs we hate so we can buy.

80
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,520
We don't need the middle children of 
history,

81
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:08,190
man.
No purpose in place

82
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,880
and this is what frames mortise anger at
Jerry's powerlessness.

83
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,090
Jerry is the pinnacle of modern stew 
jury.

84
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,043
His existence as a cog in a meaningless 
machine is really driven home in the 

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,513
Rick Shank.
Redemption or the Galactic Federation 

86
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:22,434
keeps everyone compliant and docile 
through a liberal use of 

87
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:26,274
pharmaceuticals.
I Galactic Federation taking over 

88
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:30,090
Earth's best thing that's ever happened 
to his family.

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,090
I just got my six promotion this week 
and I still don't know what I do.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,910
In other words,
jerry is so bad at being a person.

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,490
He thrives in a society devoid of 
freedom.

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,473
Summer show your father some respect.
He's pulling down a six chewable figure 

93
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:43,554
income.
His inability to assert himself is put 

94
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:49,080
on display in every interaction he has 
with rick.

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,033
Of course there is a version of Jerry 
who isn't in Rick's words and a nerd 

96
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:54,204
chunk of randomly assembled molecules 
drifting wherever the universe bloats 

97
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,863
and that would be jerry from 
Cronenberg's when stripped of the 

98
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:00,954
trappings of modern society,
Carey goes from being a useless hack in 

99
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:04,764
a loveless marriage to a total badass 
who seems to be keeping his marriage 

100
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,460
together.

101
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,790
This in itself is hilarious,
but with this latest episode,

102
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,653
I think Rick and more use playing with 
this idea that the trappings of modern 

103
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:20,120
society are inherently alienating and 
create Jerry's out of all of us.

104
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,830
After rick introduces electricity to the
wasteland,

105
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,040
it's soon resembles a modern 
industrialized society.

106
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,620
Summers,
violent lifestyle has been traded in for

107
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:31,800
every day.
Banalities she is an out murdering ubs.

108
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,673
She's grocery shopping for human bits.
The savagery of the death stalkers has 

109
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:39,030
been reduced to complaining about 
recycling and hemorrhage.

110
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,340
The murdering machine,
is that what good for nothing.

111
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,174
Couch potato.
You haven't moved since I left to 

112
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:47,760
scavenge this morning.
What's so clever here is the implication

113
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,640
that modern comforts are what drive our 
banal,

114
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,474
terrible lives with no mutans to fend 
off people resort to bickering about 

115
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,190
trivialities.
We noticed that you've been put in scrap

116
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,150
metal in the boom.
I got it.

117
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,203
Due to electricity.
People aren't murdering each other in 

118
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,610
the blood dome.
They're watching blood doe see most post

119
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,444
apocalyptic fiction functions as a 
cautionary tale of how awful our lives 

120
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,940
might become.
But of course,

121
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,774
being the darkest show on TV,
rick and morty goes out of its way to 

122
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:21,170
prove that modern life is its own 
special brand of soul.

123
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
Crushing our comforts eventually 
alienate us from meaning creating 

124
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,633
different kinds of misery.
Or as Rick says about ruining summer's 

125
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:28,994
marriage.
Grandpa just sped things up with a few 

126
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:34,250
creature comforts of modern society.
So here's an interesting question that's

127
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,380
a bit speculative,
but the summer,

128
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,214
forgive her father because she sees that
modernization turns every man into an 

129
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:41,894
action list slow,
even if you're a post apocalyptic 

130
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,883
badass.
Now I want to speculate a little bit 

131
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,000
about Jerry here.
It's likely that rick will stay the same

132
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,890
old uncaring ass he's ever been.

133
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,250
But I think we're gonna see a lot of 
character growth in his family members.

134
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,360
Specifically.
Jerry,

135
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,930
what if he has a tyler durden moment 
with the Cronenberg Sherry?

136
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,943
What if he liked Edward Norton goes from
being a disaffected modern buffoon to a 

137
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:07,970
man of action.
I mean the show has countless references

138
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,804
to popular cinema and I think a fight 
club shout out would work perfect for 

139
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,700
Jerry's season three arc.
But Hey,

140
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,280
I guess we're just going to have to see 
as season three continues.

141
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,443
Thanks a lot for watching guys.
