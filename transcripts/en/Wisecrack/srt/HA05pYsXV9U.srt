00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,750
Hey guys,
stick around to the end of the video for

2
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:05,160
a behind the scenes look of what we got 
cooking up for the future of wise crack.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,370
Enjoy the show.
Hey,

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:11,634
wise crack jared here.
So just like everyone else with a ps 

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,054
four,
I've been grinding my thumbs to nubs 

6
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,814
playing God of war,
and if you haven't had the pleasure to 

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,544
play it yet,
things are pretty different this time 

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:22,970
around.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
That's the thing.
Change the forest feels different.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,890
Everything is different.
Do well on it.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,970
Instead of a roid raging Greek god of 
destruction who experience points,

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,483
Credo says,
now a melancholy dream daddy complete 

13
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:42,634
with a child in a dead wife.
This stark changing credos got me 

14
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:46,564
thinking,
is this part of a much larger 

15
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:51,580
zeitgeisty?
See something is happening to our heroes

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,503
and if you don't believe me,
look no further than wolverine and Luke 

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,800
Skywalker.
How to Wolverine?

18
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:00,250
Go from this colorful murder machine to 
this angsty old man.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,383
And how did luke go from this starry 
eyed vendor keen to this disenchanted 

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,700
recluse?
And in the same vein,

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,563
how did Credo Sco from this blade 
swinging harbinger of death to this 

22
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,070
bummed out widower?
Well,

23
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:12,904
to figure out why this is happening,
we're going to have to visit the era 

24
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:18,340
defined by the king of swagger,
the Duke.

25
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,383
Welcome this wise crack addition on the 
age of the post hero and stay frosty 

26
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,580
guys.
Spoilers ahead.

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,860
Before the marvel industrial complex was
even a glimmer in Stanley's I,

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,120
there was another genre that dominated 
film and an all too familiar way.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,250
The Western,
according to theorist,

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,090
will ride all westerns are born from one
basic formulation,

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,470
the story of a loan stranger who rides 
into a troubled town and cleans it up.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,650
Winning the respect of the townsfolk and
the love of the school,

33
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:48,484
Barb.
The other plots are all built upon its 

34
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,920
symbolic foundation.
Westerns from the likes of John Ford,

35
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,100
Clint Eastwood,
and Sergio Leone dominated the Hollywood

36
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:57,934
landscape for decades.
There was no need for iron man or 

37
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,324
captain America when you had Clint 
Eastwood being a bad ass and John Wayne 

38
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:07,630
leaking Americana all over every set.
He walked on.

39
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,960
Young Fella,
if you're looking for trouble,

40
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:13,750
I'll accommodate you.
So what happened?

41
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,180
Where'd all the cowboys go?
Well,

42
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:18,820
Hollywood had a sort of western 
backlash.

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,920
Instead of producing traditional 
Westerns,

44
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,843
they started making a kind of anti 
western or what were called post 

45
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,104
westerns.
Whereas your traditional western wood 

46
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,714
basket in the heroics of this gigantic,
much of a livermore post western would 

47
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,020
show us this

48
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,090
slim gimme Gimme some water.
Please flip flip.

49
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,663
The basic idea is that post westerns 
redeployed Western tropes to make new 

50
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:52,330
arguments about the ideas that westerns 
took for granted.

51
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,680
Now,
like anything else,

52
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,514
it's easier to show you how it works.
So let's take a look at a true classic 

53
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:01,630
post Western unforgiven.
Unforgiven follows William Money,

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,493
a retired gunslinger who's legendary.
Talent for shooting was fueled by his 

55
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,030
old friend whiskey.

56
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,150
I like whiskey done.
Unless there's anything else.

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years

58
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,463
now.
Sober and trying to live a peaceful 

59
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,140
life.
Raising pigs.

60
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,160
William gets pulled back into the 
gunslinger life to save his farm.

61
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,994
And family.
Unforgiven is a post western because it 

62
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,520
takes the formulation of the western and
flips it.

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,820
The heroes aren't mysterious and hardly 
clean anything up,

64
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,863
but rather bring chaos with them in a 
quest for peace that isn't about a town 

65
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,830
or ranch,
but about themselves and the future.

66
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,750
This structure of the hero leaving the 
world of violence and mid behind only to

67
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:50,470
be pulled back in is exactly the 
structure of you guessed it,

68
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,290
the god of war,
Logan and the last Jedi.

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,453
In fact,
they resemble the qualities of a post 

70
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,410
western almost perfectly.
So let's start with God of war.

71
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,900
Credos left behind his violent past,

72
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,550
went to the woods to raise a family 
after his wife dies,

73
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,920
dns on a tray and travel across the 
realm.

74
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:10,754
Sue sprinkle her ashes from the tallest 
peak so we can already see a retired 

75
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:17,030
warrior looking for a calm life of 
chopping down trees,

76
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,100
hunting and yelling at his son.
Look at me,

77
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,020
boy,
boy,

78
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,870
boy,
boy,

79
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,980
boy,
boy,

80
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,843
boy,
boy.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,300
But of course nothing is easy and he 
gets roped back in.

82
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:27,134
When bulger gets wind of his presence 
and tries to hunt him in a tray is on 

83
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:34,490
their journey similar to William Money,
who must drink whiskey to revert back to

84
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:38,510
the legendary murderer in order to save 
the town and ensure his family safety.

85
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,493
Credo says forced to bust out the chaos 
blades and revert to the death machine 

86
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:47,030
we know and love in order to save a 
trace immediately he's confronted by the

87
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,420
ghosts of his past and the reality that 
he can't escape it.

88
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,630
You cannot change.
You will sound familiar.

89
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,960
Just like Credo slogan used to be a 
turbo badass death dealer.

90
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,810
I mean his bones are covered in metal,
but wait,

91
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,180
who's that living in the desert like 
some kind of weird hermit.

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,193
It's our boy wolverine,
but he's old and sad and has a daughter 

93
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:20,690
now and goes by Logan,

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,190
your uh,
but we took you in.

95
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,670
You have logan imagines be wolverine as 
a past.

96
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,504
His prime limo driver who takes care of 
his elderly foster father in the first 

97
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,004
few minutes of the film,
his aversion to violence has put on 

98
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:42,590
display.
You don't want to do what's soon.

99
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,424
He's caught up protecting a young girl 
from assassins cyborgs and other goons 

100
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,523
like in God of war and unforgiven.
Logan is only drawn back into violence 

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,310
by his desire to protect and help a 
younger generation,

102
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,353
but despite his intentions,
the violence follows him and innocent 

103
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,314
families.
Farm is turned into a slaughterhouse in 

104
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,074
response.
Logan tries again to leave the violence 

105
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:05,774
behind,
but it sneaks back into his life as 

106
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,294
Laura and the other children are 
captured and Logan's got to do some 

107
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,140
savings.
Finally,

108
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,974
he comes to terms with the violence,
takes a serum like a certain whiskey 

109
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:20,690
shot and goes hog wild.
He embraces the violence as the only way

110
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:25,691
to save Laura and finally finds peace 
similar to unforgiven.

111
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,700
Not to mention Shane,

112
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,030
there's no going back,
right or wrong.

113
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,620
It's brand brand sticks,

114
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,533
logan and God of war.
Show us a former warrior turned 

115
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:40,684
protector who must swap the shield for a
sword or a gun or clause or blades of 

116
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:45,964
chaos,
despite the fact that all they want is 

117
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:52,000
to leave that life behind a try over and
over to get away,

118
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,620
but they get pulled back.
In.

119
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Test what I thought I was out credos 
once a peaceful life for his son,

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,880
and that means war with the gods.
Logan wants to protect Laura.

121
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,590
That means releasing the beast.

122
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,573
Money wants to help his kids.
That means hunting down those who might 

123
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:12,934
come after him.
It's the choice to confront their 

124
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:19,030
painful nature for the sake of helping 
others that ultimately redeemed credos,

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,950
logan and money.
So how does the last Jedi?

126
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,580
I fit into this.
It's not quite the same,

127
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,430
but just as those characters are forced 
to Donna Mantle,

128
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:30,430
they've dreamt of leaving behind,
so to does space.

129
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:31,750
Hobo,
Luke Skywalker,

130
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,630
he isolates himself,
renounces his legend,

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,553
and even gives up using the force,
I suppose just as the Post Western 

132
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,210
reevaluates the glory of the traditional
Western.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,073
So too does the last jet.
I reevaluate the deeds of the jet I 

134
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:53,710
order and the mess they've left the 
galaxy in at the height of their powers.

135
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:57,040
They allowed God city cities to rise,
create the empire and wiped them out.

136
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,473
It was a jetta I master who's 
responsible for the training and 

137
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:01,774
creation of Darth vader,
but when the resistance is about to be 

138
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:08,350
completely snuffed out,
Luke must stop fleeing from his past and

139
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:10,150
reignite the legend,
once again,

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,073
to sustain the light and save his sister
is ready to die because just like the 

141
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:18,100
other characters,
he's giving something to the future.

142
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,190
The myth of scale.
So why is this happening to our heroes?

143
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,780
Well,
it all goes back to myths.

144
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,890
As Right said,
a myth is a communication from a society

145
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:30,724
to its members.
The social concepts and attitudes 

146
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:33,964
determined by the history and 
institutions of a society are 

147
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:39,490
communicated to its members through its 
myths.

148
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,443
Put simply,
myths are the stories society tells 

149
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:43,474
itself about itself.
That's why we saw the posts western 

150
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,240
emerge in the shadow of Watergate and 
Vietnam.

151
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,313
We needed stories that reflected an age 
of distrust in institutions and a lack 

152
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:54,814
of belief in the American myth.
It's similar to where we ended up as a 

153
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,554
culture after the 2008 financial crisis 
and why suddenly we're seeing this 

154
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,114
pattern reemerge all over the place.
We're even seeing this self critical 

155
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,660
turn in the greatest mythic framework of
our time,

156
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,960
the superhero movie.
Think about the best marvel movies.

157
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,823
Winter soldier has captain America,
the poster boy for the American way 

158
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,210
questioning the US government for not 
just taking down the carriers.

159
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:22,050
Neck were taken down,
shields or learns,

160
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:22,884
a real leader has to confront their 
nations ugly history and all the pain 

161
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:26,694
that comes with that.
Tony Stark has space combat ptsd and 

162
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,444
iron man three and in civil war.
The consequences of his actions come 

163
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,254
back to haunt him.
Even Superman has issues figuring out 

164
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:37,824
right and wrong,
which is the one thing superman is 

165
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:43,260
supposed to know for sure.
None of our mythical figures are spared,

166
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,410
and this is what I mean by the age of 
the post zero.

167
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,180
If Post westerns emerged as people tired
of the same myths from an era passed our

168
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:54,930
post heroes like Credos,
logan and Luke skywalker's signaling the

169
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:55,764
same,
and we're currently in the process of 

170
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:58,644
questioning our cultural myths.
What kind of myths will we make to 

171
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,484
replace them?
And what will these myths tell us about 

172
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,720
the society we want to build?

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,910
Thanks for watching guys and thanks for 
sticking around.

174
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,400
Things may look like business as usual 
on the channel,

175
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:14,234
but we've actually been busting our ass 
cooking up some awesome new pilots 

176
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:17,564
behind the scenes,
so we're working on more shows about 

177
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:21,350
movies,
a couple of shows about current events,

178
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,110
more about science and even a show about
the stock market.

179
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:27,830
So I'm going to give you guys a little 
sneak peek as to what's in the works.

180
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,773
All right,
so first up we got to show that is 

181
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,494
actually premiering in late June called 
the film tourists where I go inside 

182
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:35,144
cinema classics and break down the film 
techniques that make them smart and 

183
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:40,820
effective.
So where we usually talk about ideology,

184
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:41,654
philosophy in subtext here we're going 
to be focusing more on the form and the 

185
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:48,950
technique and how those things make the 
films so darn good.

186
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,053
Yes,
there I am inhabiting the shot of the 

187
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,330
wolf of Wall Street.

188
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,060
The next one we got up is called how did
we get here,

189
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:56,894
which is an animated series with a super
talented artists that I went to college 

190
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:00,860
with.
Her name is tyler.

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,560
I'm so excited to be able to bring her 
vision to the world.

192
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,100
This is going to be exploring current 
events and the forces that shape them.

193
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:11,140
So this pilot episode is actually about 
fake news and Fahrenheit 4:51,

194
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,983
the Ray Bradbury book.
Other thing we have going on is another 

195
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:14,414
explainer series and it's more about 
culture criticism in terms of real life 

196
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,163
contemporary stuff.
So our first episode is called was the 

197
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:20,924
Internet a mistake?
We're working with the amazing 

198
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,043
illustrator of thug notes and I'm super 
excited to be talking about current 

199
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:28,910
events and talking about stuff that's 
outside of media.

200
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,863
We're also working on new science shows,
so I'm sure you guys have seen our new 

201
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,254
host,
Helen has been doing stuff like the 

202
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:37,520
psychology of the purge and the 
psychology of one punch man.

203
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,383
We've got more of those kinds of videos 
in the works as well as Helen has been 

204
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:45,200
working with a doctor at the University 
of Southern California.

205
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,093
His name is Dr Jonas Kaplan and he is a 
neuroscientist and he's actually giving 

206
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:49,244
us access to a neuroscience imaging 
machine and we actually want to do kind 

207
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:53,474
of our own experiments to see if we can 
draw conclusions about how the brain 

208
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,364
reacts not only to media but to various 
things that we experienced on social 

209
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,080
media.
So this is kind of a dream come true for

210
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:02,914
me because I've always wanted wisecrack 
to not only be about reflecting on 

211
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,373
studies,
but being a part of the research and 

212
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,210
studies process.
So we're also working on a money show.

213
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,890
So for those of you who listened to our 
podcast,

214
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,880
show me the meaning.
You know,

215
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,450
Ryan Ryan has been our editor for the 
last four years and he's going to try to

216
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:20,420
get quote stupid rich by investing in 
stuff like cryptocurrencies,

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,480
penny stocks and possibly sex robots.

218
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,840
So learning about how to be good with 
money through Ryan being crazy.

219
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:26,650
It's gonna.
Be Fun.

220
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,300
Also our pow,
Greg Edwards,

221
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,940
the Genius Behind Thug Notes,
Aka sparky suites,

222
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,783
Phd,
will be returning to wisecrack with a 

223
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,230
new comedy podcasts that we're 
developing together.

224
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,560
And you may have seen some awesome new 
animations and graphics appearing around

225
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,420
the channel.
We're working with the really,

226
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,254
really talented Mike Perry.
So if you guys have ever seen broad 

227
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,080
city,
the intro,

228
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:44,914
which was the interstitials between 
commercials is designed by him and he's 

229
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,720
looking to get wise cracking all new 
look.

230
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,430
And we're really excited to be working 
with him.

231
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,264
So get ready for more cool like that.
That's what we got in the works for you
