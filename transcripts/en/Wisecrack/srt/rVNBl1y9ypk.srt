What's up everyone?

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,950
Disembodied,
jared again,

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,903
man,
the DCEU has had a pretty rough go of 

6
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,204
it.
We've already broken down what went 

7
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,900
wrong in Batman v Superman and suicide 
squad,

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,810
but today we're going back to the source
of all these issues.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,733
The movie that began Zack Snyder's 
vision of the DC universe that gave 

10
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,200
birth to mustache gape,
tramp stamp,

11
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,250
joker,
Momoa,

12
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,600
dead eyes.
Wonder woman.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,830
Okay,
that one was pretty great.

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,843
They never ending,
will they or won't they all ultimately 

15
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:35,514
leading to the tragically bland 
corporate mandated void that is the 

16
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,534
justice league.
But none of this would exist if it 

17
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:46,671
weren't for the film that set the tone 
man of steel by trying to graph darkness

18
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:49,560
and grit onto a character devoid of such
qualities,

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,420
man of steel stumbles into a mess that 
would ultimately doom the DCEU.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,433
So let's rotate the earth back half a 
decade and see how the Dcu went so 

21
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,060
wrong.
So early.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,550
Welcome to this wisecrack addition on 
man of steel.

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,520
What went wrong,
and as always spoilers ahead.

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
Back in 2013 DC films was riding high 
after the critical and financial success

25
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,230
of Christopher Nolan's dark knight 
trilogy.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,273
Those films successfully merge the pop 
aesthetic of a superhero film with a 

27
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,940
previously unmatched sense of weight.
No one explored.

28
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,774
The darker aspects of being the Batman 
questioning whether the vigilante 

29
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,344
himself was a destructive force,
did Batman beak in the very cycle of 

30
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,320
violence he fights against with the 
joker,

31
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,154
Bain,
and all the rest of these villains ever 

32
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,370
have come to fruition if he didn't 
exist.

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,580
If true,
what good is Batman are suppose it hero?

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,420
Is he a necessary evil?
These are weighty questions to ask.

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,290
And yet the dark knight trilogy never 
tipped over into pump hostility.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,160
The rare superhero films to be both 
smart and entertaining.

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,173
It's no surprise then that DC wanted to 
recreate this same success with their 

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,580
other tentpole comic character,
Superman.

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,830
I mean those Christopher Nolan Batman 
films.

40
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,664
Sure we're successful.
So why not do the exact same thing for 

41
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,780
superman?
Seems like a sure fire hit.

42
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,570
What could go wrong?
So the powers that be hired,

43
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:07,404
another dark and gritty filmmaker,
watchman in 300 Zack Snyder brought in 

44
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:11,694
the co writer of the Dark Knight Trilogy
and even gave our boy Nolan a story 

45
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,970
credit and producer role.
There's just one little problem.

46
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,043
Superman isn't that feed darkness and 
weight intrinsic to Batman and 

47
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:27,780
emotionally scarred vigilante avenging 
the death of his parents just isn't true

48
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,460
for Superman.
On the contrary,

49
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,550
Superman is supposed to be the ideal,
all powerful,

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,413
yet completely pure.
There's not a malevolent bone in his 

51
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:38,490
body.
He's the ultimate good guy.

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,520
So how the hell do you impose darkness,
grit,

53
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:46,080
and weight onto the symbol of hope on my
world?

54
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:49,620
It means hope for Snyder.
The answer didn't lie with Superman,

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,513
but in the world around him,
America has changed a whole lot since 

56
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,714
Superman's comic book introduction in 
1938 where once upon a time the good 

57
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,580
guys and bad guys were easy to deduce 
and label.

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,200
At the time,
man of steel was written.

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,960
The endless war on terror had muddied 
the waters,

60
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,620
one ton of obey Sinophobia and 
insufficient veteran services.

61
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,454
Painting America as a far cry from the 
supposed shining city on a hill man of 

62
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,170
steel.
Questions.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,350
If Superman,
the embodiment of the American ideal can

64
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,260
survive in the current disillusioned 
America,

65
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,080
will he be accepted or rejected?
Ostensibly,

66
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,110
it's a coming out story where this 
central question becomes,

67
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,880
should superman revealed himself to 
society and lest anyone ever accused man

68
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,714
of steel of being subtle.
When Clark first discovers his powers 

69
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,790
during class,
he runs away and hides out in,

70
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,200
you guessed it,
a closet.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,273
So what answer does the film provide?
Should Superman remain in the closet or 

72
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,660
reveal his powers and save the world 
like the hero he's always been?

73
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,763
Well,
the answer becomes far darker and 

74
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,254
murkier than you'd expect after young 
Clark saves a bus full of students from 

75
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,604
drowning.
Jonathan Kent tells him that maybe he 

76
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:58,450
shouldn't have.
What was I supposed to do?

77
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,323
Just let him die.

78
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,840
Maybe

79
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,673
let that sink in.
The All American dad tells the 

80
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,230
burgeoning hero he should probably just 
let a bunch of children drown.

81
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,770
The crazier part man of steel treats us 
advice as sound.

82
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,783
Jonathan in the same scene tells Clark 
that there's more at stake than the 

83
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,790
lives of a bunch of children in the 
world finds out what you can do.

84
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,140
It's going to change everything or

85
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,600
our beliefs or our notions of what it 
means to be human.

86
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,493
Everything.

87
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,880
Jonathan fears that when confronted with
WHO and what Clark is,

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,640
people will fear and reject him.
Humanities,

89
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:41,570
very reality will shatter and the 
results won't be pretty,

90
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,760
and guess what?
Throughout man of steel,

91
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:44,594
we see this to be exactly the case.
When Clark hides in the closet after 

92
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:51,080
discovering his powers,
he hears the children afraid of him.

93
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,823
When Perry Mason,
here's about the possibility of 

94
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,370
Superman's existence.
He remarks.

95
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,010
Can you imagine how people on this 
planet would react?

96
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,730
They knew there was someone like this 
out there,

97
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,310
even lowest lane.
Superman's true.

98
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,880
Paramour is afraid when she first sees 
the Almighty alien.

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,993
The questions raised by my rescuer.
Subsistence are frightening to 

100
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,624
contemplate.

101
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,130
If Clark does decide to come out,
well,

102
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:25,670
it could end in his death.
Case in point as a teenager,

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,430
Clark is framed reading a book on the 
philosopher Plato.

104
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,533
Plato actually detailed.
What would happen if a perfectly just 

105
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,060
and righteous man were to ever come into
the world.

106
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,610
A man just like Superman in the 
republic,

107
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,640
one of Socrates's pals suggest that this
perfect van,

108
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,830
we'll be scourged.
Rack bound,

109
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,783
evil of his eyes burned out and it lasts
after suffering every kind of evil he 

110
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:48,254
will be impale so not good.
If Superman were to reveal his identity 

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,400
and notably people would turn against 
him and seek to kill him.

112
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,100
A fake.
We see play out in v Superman.

113
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,460
Snyder drives this point home by 
comparing the hero to the other.

114
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,810
All good being in human history.
Jesus was an act of God.

115
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,644
Jonathan,
this was providence when Clark debates 

116
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:10,934
with,
they preached about whether he should 

117
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,380
reveal his identity.

118
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,303
He's framed in the foreground,
would they stained glass depiction of 

119
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,094
Jesus in the background and later when 
Superman rescues lowest from an escape 

120
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,084
pod,
we see him in the classic crucifixion 

121
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,730
pose.
Again,

122
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,623
not very subtle by comparing superman 
with Christ snider as a real sense of 

123
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,604
foreboding to man of steel because well,
we all know how Jesus's story ends and 

124
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:36,650
here in lies the problem.
Clark has to become superman because the

125
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,080
movie's called man of steel,
not hipster,

126
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:39,914
sad beard man,
but man of steel puts itself into a 

127
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,890
corner where it's constantly arguing.
Clark shouldn't reveal his powers,

128
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,470
that if he does become superman,
you will be feared,

129
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:50,120
hated,
and inevitably murdered.

130
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,420
There's no logical reason for Clark to 
reveal himself to the world.

131
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,120
So this leads to two issues.
One,

132
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,180
Clark becomes a reluctant hero and to 
the entire film becomes a refusal of the

133
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,930
call.

134
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,763
Now,
the reluctant hero is a well worn 

135
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,924
narrative archetype in which a person is
thrust into circumstance where he must 

136
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,870
save the day despite never really 
wanting to do so.

137
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,590
Think Han Solo in star wars or John 
mcclane in die hard.

138
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,440
This hero doesn't ever look to save 
anybody.

139
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,080
He's just drawn into situations where he
must.

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,033
Similarly,
Clark doesn't look to save anybody in 

141
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,524
man of steel.
He just sort of ends up at the right 

142
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,520
place at the right time.
The school bus crash,

143
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,960
well,
Clark's already on the bus,

144
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,680
so why not the oil rig disaster Clarkson
in nearby fishing boat.

145
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,910
So why not?
Again,

146
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,893
lowest gets attacked by a tentacle that 
just sketch Clark's only a couple feet 

147
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,740
away.
You get the point.

148
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,610
But this reluctant hero archetype is the
antithesis of the superman myths.

149
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,010
If Superman is the ideal,
we strive to be the hero among heroes.

150
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,360
Then his reluctance to save anybody runs
contrary to his ethos.

151
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,940
Further by making superman a reluctant 
hero,

152
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,720
it turns him into a passive character.
Things happen to Clark.

153
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,070
The bus crashed the oil rig disaster or 
a stage five tornado as opposed to Clark

154
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:04,904
leading the narrative through action.
The entire film in turn becomes a 

155
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,990
refusal of the call for Joseph 
Campbell's Hero's journey.

156
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,150
When our hero is first called into 
action,

157
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:14,984
he chooses to refuse often because 
staying at home is easier and far less 

158
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:20,300
dangerous.
For example,

159
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,163
in Star Wars,
a new hope luke initially refuses to 

160
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,254
help Obiwan safe Princess Leia.
It's only when Luke returns home to see 

161
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:27,764
his house destroyed and his aunt and 
uncle dead that he decides to take up 

162
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,574
action.
The refusal of the call is typically 

163
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:36,540
only a brief stop on the hero's journey 
and Campbell's monomyth.

164
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,260
It takes up less than a 17th of the 
hero's journey.

165
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,150
Get in man of steel.

166
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,983
Clark refuses the call to become 
superman for over half the film more 

167
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,903
than an hour of runtime.
Imagine if luke had spent over an hour 

168
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:53,810
contemplating the pros and cons of using
the force you'd grow to hate the guy.

169
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,190
This becomes the problem.
Man of steel.

170
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,083
Clark spends so much time debating the 
merits of becoming a hero that in the 

171
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,150
end he seems like a bit of a Dick.
I mean,

172
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,013
he's an almighty,
all powerful being who can save the 

173
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,864
earth on one leg with only his pinkie,
and yet we the audience are as to 

174
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,650
sympathize with why he shouldn't save 
anybody.

175
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,380
When Jonathan Ken gets sucked up into a 
tornado,

176
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,490
man of steel's intent is to depict the 
moment as a tragic lesson,

177
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,620
but in execution,
well,

178
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,454
it's far less.
Clark could save his Paul from imminent 

179
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,090
death but can't because doing so would 
reveal his powers to too many.

180
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,040
I let my father die

181
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,593
because I trusted him because he was 
convinced that I had to wait at the 

182
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,100
world is not ready

183
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,321
yet.
Again,

184
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:45,590
man of steel treats this as a completely
reasonable action,

185
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,810
like of course that's what anyone would 
do.

186
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,440
Superman's just let us father die 
because there's at least 25 people under

187
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,160
the bridge watching even more.
The blame is placed on the world.

188
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,410
It's our fault.
Jonathan Kent died.

189
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,333
We're to ennoble,
not the superhero that could've saved 

190
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:01,341
him in.
Oh,

191
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:02,600
I don't know,
two seconds.

192
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,580
Man of steel carries the cynicism to its
conclusion where superman in Zod duke it

193
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,414
out in metropolis,
nonchalantly killing hundreds of 

194
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,210
thousands if not more,
but it's not superman who is cavalier to

195
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,640
this loss of life,
but the film itself,

196
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,593
man of steel doesn't realize the 
implication this conclusion has on 

197
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:21,224
superman and his heroic ethos.
The ending has treated it as a triumph 

198
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,570
superman,
defeat sod and saves the world.

199
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,610
Who cares about a couple hundred 
thousand extras?

200
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,110
Lois is fine.
Get over it.

201
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,270
Humanity never even accept superman.
After Clark reveals his powers and sorta

202
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:36,104
saves metropolis.
The government tracks in with a drone 

203
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,880
questioning his motives.
How do we know you're woke one day?

204
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:44,870
Act against America's interests.
Superman two doesn't trust humanity.

205
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,823
Destroying the Afa mentioned drone and 
telling the government to take a hike 

206
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,140
that they'll never find out where he 
hangs his cake.

207
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,410
So in the end,
the uneasy relationship between humanity

208
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:59,411
and superman is still well exactly that 
the world's still isn't ready.

209
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,823
Early in man of Steel Clarksburg,
Father Jarell echoes the idealistic 

210
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:06,080
sentiments of Superman's past.

211
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,420
You will give the people of,
uh,

212
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,703
an ideal to strive tool.
All right behind you that will stumble 

213
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,673
fall,
but in time they will join you in the 

214
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Sun Gow and time it will help them 
accomplish one.

215
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,910
This is the Superman of the 1930s of 
Richard Donner and Christopher Reed.

216
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,080
But the words ring hollow in Snyder's 
morally obfuscated worldview.

217
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,153
By the end of man of steel.
Snyder has crafted a superman who 

218
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:42,544
shouldn't have saved a bus full of 
children who let his father die and 

219
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:49,090
destroyed the city.
He sought to protect all the idealism of

220
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:49,924
yesteryear has been sucked out.
Leaving a hollow shell were one stood 

221
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,410
beacon of hope.
Man of steel's intent is to pave the way

222
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,244
for Superman and the Dcu to showcase the
uplifting origins of the greatest of 

223
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,330
heroes and begin a multi crossover film 
franchise.

224
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,343
But in reality,
the film has the exact opposite 

225
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:10,150
reaction,
the wanton destruction of the third act,

226
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,330
the wishy washy hero,
the morally obfuscated world,

227
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,283
all paint a picture far from idealistic.
This isn't an uplifting story of a hero 

228
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,980
coming into his own and being accepted 
by the world.

229
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,100
This is a story of a hero being forced 
into hiding,

230
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,993
ultimately rejected in fear by the 
government and the people he seeks to 

231
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,960
protect that darkness and grit the very 
thing man of steel ads,

232
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,720
ironically enough becomes its own 
undoing,

233
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,930
swallowing up the inherent goodness of 
its central character,

234
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,580
turning the beginnings of the Dcu 
franchise into the origins of its end.
