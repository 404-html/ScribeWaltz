1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,843
A wise crack jared incarnate again,
and we've got another wise crack quick 

2
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:09,610
take on this week's rick and morty.
Episode Pickle Rick.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,880
I'm pickle.
I'm here to answer the question,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,060
why does rick turned into a pickle and 
yes,

5
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:19,300
it's partly because Dan Harmon said,
rick is a pickle in a writer's room,

6
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:20,890
brainstorm harm,
and just goes,

7
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:21,724
oh,
and then there's the other easy answer 

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,380
to avoid family therapy,
but if you stick with me,

9
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:30,850
I'm going to argue that rick's being as 
pickle can teach us a lot about freedom,

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,870
woken loose,
wise,

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,703
crack quick,
take on pickle rick and of course 

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,240
spoilers ahead,
but first a recap.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,830
Rick,
if you couldn't produce,

14
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,530
has turned himself into a pickle to get 
out of family therapy,

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,483
but things go awry and he ends up 
fighting his way out of a sewer and 

16
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,270
later a Russian embassy using a Mech 
suit made out of Roche parts and rap.

17
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:50,104
Lynn's meanwhile,
Beth summer and morty have to go to 

18
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:52,804
family therapy after summer huffed 
pottery and animal and morty peed his 

19
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:56,524
pants.
There's a clever parallel between Beth 

20
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:58,954
and rick in this episode,
just as Rick goes to insane lengths to 

21
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:02,764
avoid bearing his emotions and therapy.
Beth is doing her best to stonewall her 

22
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,900
school,
appointed therapist,

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,090
and maintain her emotional distance.

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,380
I think it's possible that you and your 
father have a very specific dynamic.

25
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,410
I don't think it's one that rewards 
emotion or vulnerability.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,244
I think it may punish them.
I think it's possible that dynamic you 

27
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:23,830
voted your marriage and as infecting 
your kids with the tendency to Mr.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Hack their feelings,

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,853
both of you to one thing we've noticed 
in the season is that there's more 

30
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:34,410
emphasis on serialized arcs.
In the last episode,

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,303
Rick is willing to stay in Mad Max land 
to avoid dealing with his daughters 

32
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,114
divorce.
My Dad has gone through a divorce and I 

33
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,590
am not dealing with it in a healthy way 
at all.

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Now he's literally turned himself into a
pickle to run away from reality,

35
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,690
and Mourdian summers seem increasingly 
damaged by their parents' divorce.

36
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,623
I am mad that I can't have enamel 
without people assuming it's because my 

37
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,130
family is sex.
With

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,133
continuation,
we've noticed a few themes that seem to 

39
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:05,110
be slowly developing.
One of which is freedom.

40
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,800
This quote from Dr Wong really sets the 
stage for our discussion.

41
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,783
I think it's because the only truly 
unapproachable concept for you is that 

42
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:16,960
it's your mind within your control.
You chose to come here.

43
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:19,480
You chose to talk to belittle my 
vocation.

44
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,710
Just as you chose to become a pickle.
Each of us gets to choose.

45
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,783
At first,
Dr Wong's monologue seemed a little 

46
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:27,760
strange.
After all,

47
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,250
how could rick not understand that he's 
in control?

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,370
He can do anything including turned 
himself into a pickle.

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,980
The reason anyone would do this,
if they could,

50
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,170
which they can't,
would be because they could,

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,033
which they can,
but after digging through my notes on 

52
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,704
the ugliest of existential philosophers,
I think Dr Wong's monologue gets us to 

53
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:47,440
something quite insightful.
As we all know,

54
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:49,900
Rick doesn't believe in God.
There is no god.

55
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,460
Summer.
Got to rip that bandaid off.

56
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,294
Now.
You'll thank me later and for 

57
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:54,400
philosophers,
John Paul Sarte.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Godlessness means we are radically free 
to define our own existence,

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,313
but we choose to do things based on 
social pressures or who we think we're 

60
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,530
supposed to be,
and all kinds of other bolts start calls

61
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,950
this acting in bad faith,
but since we're mortal,

62
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,590
there's a fixed amount of choices to 
make in our lives.

63
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,610
What sarc calls finitude,
and each of those choices prevents other

64
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,444
choices.
Choosing to be a truck driver means 

65
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,634
choosing not to be a teacher.
To deny the importance of our finite 

66
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,860
choices is another way to act in bad 
faith.

67
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,030
Often we pretend to not have a choice as
west side story puts it.

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,561
Hi,
nick.

69
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:29,394
Sergeant,
crop,

70
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,393
yet gotta understand.
It's just odd bringing upkeep that gets 

71
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,970
us out of hand.
Our mothers are junkies are fathers,

72
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,840
all are drunks.
Golly.

73
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,980
Most naturally your punks,

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,440
essentially the hopelessness know 
they're acting like a bunch of little,

75
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,280
but instead of choosing to be better,
they relinquished their choice and blame

76
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:49,800
it on their negligent parents.
That's why I'm so bad.

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,753
They just can't help themselves.
But what's unique about rick is that he 

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,090
doesn't deal with finitude.
He deals with infinitude.

79
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,390
My access to infinite timelines 
precludes the necessity of attachment.

80
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,253
Rick has to grapple with the exact 
opposite of what SARC proposed because 

81
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:07,470
to call back to season one,
there's an infinite number of realities.

82
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:08,304
Morty rest,
SARC criticizes the person who won't 

83
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:11,034
take responsibility for their choices.
Rick thinks he doesn't have to because 

84
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:17,130
he's already made them and all the 
infinite versions of himself.

85
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,410
If Stuart said the human condition was 
one,

86
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:21,060
a finite choices,
well,

87
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,030
rick has transcended that human 
condition with science,

88
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,983
but as Dr Wong suggests,
justifying your actions with the 

89
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,284
multiverse or your godlike intelligence 
isn't a solution because although 

90
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,720
intelligence can help you make a 
decision,

91
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,000
you still have to make the decision.

92
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,043
The only connection between your 
unquestionable intelligence and the 

93
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,660
sickness destroying your family is that 
everyone in your family,

94
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:46,110
you included use intelligence to justify
sickness.

95
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,980
Despite the fact that rick is the master
of his universe,

96
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,580
he paradoxically has yet to come to 
terms with his own choices.

97
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,710
No matter how many versions of Rick 
exists,

98
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,550
nothing can stop the fact that his 
choices are uniquely his own.

99
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,960
Because to quote Dr Wong,

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,913
the only truly unapproachable concept 
for you is that it's your mind within 

101
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,240
your control.

102
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,393
In season one,
Rick Straight up tells us how he deals 

103
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,120
with the infinite choice in the 
multiverse.

104
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,310
What about the reality where Hitler 
cured cancer?

105
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,110
Morty,
the answer is don't think about it,

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,830
but of course all therapy does this make
you think about things?

107
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,753
So rick turns himself into a pickle to 
avoid choice or at least the appearance 

108
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,434
of it as a helpless armless pickle.
It's not his fault if he can't make 

109
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,274
therapy,
and in that sense Rick's blatant 

110
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,450
disregard for his choices,
as SARC would say,

111
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,120
is acting in bad faith.
Speaking of arcs,

112
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,954
this ties nicely into what we talked 
about in the last episode between 

113
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,404
Jerry's powerlessness,
mortise resentment of him for that very 

114
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,494
reason,
and the juxtaposition with Rick as an 

115
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,014
all powerful madman,
but I don't respect therapy because I'm 

116
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:48,390
a scientist because I invent 
transformed,

117
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,780
create,
destroy for a living.

118
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,400
And when I don't like something about 
the world,

119
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,150
I'd change it.

120
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,983
This season is really leading into ideas
of agency and I'm super excited to see 

121
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:59,000
what they come up with next.
There's one last thing worth noting,

122
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,370
but it's probably more of a stretch.
You know,

123
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,000
the common characterization of Freud's 
work as everything is a penis.

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,953
Well,
I'm convinced someone in their writer's 

125
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,874
room probably took this loose connection
between a phallic object in therapy and 

126
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,983
who went to little wild with it.
What have you want to hear more about
