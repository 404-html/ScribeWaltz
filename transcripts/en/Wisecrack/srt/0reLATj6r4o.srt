1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Globalization today is not just the 
spread of product and ideas and money 

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,024
and even people around the world.
It's also about the arrangements that 

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,580
are made by companies to start operating
in new countries,

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,460
to open up new factories and plants and 
service operations.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,413
When companies do those things,
they typically need middlemen to help 

6
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,184
them enter those new markets,
and those middlemen can have a variety 

7
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,050
of different occupations.
You need translators.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,590
You need lawyers who can help you to 
adapt to a new legal system.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,573
You need accountants because there are 
always new accounting systems and 

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,364
regulations to you need fixers who can 
help you to find locations for your new 

11
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,850
operation,
help you to deal with local officials.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,803
You need a whole variety of people who 
are middlemen because they operate 

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
between the foreign company that's 
coming in and all of the domestic 

14
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,990
actors,
whether they be governments or companies

15
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,370
or citizens groups on the ground.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,400
This is truly important for 
globalization.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,563
Now,
where do these middlemen get their 

18
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,150
return?
Well,

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,043
they usually get paid a fee up front 
because the company is entering the new 

20
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,130
market saying,
Hey,

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,203
there is some value to our being here 
and we're willing to pay a small 

22
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,914
percentage of that value to the people 
who help us to open our operation and 

23
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,560
that small percentage is what the 
middlemen received.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,930
They get that upfront payment.
If you're a middle man,

25
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,764
this is fantastic because you can help 
one company to open an operation in a 

26
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,484
new country and then you can help 
another company and another and each 

27
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,474
time you're going to get that little 
percentage of the total value of that 

28
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,850
company's engagement with that new 
country.

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,983
Now,
middlemen have lots of opportunities 

30
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,080
here.
They can specialize in a sector.

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,960
You could work only with companies in 
oil and gas industries.

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,300
They could specialize in a country.
You can say,

33
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,134
we're going to be the law firm for any 
American company that wants to enter 

34
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,980
Ghana,
for example.

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,083
There are many ways that they could 
structure their business and economists 

36
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:52,230
have found that they are able to get 
this significant upfront payment.

37
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,940
You could say,
well,

38
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:54,774
isn't this damaging?
Doesn't this take money away from the 

39
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:57,894
company and from the people on the 
ground who might have benefit who 

40
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,010
might've benefited from the company's 
operations there?

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,113
Well,
not really because there had to be some 

42
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,024
sort of opening up the gates to allow 
these companies to come in and this is 

43
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,940
what the middle men provide in the 
longterm.

44
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,910
It's good for the economies on both 
sides.
