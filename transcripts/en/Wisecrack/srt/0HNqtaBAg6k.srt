00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,230
Hip Hop's been dying or dead every 
single year since it's inception,

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,610
so along with its eight of the top eight
downloads last week,

3
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:22,780
I feel it's not dead.
It's still got a tremendous influence in

4
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:27,100
American pop culture is still a great 
brand building community in the world.

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,460
They have all kinds of,
uh,

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,920
inspiration and influence for American 
mainstream.

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,280
They made the president by shifting a 
race,

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,430
a race dialogue.
They,

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,463
they run DMC got MTV.
There was no black people at all except 

10
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,300
Michael Jackson and he,
they,

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,143
they were,
they had ahead and changed a lot in 

12
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:52,640
America and where people see each other 
and Jay is not dead files.

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,590
I can tell this last.
Ll Cool J's on the number one show.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,100
Ice T is not dead.
He's 45.

15
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,443
I'm 51.
I got new businesses that are hip hop 

16
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:07,570
related and they're growing.
I don't feel hip hop is dead.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,660
I don't feel that any good signs that 
would say that.

18
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,110
I guess young people do download cricket
and then people would,

19
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:16,180
might buy a Whitney Houston record or 
something,

20
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:20,830
but that's just what they do.
Hip Hop is being consumed as much now as

21
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,590
ever,
and that's an important statement and it

22
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,830
has as much effect or the American 
mainstream culture now as ever,

23
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:27,664
and that's another good statement.
So it's hard to predict the death of a 

24
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,700
culture,
a cultural phenomenon that's transformed

25
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,010
America in so many ways.
