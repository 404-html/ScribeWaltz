1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,730
I was cracked.
Jared again,

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,190
you might have noticed that Sasha Baron 
Cohen,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,220
the mind behind allergy Borat Bruno and 
the dictator has a new show out with who

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,304
is America making Sarah Pailin publicly 
complaining about being duped and Roy 

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,350
more threatening to sue.
It's hard to miss.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,320
Is it possible to sign my waterboard?
Sure.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,390
Thank you.
Find the space that,

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,520
yeah,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,353
but how does Cohen do it?
How does he keep getting such high 

10
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:31,490
profile people to make fools of 
themselves on camera?

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,743
Well,
while he may land his bare ass on m and 

12
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:36,380
m space or Russell,
the occasional fat dude,

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,560
his brand of comedy is more 
sophisticated than you might think.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,970
No,
seriously.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,953
Maybe I'm mad with this dream of 
becoming a world famous artist just by 

16
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:48,590
using my income.
Am I?

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,270
I think we're all mad and it all has to 
do with cloud the creepiest con.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,533
So come float with us for this wisecrack
condition on the philosophy of Sasha 

19
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,730
Baron Cohen.
But before we get into it,

20
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:02,564
jared,
irl here and I want to give a quick 

21
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,780
shout out to our sponsors over at better
health.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,853
Better help is online counseling with 
licensed professionals that's 

23
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:11,180
accessible,
confidential,

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,030
and works around your schedule.
I tried it myself,

25
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,580
so stay tuned to the end to hear more 
about my experience.

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,360
In the meantime,
check better help.com/wise

27
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:20,194
crack five to learn more.
And now on the Sasha in case you don't 

28
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:27,080
know who Sasha Baron Cohen is,
he rose to fame in the late nineties for

29
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:30,470
his brief segments on UK tvs,
the 11 o'clock show,

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,483
which also gave rise to Ricky Gervais'.
His sketches were based around a 

31
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:36,620
character initially called the Youth 
Lanka.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,513
He was dressed like a stereotypical 
chaff or a British insult for obnoxious 

33
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:41,894
lower class kids who had delusions of 
being part of the gangster rap 

34
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,330
lifestyle.

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,750
The limbo stains from the house.
Is it good sized truck

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,393
character transformed into what we now 
know as allergy allergy started by 

37
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,714
interviewing British establishment 
figures with pompous titles who are 

38
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:02,650
desperate to seem down with the kids,
but predictably this always backfires

39
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,520
perhaps,
or they bathed in us as milk.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,700
She often exposed how out of touch those
politicians and academics could be.

41
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,080
It's much more democratic.
UC The rap scene.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,090
Within a year,
he won the British comedy award for best

43
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,924
newcomer his other characters bore at,
and Bruno were also making appearances 

44
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,620
at the time and they all seem to have 
the same kind of finger on the pulse,

45
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,100
confrontational satire that improves 
such a hit with allergy.

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,143
Sure enough,
20 years or hit movies and a major 

47
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:32,844
animation franchise.
Later Cohen is back with his patented 

48
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,510
brand of character comedy in who is 
America Auggie's.

49
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,143
No,
they all artificial prosthetics 

50
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:47,090
specially designed.
They look just like my real aunts,

51
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,550
but his style of pissing off suits 
didn't just appear overnight.

52
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,860
Cohen had training from a surprising 
place in the mid Nineties Cohen,

53
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:58,150
it's ended and elite clown school in 
Paris called Ecole Phillipe Galley.

54
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:58,984
Yay.
All right.

55
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,810
It's not technically a clown school.
It's a performing art school,

56
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,644
but it is run by master clown,
Felipe golly eight who was a pupil of 

57
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,634
famous,
my member formers shock McCook who 

58
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,590
followed in the footsteps of classics 
and mccloud's like Laurel and hardy,

59
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,830
Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.
But before you start asking,

60
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,690
where am I?
Oversized novelty shoes,

61
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,050
clowns are more than just red wigs and 
honky noses.

62
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,003
They have a pretty complicated history 
that can help explain how we landed 

63
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:24,860
here.

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,693
Just remember to point puppy pistols 
mouth right at the middle of the bad 

65
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,490
man.
If he has a big fat tummy pointed that

66
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,880
good.
Hey,

67
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,120
it's fine.
Way Back in 16th century Italy,

68
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,983
a type of traveling theater developed 
called commedia Dell'arte that was 

69
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,690
performed on the back of a wagon by 
actors in masks,

70
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,900
which already seems creepy enough even 
for clowns.

71
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,093
Commedia Dell'arte took the form of 
sketches and Improv with an elaborate 

72
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
bit of slap stick performed in the 
middle by a character called the 

73
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,940
Harlequin.
Well,

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,833
sorta like her.
The harlequin wore a checkered costume 

75
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:58,984
and acted in silence mostly so the 
actors didn't have to translate for the 

76
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:02,914
different Italian dialects.
This section of the performance came to 

77
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,710
be known as the pantomime.
By the 17th century.

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,610
Pantomimes were a whole show in 
contained a section called the Harlequin

79
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,444
aid,
which introduced the character called 

80
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,903
the clown.
The clown was created as a buffoonish 

81
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,234
companion to the Harlequin.
Their physical comedy left a trail of 

82
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,894
destruction behind them,
a kind of humor that we see everywhere 

83
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,314
around us today.
They were also borish and crude 

84
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,730
Chrisman,
Nan's boyfriend and Derek Ima was telman

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,573
then that is kind of bilingual.
How many languages does that mean him 

86
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:41,140
speak and the word clown originally 
meant rustic or peasant,

87
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,040
meaning they were used as a depiction of
the lowest class in society.

88
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,750
Okay,
is my neighbor symptoms.

89
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,960
He is barely my ass holes.
I get the window from a glass.

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,910
It wasn't good.
The window from a glass.

91
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,823
These broader comedy moments of Cohen's 
characters certainly seem to live up to 

92
00:04:57,891 --> 00:05:01,100
this classical definition of a clown,
but in those examples,

93
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,023
the clown is the one being laughed at.
Cohen's humor is unique and that it 

94
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:08,990
often turns the tables and gets the 
audience laughing at say,

95
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,100
a Georgia state Rep.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,073
How touch with Webex.
I'll catch you going to dropped the gun 

97
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,883
her,
I'll check you.

98
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,793
Well,
there's a theatrical tradition to that 

99
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:17,564
too.
One that is inextricably linked to 

100
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,590
clowned him,
the full building off commedia,

101
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,424
Dell'Arte Shakespeare.
It's always can shakespeare develop the 

102
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:28,250
full character in his place,
which was a mix of court,

103
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:31,970
Jester and clown,
even occasionally called them clowns and

104
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:32,804
while they were certainly comic relief,
there are other main role was to speak 

105
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,554
truth to power.
The fool and Shakespeare tends to hang 

106
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,870
around the important nobles and in the 
process of getting the laugh,

107
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,823
they often unexpectedly have something 
profound to say and if they can say 

108
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,270
whatever,
no one else can,

109
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,060
it's because everyone discounts them as 
an idiot.

110
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,940
Do you think president trump,
he's your friend,

111
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:55,250
do you think he might've had a golden 
shower?

112
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,230
Would surprise me.
For example,

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,273
Shakespeare's comedy 12th night,
the character Fesa is often called a 

114
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:05,390
wise fool because he sums up the play's 
themes and gives an honest assessment of

115
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,430
the situation when the other characters 
don't.

116
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,620
For instance,
when he's asked to sing,

117
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,543
instead of just performing the 
shakespearian equivalent of deaths 

118
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,164
Pasito,
he sings a song that explicitly states 

119
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:18,860
the place themes of young love.
It's haste and it's follows.

120
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,803
Another important element of the fool is
that they're foolish just springs out 

121
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:30,720
the stupidity in those around them.
In a midsummer night's dream,

122
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,330
the full character appropriately called 
bottom,

123
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,960
has his head literally turned into an 
ass without realizing it.

124
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,180
Yeah.
Shakespeare wasn't always subtle.

125
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,223
This is to make an ass of me.
He's then left to wander the forest 

126
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,950
where he meets the fairy Queen Titanium 
who under the influence of a love potion

127
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,903
falls in love with him,
asked hedanol bottom remains unaware of 

128
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:54,804
his condition.
So entertains titanium is misguided 

129
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,074
affection,
which allows the audience to literally 

130
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:00,744
laughed their asses off bottom.
Just like allergy or bore at isn't 

131
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:07,320
mocking titanium.
He's just an innocent fool.

132
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,430
It's titanium that makes an ass of 
herself similar to bottom,

133
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,264
making an ass of titanium by being an 
ass g uses his own ass street to bring 

134
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,270
out the ass in everyone around him.

135
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,260
Wouldn't it be more better instead of 
having a vote in age,

136
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,610
just saying,
all right,

137
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,980
if you as go cubes,
you can vote.

138
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,750
Uh,
I,

139
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,613
you know,
I,

140
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,860
I would be willing to try it.
And some,

141
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:30,880
a smaller way.

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,960
In an early Bruno clip,
Cohen interviews some of the coolest,

143
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:37,200
hippest and wealthiest fashion designers
at a fashion show,

144
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,490
one of whom has produced a line of 
trailer trash fashion for the catwalk.

145
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,503
Yes.
Literally like Mugatunes Dera leaked 

146
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:44,994
from zoo lander.
Bruno asks her about this line of 

147
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:50,100
clothes and prompts the stylist pete 
eight little too honest.

148
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,073
So 10 for Antonio Holmes says this,
watch trash trashing queer porter and 

149
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:57,920
where to buy as a cloud.
I don't think they can afford it.

150
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,523
Cohen is of course aware that they can,
asking at an upscale fashion show at 

151
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:07,400
poor people can buy the clothes on 
display is stupid,

152
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,470
but this stupidity is just a foil to get
them to reveal what Cohen already knows.

153
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,280
So you can see how Cohen takes this 
classical archetype of a clown taught to

154
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,440
him by Golly,
Aa and brought it up to date.

155
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,693
But besides foolishness,
the clown can also bring out people's a 

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,210
less than pleasant side too,
by incorporating a racial stereotype and

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,073
nationalism or sexuality.
A clown can reveal prejudices better 

158
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,294
than most.
So in four at sings and people sing 

159
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,724
along,
Cohen is baiting people's prejudices by 

160
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,370
mirroring them or when Bhorat does this,

161
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,330
every single man,
woman and child.

162
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,220
Yeah,
sure.

163
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,590
It's funny because we know he's being 
clown,

164
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,760
but it's all so depressingly revealing 
of public opinion during the Iraq war.

165
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,870
When Bruno and his partner make out and 
start undressing in the middle of a cage

166
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,390
fight,
we see the entire crowd doing this.

167
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,790
But if all Cohen is doing is making an 
ass of people,

168
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,320
what's the difference between him and an
Internet trolls?

169
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,680
Trolls tried to elicit a strong reaction
out of their audience.

170
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,960
Sure.
But they're all so hostile and negative.

171
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
The cloud,
on the other hand,

172
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,400
has no malicious intent.
They're just stupid.

173
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,750
A clown simply gives their targets,
enough rope to hang themselves with.

174
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,280
I didn't imply anybody here is racism 
costs,

175
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:39,120
not I'm racist toward Muslims,

176
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,080
but even then,
whatever deeper purpose of clown has,

177
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,050
it should always come second to making 
people laugh.

178
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,830
Obviously the first aim is to be as 
funny as you can,

179
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,500
but you know,
occasionally you,

180
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,693
you know,
we end up uncovering some unpleasant 

181
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:52,670
truths.

182
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,503
So why do we think of clowns only as 
white makeup wearing and poorly sized 

183
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,364
motor vehicle driving child scares.
What we picture when someone says clown 

184
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:02,504
today is known as the red cloud,
which was invented as a companion to be 

185
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:06,614
original white clown.
The red clown was created in the 19th 

186
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,500
century by actors and circus performers 
like Joseph Per Maldi,

187
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,280
Jordahl Fox and Tom belling who 
obviously weren't funny enough without a

188
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,114
red nose.
And that's the image that's taken over 

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,993
today,
whether it's used as an insult or to 

190
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:24,260
scare children.
Clowns have an image problem.

191
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,520
A lot of that art you Scalia is because 
we've forgotten what a clown actually is

192
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:31,430
and why clowns like Cohen are so 
important.

193
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,503
A clown isn't defined by his makeup,
which has always been a muddle of 

194
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,880
different influences anyway.
Golly,

195
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,650
eight once a student has discovered his 
clown,

196
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,360
he no longer announces with his outfit.
A clown doesn't need any of that stuff.

197
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,650
A clown is innocent.
This is what separates a real clown from

198
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,980
whatever the hell this is.
A clown should be invisible.

199
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,083
A clown can slip amongst any group,
particularly the people who think that 

200
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,410
they're powerful or successful.

201
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,950
You want to say big up yourself.
We'll trust board boot trust,

202
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,440
trust,
galley,

203
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,053
respect,

204
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,170
because the clown isn't seen as a 
threat.

205
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,540
That's how clowns draw out their 
qualities.

206
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,390
In these same people like selfishness,
foolishness,

207
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:16,360
childishness,
clumsiness and outright stupidity,

208
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,730
which is why someone like Cohen can get 
Pat Buchanan to admit that.

209
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,340
Is it ever worth fighting a war over 
sandwiches?

210
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,140
Is it ever worth fighting a war?
Um,

211
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,740
yes.
Or this in less than a month,

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,233
less than a month.
A first grader can become a first 

213
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,443
Grenada

214
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,000
low.
Yeah.

215
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:40,834
If you're watching who is America,
you're probably cringing along with me 

216
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:44,134
as Sasha tears apart.
Our current cultural nightmare these 

217
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,423
days.
It's easier and easier to face anxiety 

218
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:50,644
wherever you turn,
but luckily it's also easier than to 

219
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,244
find help to cope with it.
So this video is sponsored by better 

220
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,420
help.
The online counseling service.

221
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,523
I actually tried it myself,
spoke with a certified therapist named 

222
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,460
Jennifer,
and she was great.

223
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,070
She was professional,
firmly qualified,

224
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:10,180
and was as good or better than any 
therapist I've seen in real life.

225
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,560
My favorite things about better help our
one completely confidential too.

226
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,560
It removes the stigma of looking for 
help and three,

227
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,740
it can work around your schedule.
In the GIG economy,

228
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,130
it's almost impossible to dedicate 
yourself to a regular time slot,

229
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:27,700
but with better help you determine your 
own therapy scheduled.

230
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,070
You can communicate with the counselor 
via message,

231
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,510
live chat,
phone,

232
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,440
or video conferencing while you were in 
your pool playing with your dog.

233
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,830
Whatever is most productive for you.
It's super important that you're able to

234
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,580
find a mental health professional that 
works for you and with better helps,

235
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,443
huge network of licensed professionals.
It's easier than ever to start having 

236
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:50,380
productive counseling sessions that are 
convenient and accessible.

237
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,603
So if you're like me and you think you 
could benefit from speaking to someone 

238
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,840
on a regular basis,
checkout better.

240
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,360
And as always,
thanks for watching guys.

241
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,553
Peace.
