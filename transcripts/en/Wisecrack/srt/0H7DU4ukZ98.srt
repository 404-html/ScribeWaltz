1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,233
I'm Anne Marie slaughter and I am the 
dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of 

2
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,790
Public and international affairs at 
Princeton.

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,280
United States has to operate on two 
tracks in the world.

4
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,670
One is addressing the crises that were 
already in the wars that were already in

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,590
a,
the mistakes we've made.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,633
So closing Guantanamo,
signing back up to the Geneva 

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,280
Conventions for all Americans.
That's one agenda.

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,230
And that agenda is right there and it's 
on the president's desk and he,

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,073
you know,
he has to deal with it and the global 

10
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,414
financial crisis on top of that.
So that's one track and the president 

11
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,374
has to be addressing those issues.
But at the same time there has to be a 

12
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,244
longer term plan just like in a 
corporation where you are investing for 

13
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,690
the future where the president says,
all right,

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,810
you know,
over the next two years,

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,790
five years,
10 years,

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,810
20 years.

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,643
Here's our,
my vision of how America is going to 

18
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,754
operate in the global economy,
in a global polity and increasingly 

19
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,804
global society.
We are going to exploit the connections 

20
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,060
we've already got.
We're going to build them.

21
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:30,000
We are going to understand that our 
immigrants in many ways are our greatest

22
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,450
assets.
We are going to lead in a different way.

23
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,760
Where as I talked about strategic 
leadership,

24
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:39,180
we're going to understand that partners 
are terrific.

25
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,103
You know,
we want partners in every region and we 

26
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:44,970
want those partners to take the lead 
where they can.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,030
Now they're going to be places where 
only we can do it and then we have to be

28
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:48,864
there.
But it's a vision of the United States 

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,290
at the center of a global web connected,
uh,

30
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,110
taking in the best ideas from all over 
the world,

31
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:02,190
but sending them out whether those are 
ideas on foreign policy or on innovation

32
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,024
and products or on green technology,
which ought to be a huge part of what 

33
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:06,774
we're doing.

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,630
It's a vision of the United States that 
says,

35
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,464
you know,
we're reinventing ourselves as a great 

36
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,590
power.
One more time.

37
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,110
We started as a weak power.
We rose,

38
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:16,944
but we weren't really an imperial power.
We were a new kind of superpower in the 

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,760
20th century.
We created all these institutions.

40
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:27,330
We actually cooperated with most other 
nations around the world.

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,130
Now we're going to invent ourselves 
again,

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,250
and we're going to invent ourselves for 
a networked world.

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,640
We're going to keep our army.
We do need our military,

44
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,310
and we do have the ability to send 
troops around the world,

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,580
but we're going to understand that that 
is a small part of the game and probably

46
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:48,390
a diminishing part of the game in terms 
of the utility of military force,

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,420
and we just like where the country that 
invented the Internet,

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,450
we're going to invent how you lead in a 
completely network

49
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,150
[inaudible].

50
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,343
Yeah.
