1
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,863
I believe in the power of conversation 
to get human beings to converge on a 

2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,620
common project in which in which people 
can collaborate in an open ended way,

3
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,550
in a non divisive way,
in a way that that never requires a,

4
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:29,740
an appeal to violence.
And,

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,023
and we have that in science.
We have that in much of intellectual 

6
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:35,404
discourse.
We very much don't have that in 

7
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,314
religion.
It's just there's nothing that a 

8
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:40,534
fundamentalist Christian and a 
fundamentalist Muslim can say to one 

9
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,170
another to put their beliefs on the 
table for,

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,370
for revision.
I mean they,

11
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,050
this is what dogmatism is.
It is,

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,913
it is a willingness to believe things 
for bad reasons and an unwillingness to 

13
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,500
have your rather tenuous reasons 
challenged.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,150
I mean,
it's,

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,780
you,
you're,

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,320
you were saying,
I believe this.

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,630
No matter what anyone else says.
So that's,

18
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,270
that's the antithesis of conversation.

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,150
It really is a,
a conversation stopper.

20
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,280
And so that's,
um,

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,860
that's why I paint a very stark 
difference between faith and reason.

22
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:19,780
I mean,
reason if you're a reasonable,

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,040
if you're interested in how the world 
works and what is true altogether,

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,980
you are open,
you're by definition open to,

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,280
to further conversation,
to more argument,

26
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,670
to more evidence and your,
you're in fact interested to find out if

27
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,060
you're mistaken about anything,
if you are not predisposed to that,

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,860
that open ended conversation.
Um,

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,393
you really have,
you have rendered yourself immune to 

30
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:49,780
influence from the world that influenced
apart from just having someone,

31
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,150
you know,
pull out the guns on you.

32
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:52,984
I mean,
so there are certain people because of 

33
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,990
their dogmatism who have made themselves
impossible to talk to.

34
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,960
I mean there's nothing that you're going
to say to,

35
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:01,794
to,
to get a Sama bin Ladin to reconsider 

36
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:04,360
his view of the world.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,453
And it's a unique feature of religion 
that we defend this mode of being in a 

38
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,160
religious context in a way that we would
never tolerate it in another context.

39
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:15,530
I mean,
if you're,

40
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,290
if somebody has medical beliefs,
you know,

41
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,400
if your,
if your doctor says,

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
you know,
I know this,

43
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,920
this,
this cures cancer,

44
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:24,010
but you know,
I'm not going to tell you how or why or,

45
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:24,940
or um,
you know,

46
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,650
I'm not going to have my data 
challenged.

47
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:27,030
I mean,
this is,

48
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,930
that's a mode of talk within a medical 
context that you would never get through

49
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:34,460
medical school,
appealing to those kinds of,

50
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,323
of,
uh,

51
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,840
intuitions.
Um,

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,753
it,
that really is the core of faith based 

53
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,174
religion.
This idea that there are certain things 

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,773
like that.
The Bible is the perfect word of God or 

55
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,140
the Koran or the perfect word of God 
that just have to be accepted,

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,470
cannot be challenged.
Uh,

57
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,930
and in certain context,
certainly within the Muslim world,

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,930
you can die for calling those 
certainties into.

59
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
I mean,
it literally is a capital offense to 

60
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,503
wonder whether the Koran may not be the 
perfect word of the creator of the 

61
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,580
universe.
I mean,

62
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,414
it's just,
and it used to be a killing a fence 

63
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,240
within Christianity.
It's just,

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,290
it's just we have moderated the western 
religion,

65
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Judaism and Christianity to a remarkable
degree because of the last 200 years of,

66
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,490
of scientific and political problem.
