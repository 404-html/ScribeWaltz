1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,790
That was the vision of literature for 
six a all the time.

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,093
Uh,
I don't think I'm a very exceptional 

3
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:19,334
case because simply in our daily life we
approached sex either as a pleasure or 

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,370
as a tool,
uh,

5
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,150
for literature six,
uh,

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,970
that would say even I don't like very 
much the term six.

7
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,980
I would say the physical relation,
right.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,450
Then the physical relationship between,
I mean,

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
between two partners are in lethbridge 
means much more because you need sex not

10
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,960
only for pleasure,
sometimes you need,

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,831
uh,
to,

12
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:54,200
to,
to perform a physical relation with your

13
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:59,201
partner because you are scared or 
because you are disparate or because you

14
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:05,240
are looking for intimacy or because you 
want to be protected by a mother,

15
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,180
for example,
a order,

16
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,014
uh,
you would like to discover your partner 

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,680
or to take control many things.
And this is a very rich human domain.

18
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,100
Accordingly,
it's a very rich,

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,990
uh,
later in the field.

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,943
I mean,
you cannot ignore sexual physical 

21
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:28,170
relation.
Literature is many things more than just

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,880
the pleasure you see or you achieved the
pleasure through many,

23
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,500
many roads.
You see,

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,660
uh,
it is,

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,750
it is an art.
It is a way to express yourself.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,120
It is even a way to discover the world.
It is a way to discover your partner.

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,983
I don't think that you know really your 
partner without having sex with him or 

28
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,050
with her.
You see,

29
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,520
because this is one,
it's a moment of truth.

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,653
You see,
and you could discover your feelings 

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,570
after having the physical relation much 
better than before.

32
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,003
You see what is left.
You see in the few seconds after the 

33
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,010
pleasure,
the physical pleasure,

34
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,810
then you discover exactly how much you 
feel for this person.

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,310
You see,
it's very,

36
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:22,790
very mysterious and reach moment and 
accordingly.

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,690
It's a big challenge for a fixture.
