Jared,

4
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:09,420
again,
we saw your request.

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,254
So today we're putting the crazy hat 
back on to dive into the philosophy of 

6
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:14,234
grant Morrison.
Writer of such a claimed works as also 

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,300
our superman flex men,
tallow and multiversity like Alan Moore.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,253
Greg Morrison was part of the British 
invasion that revolutionized comics in 

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,274
the 80s and also like more,
he's a self proclaimed magician with an 

10
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:30,560
affinity for psychotropic drugs.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,493
To me it just comes in a very simple 
equation is that wife plus significance 

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,410
equals magic.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,530
But there are major differences between 
them beyond their obvious discrepancy in

14
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:45,580
haircut philosophy,
as insane as more seems Morrison,

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,290
Mike be even crazier.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,283
Wow.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,263
He wrote some fictional girlfriends for 
a fictional version of himself in the 

18
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,630
invisibles and then later claimed that 
they appeared in real life.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,980
So as a result of this,
I just split up with my girlfriend and a

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,510
silky.
I want a new one.

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,530
Want it to look exactly like this,
check in the karmic cause she's cool.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,550
So I did,
I said to him a monthly they oh tons up.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,673
Then another one.

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
And when he wrote about this fictional 
grant,

25
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,474
morrison being attacked by bacterial,
God's a demonic attack and or staph 

26
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,440
infection brought real life grant 
morrison to death's doorstep

27
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,443
a that if a,
if a pea coat to through the situation 

28
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:28,014
where he's been taught to what his lungs
had bust and they've just been held in 

29
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,420
captivity and subject until these awful 
things,

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,420
the months late and I'm in hospital,
two bus,

31
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,420
lungs dying of blood poisoning and 
facing exactly the same shamonic trial,

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,520
put my character through

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,120
Ben Christ appeared to him after which 
he was healed and gain the superpower to

34
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:47,954
cure cancer in cats.
But all of that pales in comparison to 

35
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:52,880
his experience in Katmandu.

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,730
It'd been abducted by aliens and count 
mine in 1994

37
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,743
where he was abducted by rippling 
dripping blobs of pure holographic 

38
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
metamaterial angels and brought to a 
mega medium in which entire universes 

39
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,770
are suspended and shown the nature of 
reality.

40
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,450
Allegedly it was like a Burrito of 
religious revelation and alien abduction

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,313
all rolled into one.
Whether he actually ascended to a 

42
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:19,230
heavenly hyperspace or was just tripping
balls is beside the point.

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,800
There's a surprising amount of 
sober-minded philosophy and physics that

44
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,370
seem to agree with certain aspects of 
Morrison's Katmandu experience,

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,233
including why he believes that the 
universe is essentially just a giant 

46
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:30,744
comic book and how he's the midwife to 
an incredible future wherein we become 

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,500
God.
Welcome to this wisecrack edition on the

48
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,334
philosophy of grant Morrison spoilers 
ahead and if you want to dive even 

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,900
deeper into the mind of this mad genius,
join us over@wisecrackplus.com

50
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,320
for an hour long podcast interview with 
the creators of this video.

51
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,470
To be clear,
Morrison is not suggesting we could ever

52
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,380
become the capital g God described in 
the Bible,

53
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,180
Torah or the Quran.
You know,

54
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:01,780
a single almighty creator of all things.
When comic writers use the Word God,

55
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,010
it's more often with a lowercase g like 
the north stady turned marvel hero,

56
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:06,844
thor or other immensely powerful beings 
with this logic morrison regards of the 

57
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,243
Justice League as the Pantheon of 
American mythology and deliberately 

58
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,740
structured his roster in Jla two 
parallel there,

59
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,574
Olympian counterparts.
Now we want to be very specific in 

60
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,874
saying that he doesn't merely mean 
humans will become super power post 

61
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,790
humans one day.
He means something much more.

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
It's Captain Adam who,
uh,

63
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,843
inspired Moore's doctor Manhattan that 
gives us our first hint as to what 

64
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,714
Morrison means by God.
Both captain Adam and doctor Manhattan 

65
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,480
achieved God's status because of their 
view of time.

66
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,870
They experience every event in their 
lives simultaneously.

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,973
It's not that they have perfect recall 
of the past and total knowledge of the 

68
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,710
future for them.
There is no pastor future.

69
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,320
Instead,
every single moment is equally,

70
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,154
eternally real.
Picture a film reel as it rolls forward 

71
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,874
at 24 frames per second.
The light projects one image on the 

72
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,920
screen at any given moment.
In this analogy,

73
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,910
the screen is reality and only that 
single frame is real,

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,893
uh,
frame pops into existence as the 

75
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,680
projector illuminates it and pops out of
existence.

76
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,514
As we move on to the next frame,
this is what philosopher jme mctaggart 

77
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,443
calls the theory of time.
It's how we as humans perceive time 

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,093
mactaggarts be theory.
On the other hand is that events do not 

79
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,694
have objective tents.
So imagine if we were to eliminate each 

80
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:28,294
frame of the film reel all at once so 
that we could simultaneously gaze upon 

81
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,190
every single moment in the movie.

82
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,550
The main school of thought among be 
theorists is eternalism,

83
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,563
which claims every moment in time is 
eternal from the big bang to the heat 

84
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,184
death of the universe.
Nothing ever pops in or out of 

85
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,394
existence,
rather events exist alongside one 

86
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,454
another.
The shattering of this illusion is a 

87
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,094
frequent trope and morrison's writings 
in the invisibles Lord Fanny's 

88
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:58,060
initiation into magic is accomplished at
the age of 11 when the remainder of fan,

89
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:58,894
he's life getting raped and beaten and 
Rio drugged out in a drag club in 

90
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:02,944
London,
even eventually dying is experienced as 

91
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,094
if it already happened.
The Aztec Goddess Basil Tiotto reveals 

92
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:11,050
to Fanny.
Time is not a river.

93
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,600
Time is more like a bubble,
but is to a bubble.

94
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,480
What a bubble is to a circle drawn on 
the ground.

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,470
So Morrison philosophizes about the 
nature of time in his stories.

96
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,620
Cool,
right?

97
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,210
Well,
he takes it further.

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,073
Way further to Morrison.
A slightly more literal version of this 

99
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:26,944
be theory of time lies in the very 
medium of the comic book on any given 

100
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,980
page.
If you were to ask the heroes,

101
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,843
they tell us that page and that panel 
was the present moment so far as they 

102
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,434
could tell,
but as the reader we see that all the 

103
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,370
panels,
all the pages,

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
all the printed issues are all equally.
Now their time is an illusion,

105
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,341
but one,
two,

106
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,174
which we're not subjected.
Even the two dimensional flat piece of 

107
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:56,120
paper on which comics are drawn may be 
an apt analog for the structure of space

108
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:56,954
time per morrison.
Our universe may even all be a hologram 

109
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,064
projected onto a flat mega membrane 
which is in turn embedded along with 

110
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:08,150
many others like it within a higher 
dimensional space.

111
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,653
He's referring in his own way to the 
holographic principle per Stephen 

112
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,183
Hawking.
Information associated with all 

113
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:21,140
phenomenon in the three dimensional 
world can be stored on a two dimensional

114
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,390
boundary,
like a holographic image.

115
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,463
In a certain sense,
the world would be two dimensional like 

116
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,940
the pages of a comic book.
So far.

117
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,774
Everything Morrison said seems like a 
reasonable conclusion to draw from 

118
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,494
mainstream theoretical physics and if 
all he had to say was that just as a 

119
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,170
film reel is a fitting analogy for eight
theory.

120
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,980
So two is a comic book and Apt Analogy 
for the b theory of time,

121
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,470
his contribution would be entirely 
warranted,

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,210
but then the cat man to experience went 
down and things got weird.

123
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,680
Now,
although his more out,

124
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:55,190
their ideas don't necessarily hold up to
scientific scrutiny,

125
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,083
they're still worth exploring because 
they take comic books and superheroes 

126
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,210
stories and turn them into a compelling 
worldview whether warranted or not.

127
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,530
Many look to figures like superman and 
captain America for moral inspiration.

128
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,520
Morrison offers some justification for 
emulating fictional heroes,

129
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,383
treating them as gods and even go so far
as to say that the idea of superman is 

130
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,050
every bit as real as the idea of God and
suggest that we are even more super,

131
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,553
even more godlike.
It's for this reason that Morrison 

132
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:24,914
depicts philosopher Giovanni Pico de la 
mere and Dola in the pages of all star 

133
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:32,090
Superman delivering his famous oration 
on the dignity of man.

134
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,800
As he later said in his autobiography,
Pecos Oratoria is without a doubt urging

135
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:40,970
us to go far beyond the human into the 
realm of angels and Gods.

136
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,770
It asks us to accept the superhuman as 
an undeniable fact of our nature and the

137
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:48,230
goal of our future evolution as a 
people.

138
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,273
Although his metaphors are biblical,
suggesting Cherubs and Sarah F's and 

139
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,204
thrones as our role models and 
intermediaries on the road to God or 

140
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:56,864
cosmic consciousness,
we can just as easily call them 

141
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,630
superheroes.

142
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,823
So what happened at Kathmandu that made 
Morrison believe that the universe 

143
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,160
really is a comic book and that humanity
really is a superhero?

144
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,203
Well,
he claims to have stepped outside the 

145
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:12,890
multiverse and seeing reality from the 
outside,

146
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,880
the universe,
the entire space time continuum from big

147
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:17,714
bang to heat death,
no less was not a linear stream of 

148
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,610
events with beginning,
middle and end.

149
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,100
That was only how it felt from the 
inside.

150
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,083
All Life on earth was one thing,
a single weird anemone like mega hydro 

151
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,330
with its single celled and mortal route 
in precambrian tides,

152
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,740
a slowly complexifying,
increasingly self aware super organism.

153
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,600
It was all of us all life as seen from 
the perspective of a higher dimension,

154
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,173
whereas eternalism his content to 
conclude that spacetime is a timeless 

155
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,464
four dimensional object.
Morrison goes beyond eternal wisdom by 

156
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,214
claiming that by the same principle 
every human being is actually a mere 

157
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:03,270
sell in a single super organism that is 
humanity.

158
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,960
And therefore if each one of us is part 
of a larger hole,

159
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,050
then all truism and beneficence and 
charity are in our own self interest.

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,553
The simplistic divide of right and wrong
and good and evil and superhero comics 

161
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,723
suddenly seems less silly because our 
morals aren't arbitrary social 

162
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,984
constructs.
They're the genetic programming 

163
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,480
instructing this super organism not to 
destroy itself.

164
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,553
Indeed,
this view as a basis for ethics is the 

165
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,434
very conclusion lex luthor reaches when 
he gains Superman's powers and upon 

166
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:35,964
seeing with his super senses all of the 
fundamental forces and how they're 

167
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,740
interconnected,
he begins to weep.

168
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,933
This is how he sees all the time every 
day like it's all just us in here 

169
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:49,260
together and we're all we've got,
okay,

170
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,320
so if humanity as a whole is like a 
superhero comic book,

171
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,800
we should therefore behave like these 
costume do gooders.

172
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,530
It's a compelling case,
but if you think that's weird,

173
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,650
he also saw fifth dimensional aliens or 
what he called mercurial,

174
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,593
hyper sprites,
five dimensional intelligence as could 

175
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,090
as a condition of their geometrically 
elevated position.

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,953
Get into our skulls quite easily and we 
could expect their voices to come from 

177
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:14,604
inside.
They in turn could hear our thoughts as 

178
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,900
easily as we can read Batman's private 
inner monologues on a two d page.

179
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,740
This is illustrated in multiversity,
Pax Americana Number One,

180
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,490
while reading a comic book Captain Adam 
uses to two scientists.

181
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,443
The stories linear,
but I can flip through the pages in any 

182
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:35,400
order,
any direction forward in time.

183
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,860
To the conclusion,
back to the opening scene,

184
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,530
the characters remained unaware of my 
scrutiny,

185
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
but their thoughts are transparent,
weightless and little clouds.

186
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,250
This is how a two dimensional continuum 
looks to you.

187
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,560
Then staring straight ahead.
He says,

188
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,470
imagine how your three d world appears 
to me.

189
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,723
Adam's fourth wall break brings us to 
another major theme in Morrison's Works 

190
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,743
Meta fiction Alec,
which is the exploration of the 

191
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,054
relationship between the fiction itself 
with the real world of the writer and 

192
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,584
reader Morrison first wrestled with 
[inaudible] in the final issue of his 

193
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:12,210
run on animal man in which he dawned 
what he calls a fiction suit.

194
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,190
He inserts himself into the comic itself
to interact with the character he notes.

195
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,113
I explained to my character how the 
people who wrote his life needed drama 

196
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,210
and shock and violence to make his story
interesting.

197
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,193
The implication was that our own lives 
may be written to entertain or to 

198
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,930
instruct an audience in a perpendicular 
direction.

199
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:35,370
We could never point to interacting with
us in ways we could scarcely understand,

200
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,233
but that could be divided in the 
relationship of the comic world to the 

201
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:39,954
world of the Creator and audience.
This is the crux that connects 

202
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,540
Morrison's metta fiction to his musings 
on spacetime.

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,810
If comic books reflect the nature of our
universe,

204
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,673
can we say that the physical comic like 
universe reflects the nature of some 

205
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,154
higher reality?
Who are our cosmic comic creators who 

206
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,070
writes the plotlines of history,
pencils,

207
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,750
the particle interactions,
letters,

208
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,700
the thought balloons of intelligent 
minds?

209
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,743
Morrison's answer is the fifth 
dimensional aliens that we cannot grasp 

210
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,794
with our feeble three dimensional mines,
but he admits the particulars are less 

211
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:12,424
important than the implications that 
follow from there being intelligent 

212
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:15,904
designers.
If the analogy of our universe being 

213
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,544
like a comic book extends so far as to 
suggest that it has something like a 

214
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,204
writer,
then the mere fact that it is a written 

215
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,610
work implies a purposefulness to our 
existence.

216
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,631
Now,
of course,

217
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,720
being created doesn't necessarily in 
part dignity,

218
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,733
we might be like morrisons animal man 
with all our suffering for no greater 

219
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:38,860
purpose can to provide drama in a piece 
of cheap entertainment.

220
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,873
We might be made by a hack.
Our whole purpose might be to pass 

221
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:44,650
butter,
but contra his younger self.

222
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:45,484
When writing animal man,
the more mature Morrison became more 

223
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:51,610
optimistic in flex men,
tallow man of muscle mystery.

224
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,110
Morrison once again used [inaudible] as 
a means of exploring questions about our

225
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:56,944
own purpose.

226
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,963
Just as Morrison sees,
reality is having a three tiered 

227
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,770
structure with his fifth dimensional 
emcee at the top,

228
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,940
the two d comic book characters at the 
bottom and us in the middle.

229
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,800
So two is the story of flexpen tallow 
set across three levels of reality.

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,170
There's the cartoon world of Flex 
Metallo.

231
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,570
The realistic world of Flexes Writer 
Wall is sage and Avatar,

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,433
Morrison himself,
and yet a higher reality inhabited by 

233
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:27,190
superheroes more real than they're 
writers or the fifth dimensional aliens.

234
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,550
In the story,
it's revealed that superheroes,

235
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,630
instead of being merely a product of the
imagination of writers like wally,

236
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,613
were in fact the beings that created 
wally's entire world after which they 

237
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,174
retreated in the imagination,
seeding our culture with superhero 

238
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:43,834
stories in anticipation of the day that 
mere mortals are ready to become like 

239
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:48,940
them.
As a result,

240
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,690
humanity only needs to resolve their 
uncertainty about whether superheros are

241
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:53,524
real or not,
and decide to believe them into 

242
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:56,254
existence here,
Morrison to suggesting a much more 

243
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:00,190
dignified purpose to our existence.

244
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,113
We're meant to discover our fundamental 
purpose in the pages of comic books and 

245
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:05,704
to believe into existence.
The idea of the superman to incarnate 

246
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:09,964
him in ourselves for Morrison,
the medium of comics and the plot 

247
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:17,530
structure of superhero stories are so 
closely connected in our culture because

248
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:22,060
both are parts of the same pattern that 
explained everything else in existence.

249
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,080
In recognizing this pattern,
Morrison writes his own autobiography,

250
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:30,550
Super Gods in the style and structure of
an archetypical superhero story,

251
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,000
including a secret origin in Glasgow,
the call to adventure,

252
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:34,834
a top Katmandu and a death and rebirth 
in which he brings the hidden knowledge 

253
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:41,350
he gained on his hero's journey to the 
comics community,

254
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,543
and while that hidden knowledge is 
parsed out in piecemeal and his comics 

255
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:45,964
writing,
it's in super gods where he's most 

256
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:52,010
explicit about just what makes humankind
itself a Super God.

257
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,083
Already we can see humankind is having 
all the attributes of comic book 

258
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,190
superheroes or even Pagan Gods.

259
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,880
Whereas mercury carried messages at the 
speed of thought to the Roman gods.

260
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,150
We have instantaneous interconnectivity 
via the internet,

261
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,103
whereas heme dolls all seeing I could 
spy everywhere in all nine realms are 

262
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:13,370
satellites can zoom in on any spot on 
earth like superman.

263
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,204
We flown faster than a speeding bullet.
Humanity when viewed as a whole is 

264
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:18,854
already a super God insofar as there is 
no future frames of the film reel 

265
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,420
popping into existence.
We are not becoming the Super God.

266
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,190
We already always are.
This epic of human history is merely its

267
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:35,210
secret origin story as to how it gets 
it's superhuman powers,

268
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,133
but all of its ongoing adventures and 
never ending battles to come are all 

269
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,390
already written,
published,

270
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,224
printed,
and on the shelves of some higher 

271
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:44,744
dimensional comic shop.
If mankind is this super organism with 

272
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:48,944
all these stupendous powers who supposed
to act according to the simple morality 

273
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,173
of a superhero whose whole history is 
structured like a superhero story and 

274
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:00,110
who's living in a cosmos that's 
constructed like a comic book,

275
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,810
then Morrison's obvious conclusion is 
this.

276
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,930
Mankind's purpose is to be a superhero.
It's for this reason that Morrison calls

277
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:08,864
the Sun God from Smallville,
our greatest ever idea as the human 

278
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:12,974
species.
Not because superman was the prototype 

279
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,910
on which all other superheroes would be 
based,

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,760
but because he is the template for which
these Super God,

281
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:24,761
if humanity must become all powerful and
all good all at the same time.

282
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,600
This is the summation of Morrison's 
philosophy articulated Bestbuy Jarell to

283
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:30,434
his one and only son regarding the 
essential truth about man and superman 

284
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,210
and not the mankind within the comics,
but the mankind reading comics.

285
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,290
You have given them an ideal to aspire 
to embodied their highest aspirations.

286
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,203
They will race and stumble and fall and 
crawl and curse and finally they will 

287
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:52,070
join you in the Sun Palau,
but hey,

288
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:52,904
whether or not we accomplish wonders,
the doctors who work with hymns have 

289
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,660
come pretty close.

290
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,643
Hims has created a personalized and 
private online store for men to get 

291
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,154
recommendations from real doctors for 
FDA approved prescription and 

292
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,650
nonprescription products without leaving
home.

293
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,630
What kind of products you ask?
Well,

294
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:09,464
look guys,
some things are difficult to discuss 

295
