1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,060
I think there has to be some evolution 
to the curriculum.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,140
Um,
but I'm,

3
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,180
I'm fairly old fashioned and then I,
you know,

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,043
I like to teach basic math skills and I 
feel that in order to really master 

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,350
skills,
you have to practice them.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,270
Uh,
so,

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,520
um,
um,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,980
I may not be the most innovative teacher
in America,

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,780
but,
um,

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,453
mmm.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,320
I think,
you know,

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,710
I keep coming back to the standards that
we have.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,810
Every teacher has his or her own skills 
and,

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,400
um,
um,

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,680
preferences in terms of how to teach.
But I think,

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,880
you know,
we,

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,790
we have to make sure that we,
we learned the basics.

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,550
Um,
and,

19
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:00,750
um,
you know,

20
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,970
I,
one of the things I believe that happens

21
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,804
in education is that we,
we tend to latch onto the latest reform 

22
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,820
idea.
Uh,

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,080
I,
I would call it the reform do shore.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,380
And I would suggest most of these reform
movements that we have,

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,300
we've tried before they're recycled with
a new name slapped on them.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,320
Okay.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,153
So I'm not a big fan of new reform ideas
and thinking that those reform efforts 

28
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:40,660
are silver bullets.
I just don't think this happens.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,540
Um,
instead,

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,650
I believe that it's the teacher who 
makes the difference.

31
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,860
So if it's a question of a program,

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,900
she's a person.
To me,

33
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:56,830
it's the person that is far more 
important than the program.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,790
The.
