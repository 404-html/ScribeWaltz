1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
This video is brought to you by verve.
Hey,

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,333
wise crack Helen here.
So jarrod's taking a breather this 

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,843
month,
which means I have the honor of telling 

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,824
you guys all about one of the most 
beloved and Van Request An enemies in 

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,680
wise crack history.
Cowboy Bebop,

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,900
yes,
we're finally doing it.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,900
So what's taken us so long?
Well,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,763
when we sat down to analyze what makes 
cowboy bebop stow amazing from it's 

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,500
super fluid fight scenes too,
it's insane.

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:36,501
Grab bag of a soundtrack.
We kept running into the same problem.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,010
Every episode is a kaleidoscope of 
references,

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,960
philosophies,
narratives and forms.

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,350
It seems downright impossible to pull on
just one thread.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,430
Then around the beginning of season two 
we noticed this interstitial,

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,140
yeah,
it might be hard to read,

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,770
but it says then in 2071 in the 
universe,

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,740
the bounty hunters who are gathering in 
spaceship Bebop,

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,680
we'll play freely without fear of risky 
things.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,090
They must create new dreams and films by
breaking traditional styles.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,680
The work which becomes a new genre 
itself will be called Cowboy bebop.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,940
If those last two sentences about 
breaking traditional styles and creating

22
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,730
a new genre that really gave us pause.
See,

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,240
cowboy bebop isn't just about great 
characters and deep thoughts.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,420
It's about blurring the line between 
three distinct genres,

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,820
Saifai,
westerns and no arm.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,060
So welcome to this wise crack addition 
on cowboy bebop and you guessed it,

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,890
spoilers ahead.
And thanks again to our sponsor.

28

Anamae science fiction and so much more.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,730
If you're a cowboy bebop fan,
be sure to check out their new show,

30
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,750

space fix for a free 30 day trial,

go to [inaudible] dot com slash wise 
crack.

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,373
Now back to the show.
First a quick refresher course set in 

33
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,304
the year 2071 cowboy bebop follows a 
group of starving bounty hunters who 

34
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,270
wonder from planet to planet looking for
their next meal ticket.

35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,403
There's jet,
a former detective who's rocking the 

36
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:03,744
robocop look on his left arm spike,
a modern take on the Marlboro man mixed 

37
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:10,450
with the tragic mob back story.
They authentic,

38
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:14,460
they tall dealing with gambling problems
and a serious case of Amnesia.

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,740
And,
um,

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,640
ed,
who's a brilliant hacker.

41
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,810
But really,
yeah,

42
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:22,140
she's just it together in more or less 
episodic fashion.

43
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,063
The team hunts down fugitives while 
shoveling down some pretty meager meals 

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,580
aside from an ongoing fight with hunger.
The first thread you'll notice in cowboy

45
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:38,280
bebop is its unique take on the side by 
genre.

46
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,293
The show challenges our idea of Scifi,
but presenting a future that doesn't 

47
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,310
really have much to do with the future.
Sure.

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,163
There are all the familiar trappings 
here after the destruction of a giant 

49
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,414
space portal that lets you travel the 
universe at and your lightspeed earth 

50
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:51,864
has been left near uninhabitable and 
mankind has spread throughout the 

51
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:55,764
universe.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,290
And for those of you who grew up on 
things like star wars or Gundam Wing,

53
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,880
you'll notice a medley of conventions,
epic space battles check terrifying,

54
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,360
mysterious alien creatures.
Check space terrorist.

55
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,373
Sure why not.
But the longer you inhabit the world of 

56
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,600
Cowboy Bebop,
the more you realize it's brand of Scifi

57
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,210
isn't about portraying the future.
In fact,

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,073
it feels more like the 90s and it does 
2071 cities here aren't the shining 

59
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,260
beacons on the hill.
That future is and promised us.

60
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,720
Instead they're dirty,
almost run down.

61
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,763
Hell.
There's a whole space colony full of 

62
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,950
drifters and riff raff and technology 
isn't exactly 70 years ahead of its time

63
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,320
either.
Take session seven for example,

64
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,183
heavy metal queen in it,
we see the ins and outs of space 

65
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,130
transportation through the lens of the 
best truck or there is the tea,

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,910
but it quickly becomes apparent that 
much hasn't changed for future trucking.

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,490
Space trucks are still adorned with hood
ornaments.

68
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,390
Their cabins are still cramps to cedars 
crammed with personal knickknacks.

69
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,373
They even communicate via radio add 
though on La [inaudible] whole new 

70
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,650
[inaudible] radio people and when it's 
time to wind down there,

71
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:04,464
relax at crappy rest stops,
which look identical to the ones I've 

72
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,340
seen in west Tennessee.
So what's going on here?

73
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,383
What are we to make of Psi Phi that 
doesn't really make use of the science 

74
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:17,650
part in a flashier way as wise crack 
favorite ray Bradbury tells us,

75
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,920
science fiction is the fiction of 
revolutions.

76
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,230
Revolutions in time,
space,

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,270
medicine,
travel and thought.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,433
Above all,
science fiction is the fiction of warm 

79
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,674
blooded human men and women sometimes 
elevated and sometimes crushed by their 

80
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,170
machines.
In other words,

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,550
at the heart of any good Saifai story 
then are the people and their stories in

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,220
which machines are only apart 
Bradbury's.

83
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,720
Words go a long way in explaining why we
continually see stories and cowboy bebop

84
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,810
that are surprisingly light on the 
technology that surrounds them.

85
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,470
Perhaps there's no better example of 
this then Fay Valentine.

86
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,890
In many ways,
Faye is a victim of sciences progress.

87
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,950
When she and her family traveled to 
space aboard their private shuttle,

88
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,843
something goes horribly wrong.
Leaving Fay as the only survivor about 

89
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:07,680
her injuries are so severe,
the doctors decide to cryogenically free

90
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,570
sir until she can be saved by later 
medical advancements.

91
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,613
Over 50 years pass and Faye is awoken by
the questionably named physician doctor 

92
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:18,390
Baucus except there's only one problem.
Dallas.

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,200
It they all had to go to dona.
Yup.

94
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,490
She lost her memory worse because the 
gate exploded while she was frozen.

95
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,430
There's no surviving data on who fay 
even was before.

96
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,653
Id this,
what are the juvenile machine 

97
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,700
[inaudible]

98
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,230
and did we mention she's now drowning in
debt checky had I not done yet.

99
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,760
Despite science and technology nearly 
screwing Fay at every turn,

100
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,653
they story is never folded into a 
warning about the future or it's 

101
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:02,954
technology instead.
Phase journey is all about finding a 

102
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,854
place to belong,
a pretty common literary trope across 

103
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:14,111
all genres at the sea.
[inaudible] yeah,

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,680
two button.
Sure.

105
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,170
Elements of science fiction setup,
phase narrative,

106
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,183
but at the end of the day they're just 
silent cues that help move the conflict 

107
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,460
along by letting science elements do 
their work in the background.

108
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,700
Cowboy bebop really thrust its 
characters into the spotlight,

109
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,080
which is maybe why with only 10 out of 
26 episodes exploring our heroes,

110
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:41,914
personal stories,
we're still able to relate so much to 

111
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:45,460
them.
Seriously.

112
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,294
Guys who did not feel like crying when 
phages lies down in the wreckage of her 

113
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:50,044
childhood home.
But saifai isn't the only genre cowboy 

114
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:58,321
bebop works in.
Yeah,

115
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,710
if the title wasn't enough of a dead 
giveaway.

116
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,450
Cowboy bebop also plays heavily with 
western conventions more than anything.

117
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,284
The first session,
asteroid blues really sets the tone and 

118
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,004
the episode Jen and Spike Hunt Down the 
drug dealer asthma of Solon son and his 

119
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:20,191
girlfriend catarina in Tiawana there 
saloon fights and Stetson hats.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,393
Indigenous wise men,
we even see spike wearing a Poncho and 

121
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:24,454
Sombrero at one point and true to form 
even the episodes ending itself is an 

122
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,194
homage to classic western themes.
Catarina realizing the jet and the 

123
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:36,430
authorities are closing in on them.
The sides to take drastic action.

124
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,710
Adios.
As literary critic Peter French notes.

125
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,740
While rare when suicide is depicted in 
Westerns,

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,950
it has shown to be the escape of the 
week or the defeated.

127
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,383
For French,
though nothing characterizes westerns 

128
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:58,030
more than death and that's particularly 
true in cowboy bebop,

129
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,373
French rights.
The Western is about a dead man's walk 

130
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,980
or run or Gallup.
It is not accidental that so many of the

131
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:06,814
heroes and villains of Westerns are 
portrayed as having a previous history 

132
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:13,390
in the American civil war on the losing 
confederate side.

133
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,870
They have been defeated and lift with 
death and Gore in a cause.

134
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,704
They we are led to believe,
saw either as they're inescapable duty 

135
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,960
or as romantic.
So you're a man's only good for one.

136
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:28,720
All did at time.
I took mine to the confederate states of

137
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,720
America today,
Joe Sam.

138
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,250
This concept of a dead man's walk 
becomes particularly relevant with spike

139
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,383
just as Western heroes aimlessly wander 
through life carrying the burden of the 

140
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,140
romantic cause,
which has now been extinguished so to,

141
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:47,800
to spike meander through life,
carrying his tragic romance with him,

142
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,540
a romance that almost killed him.
The first detail we learn about spike is

143
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,370
that he's already died once before my

144
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,130
mouth.
Duh.

145
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,510
What did I [inaudible] [inaudible]

146
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,950
a former Hitman for the Red Dragon 
Syndicate.

147
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,260
Spike wanted to escape with the love of 
his life.

148
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,123
Julia after performing one last job 
except Julianne never showed up and the 

149
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:12,980
spikes partner,
well,

150
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,410
let's just say he's named vicious for a 
reason.

151
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,633
In the end,
spike barely managed to escape with his 

152
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:19,394
life,
with everyone in his old life believing 

153
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:21,824
he died.
But instead of washing his hands of 

154
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:24,494
everything spike holds on old in all 
Nola just as French described with 

155
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:32,864
Westerns,
spike can never fully tear himself away 

156
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:35,774
from his bloody past.
Whether it's to bring a bounty on his 

157
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:39,270
former boss,
wall socket,

158
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,123
Walmart,
mono cause she said when you got or to 

159
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,173
chase after the woman he loves or to 
settle the score with vicious spike 

160
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:52,541
returns time and time again to his past.
Considering Spike nearly dies every time

161
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:53,834
he runs after his past.
We've got to wonder what duty could be 

162
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:56,984
so important,
especially since he once told Faye that 

163
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,250
the past doesn't matter anymore.

164
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,913
Dakota,

165
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,460
golden winkeljohn and Blah,

166
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,580
doug about

167
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,583
cargo,
all the water meter you out with that 

168
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,620
all well,
digging deeper into the genre,

169
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,543
the answer isn't too much of a stretch.
As literary critic Jane Tompkins notes 

170
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:20,014
in her book west of everything.
The heroes and villains of Westerns 

171
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,360
aren't concerned with traditional Judeo 
Christian ethics.

172
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,553
The harsh reality of the desert and 
they're outlawed in lifestyles won't 

173
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,640
allow it.
Instead,

174
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,660
their moral code revolves around honor 
as French elaborates.

175
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,170
What after all is the value of residents
in the Kingdom of Heaven?

176
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,123
If the cost is one self respect,
we see this in almost every character 

177
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,610
from spikes past but most vividly in a 
vicious,

178
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,803
vicious ever.
The sociopath holds a mite is right 

179
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,000
attitude.
Those who can't or won't fight according

180
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:52,834
to vicious shouldn't be allowed to live.
It's the reason why he killed his boss 

181
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,763
and later stage to coop.
It's also the reason why he seeks to 

182
00:10:59,111 --> 00:10:59,944
kill spike,
the man who has renounced his violent 

183
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,270
past.

184
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,270
We'll wait.
[inaudible] this new shoe modeling.

185
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,230
Some of you came on though so much 
trouble.

186
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,890
Son Christopher Nolan,

187
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,180
but even vicious,
seemingly wants a fair fight with spike.

188
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,680
He passed up easy opportunities to kill 
his mortal foe when spike was passed out

189
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,740
on one of Jupiter's moons.
This just leaves him unharmed,

190
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,440
mostly tall.
No,

191
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:33,470
I'm not at the home and when spike and 
vicious or in their final duel,

192
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,483
they both passed their own preferred 
weapons to each other instead of either 

193
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:40,370
taking the advantage.
As for spike,

194
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,010
his decision to kill vicious isn't about
him being a serious piece of shit.

195
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,403
In part,
it's about writing a personal wrong 

196
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,983
Julia's death as French reminds us,
the hero of a western is not the cowboy 

197
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:53,204
equivalent of the caped crusader.
The wrongs must always relate to some 

198
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,094
harm suffered either by him directly or 
by someone with whom he has established 

199
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,324
a relationship,
but there's also a more philosophical 

200
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:07,330
reason behind spikes decision and it has
to do with skepticism.

201
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,643
Since leaving the syndicate,
Spike has wondered if he ever really 

202
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,330
survived at all wondering if what he saw
was real cuddle.

203
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,193
No real

204
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,330
did you call,
didn't have Christmas Day cutoff.

205
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,540
[inaudible] called the hold on medical 
call me day.

206
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,650
Many me fucking I came to Janae 
specifically.

207
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,543
Spike continually floats the idea that 
everything he sees could just be a 

208
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:40,270
dream.
[inaudible] emailed me.

209
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,253
In this sense,
spike echoes the skepticism of ancient 

210
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:45,224
Chinese philosopher lungs up who roped.
Once upon a time I [inaudible] was a 

211
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:54,080
butterfly fluttering hither and thither.
To all intents and purposes,

212
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,973
a butterfly.
I was conscious only of my happiness as 

213
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:59,900
a butterfly on aware that I was one 
zone.

214
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,800
Soon I awake and there I was there to 
bleed myself again.

215
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,963
Now I do not know whether I was then a 
man dreaming I was a butterfly or 

216
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:08,984
whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I 
am a man spike struggling to make sense 

217
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:14,054
of life before and after the syndicate 
wonders if maybe he never really left 

218
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,180
the syndicate at all.
He wonders if he really died that night.

219
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,403
It's only after losing the love of his 
life that he accepts the cruel reality 

220
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:27,500
of the situation.
He's been awake the whole time.

221
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,010
[inaudible] it's anybody can submit you 
for spike.

222
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,060
His dead man's walk isn't just to take 
revenge on vicious.

223
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,240
It's paradoxically to show himself that 
he's awake or as he tells Fay shitty new

224
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,403
coworkers.
Nay.

225
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,710
Yeah.

226
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,110
Putting a halt on each to Ricardo car.
And while it's up for debate,

227
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,810
whether spike dies after his final fight
with vicious,

228
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,750
I've got to say,
spike would make clint eastwood proud by

229
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,820
storming vicious his hideout.
Oh.

230
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,713
And wondering why vicious and spike and 
go at it with the Katana and a pistol 

231
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,730
and the whole fight still feels 
believable.

232
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,740
Yeah.
It's because Ronin films,

233
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,190
you know,
Japanese period pieces that followed the

234
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,033
loan.
Samurai dispensing personal justice are 

235
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,880
pretty much the cultural equivalent of 
Westerns.

236
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,500
In fact,
from the epic one,

237
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:17,334
men armies to the tent silence before 
the dual westerns in Ronan's have 

238
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,070
created a fairly shared visual and 
thematic identity.

239
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,410
But that's another video.
Finally,

240
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,303
the third and perhaps most notable genre
cowboy bebop works in is no are 

241
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,570
strangely no.
Our is notoriously hard for film critics

242
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,070
to define.
For example,

243
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,000
Raymond Board and Etienne show Matam 
defined it in their seminal text,

244
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,893
a panorama of American film,
the war as having five feet 

245
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,400
characteristics,
dreamlike,

246
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,080
strange,
erotic,

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,940
ambivalent,
and cruel,

248
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,710
but many popular noir.

249
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,543
Our films don't hit all the marks while 
every character is influenced by film 

250
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,360
noir.
Jimmy.

251
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,250
No,
he's telling me it's the book.

252
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:59,084
Can you come by?
I think the genre has the greatest pool 

253
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,830
on Faye and jet.
Sorry.

254
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,950
Spike thing is clearly a femme fatale 
one,

255
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:10,220
a film noirs favorite conventions.
See one film,

256
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,054
no,
our first captured the popular 

257
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:12,734
imagination following World War II.
There were few representations of women 

258
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,320
that depicted them as anything other 
than swooning,

259
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,450
fainting,
walking pairs of ovaries.

260
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,120
But as literary scholar,
Jamie place notes,

261
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,133
no war changed that and became one of 
the few periods of film in which women 

262
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,510
are active,
not static.

263
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:34,511
Symbols are intelligent and powerful if 
destructively so and derive power,

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,650
not weakness from their sexuality.
They is definitely intelligent,

265
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,484
powerful in sexual.
She's constantly one step ahead of her 

266
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,694
male peers.

267
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,090
Gee,
you took on a [inaudible] [inaudible] na

268
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,880
gene Kolkata dinner

269
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,680
and she isn't above using her sexuality 
to get what she wants.

270
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,303
That's good.

271
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,563
And whilst some like critic Julie 
Grossman have criticized the trope for 

272
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:19,680
being an overly simplistic reduction of 
lady agency in the world,

273
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,800
Faye is a little more dynamic.
In fact,

274
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,663
she's the only character who really 
makes us substantive and channel change 

275
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,000
by the series end,
but her narrative arc also taps into the

276
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:33,420
very philosophical spine of know are 
nihilism.

277
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,480
Yes,
I know nihilism has become wise cracks.

278
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:38,070
Favorite dead horse,
but hey,

279
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,480
I didn't put it in the Zeitgeists.
According to literary critic Mark Conrad

280
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,523
Nawar Develop as a consequence of the 
20th century ushering out old belief 

281
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:47,874
systems,
when Nisha famously proclaimed God is 

282
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:50,754
dead,
he was making a statement that these 

283
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:56,460
seeming like a turtle systems like God,
morality or even truth,

284
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,930
we're illusions.
Reality to Nisha is in constant flux,

285
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,600
which means things like definitions,
constants,

286
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,650
and even being don't exist over time,
whether he was right or wrong,

287
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,750
Nisha was correct in predicting the 
mass,

288
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:13,620
alienation and loneliness brought on by 
the disillusionment of these systems.

289
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,490
As science chipped away at our happy 
belief systems in the 20th century,

290
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,150
people became lost.
An anxious and wise crack was born.

291
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,810
Conrad Rights.
Seeing the war as a response or reaction

292
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,530
to the death of God helps explain the 
commonality of the elements that critics

293
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:31,440
have noted in new our films.
The inherent pessimism,

294
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,393
alienation and disorientation.
And if there's one character who's 

295
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:40,020
continually had belief system after 
belief system ripped away from her,

296
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,210
it's Fay.
When fay first awakes,

297
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,640
she doesn't actually believe that she's 
in the future.

298
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,850
That is until your lawyer's teller that 
she's got it all wrong.

299
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,160
And you sent him book cause you were 
hunting

300
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,470
in this sort of [inaudible] Cintiq yes.

301
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,250
And if waking up in an unrecognizable 
future sounds bad,

302
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,270
try adding trust issues.
When Faye finds out that her old lawyer,

303
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,330
you know the one she fell in love with 
had faked his death,

304
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,343
you can bet your bottom dollar that she 
felt the same lonely anxiety that Nisha 

305
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,233
had described.
Many of whom today [inaudible] and Faye 

306
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:14,474
experiences the ultimate disillusionment
when she finds out that the goal she's 

307
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:18,284
been searching for her past is gone 
after Ed takes page of the place where 

308
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:22,604
she grew up.
The two are greeted by an old classmate 

309
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,980
emphasis on old,
oh not though this you Saudi,

310
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,430
you.
Hi Scooter.

311
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,273
No Tokina dual cuna time like niches,
idea of reality is in constant motion 

312
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,390
and it's left fay behind realizing that 
she can never get her old life back.

313
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,450
They calls herself a ghost,
but got an eye this year.

314
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,950
[inaudible] as she later tells spike the
life that she thought she wanted,

315
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,873
the home that she wanted to return to 
his no more fake is not the only know 

316
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:03,514
our s character who's a trench coat 
wearing cop for a number says 

317
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,040
sweetheart.
Like this.

318
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,993
Yeah,
it's everyone's favorite chef jess like 

319
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:10,844
faith.
Just the backdrop borrows heavily from 

320
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,064
no our conventions.
A former cop jet suffered two massive 

321
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:17,840
blows in his past.
First,

322
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,000
his lover walked out on him without 
warning

323
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,410
what you know,
cleared dixter dog Solo Tokyo dogging on

324
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:28,411
mogul Tita [inaudible] sooner

325
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,773
and second,
he was nearly killed when he cornered a 

326
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,990
syndicate assassin.
Oh,

327
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,640
and did I mention jets nickname?

328
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,870
[inaudible] on.
Oh,

329
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,780
could I cheat.
Dot.

330
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,110
[inaudible]

331
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,820
so we've got a former cop turned pie.
I mean bounty hunter who's pining over a

332
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,080
loss love.
Yeah,

333
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,973
it's no arm like Fay jet has to learn.
The time moves forward and with it 

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,180
everyone else consider the pocket.
Watch the jets lover.

335
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,140
Alyssa left him.

336
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,390
I [inaudible] I said it though.

337
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,833
Well,
the symbolism might be a bit heavy 

338
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:25,664
handed here.
Jet Holding onto the broken watch 

339
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:27,854
represents his desire to return to the 
past to a time when his watch still tit 

340
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,130
and Elisa waited for him to come home 
from work.

341
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,650
But when jet seeks answers about the 
past,

342
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,480
he's reminded that it's long gone.
Elisa has a new life and a new boyfriend

343
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,463
and only jet is wondering why.
Worse when a lease a finally gives jet 

344
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:49,240
the answers he's looking for,
they shatter his ideas of the past.

345
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,313
As it turns out,
jets relationship wasn't so perfect and 

346
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:53,950
Elisa felt trapped.

347
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,820
That's what he eats.
And what that does,

348
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,570
the three to tookie he's jacking.
Yeah.

349
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,783
In the end,
jet can't return to his past because 

350
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,740
this idealized past never existed at 
all.

351
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,270
Looking back at that interstitial about 
playing without fear of risky things,

352
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,360
breaking traditional styles and creating
new genres,

353
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,343
it's hard to argue that series director,
she needs zero Watanabe didn't do just 

354
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:33,130
that in cowboy bebop.
Saifai westerns.

355
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,380
No,
are even a little Ronan action.

356
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,670
It's all here and it's all excellent.
It's this very genre bending that's made

357
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:40,504
the series so popular and it's the 
reason why cowboy bebop seems so fresh 

358
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:44,404
two decades later and there's nothing 
like the story that can withstand the 

359
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,700
test of time.
If Cowboy Bebop,

360
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:49,960
