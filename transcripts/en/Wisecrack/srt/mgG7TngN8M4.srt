00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,903
Hey wisecrack jared here today we're 
talking about an Amazon and she has 

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,810
nothing to do with an endangered plant 
species or free two day shipping.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,990
Wonder woman wasn't just the mega box 
office hit of the summer.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,883
The film and its eponymous hero have 
become one of 2017 biggest cultural 

8
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,550
icons and surprise.
We have something to say about it.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,970
Now some have called areas a pretty lack
luster villain,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,833
but his conflict with Diana is pretty 
interesting compared to most superhero 

11
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,004
villains who want to just rule the world
or ruled world or rule as guard or rule 

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,624
the universe and part of what makes this
Greek God family drama so cool is that 

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,883
aries doesn't just blindly hate Diana.
There clash over the nature and fate of 

14
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
humanity is well pretty philosophical,
so get ready to be lassoed by the truth 

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,184
in this wise crack addition on the 
philosophy of wonder woman and cue the 

16
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,144
sirens.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,050
One of the central conflicts of wonder 
woman is do humans deserve to be saved?

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,063
This makes sense.
Since the titular characters from an 

19
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:06,674
island of warrior women who exist solely
to save humans from destruction at the 

20
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,020
hand of aries,
the God of war.

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,690
But as it turns out,
when you've lived in a tropical paradise

22
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,580
with no boys allowed for a couple of 
millennia,

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,700
you might decide that humans aren't 
really worth the effort.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,170
View's great demand to be Justin Wise,
strong and passionate.

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,200
That was a story.
Diane,

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,340
much of Diana's struggle is wrapped up 
in the question of what it means to save

27
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,710
people.
She waivers between a sense of duty,

28
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:35,720
a sense of caring and a moment of great 
a apathy they done deserve our help.

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,190
It's not about meanwhile Erin is fully 
committed to the belief that humans suck

30
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,524
a fat bag of popsicles and deserve not 
only abandonment but also to die 

31
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:49,300
painfully via chemical weapons.
Area's developed a weapon.

32
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,134
The worst ever device.
Diana's big hero statement of the film 

33
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:57,721
is in response to areas his claim that 
she responds,

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,000
it's not about deserve,
it's not what you believe.

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,363
We believe that line is confusing is,
but instead of dismissing it as bad 

36
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,490
writing and good old wise cracking and 
fashion,

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,860
let's pull it apart.
Now before we get the Diana,

38
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:19,350
we have to understand what she's 
responding to.

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,520
Areas is belief that humans are 
worthless and can't have nice things.

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,920
Aries is claiming the film has two 
parts,

41
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,963
one that humans deserve to be punished 
and to that they don't deserve Diana's 

42
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,464
help.

43
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,973
Right?

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,890
The first one is a question of something
called retribute of justice.

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,843
Basically the theory that argues that 
people who do bad things should go to 

46
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,234
jail.
So what informs areas as retribute of 

47
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:48,964
mission to destroy humanity?
He believes that humans are by nature 

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,833
evil

49
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,550
and always will be weak,
cruel,

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,420
selfish,
and capable of the greatest harvest.

51
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,493
This is an essential list view of human 
nature that humanity has inherit 

52
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,634
properties that make them what they are,
so people are doomed to be useless 

53
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:12,684
assholes forever.
So it makes sense why you'd want to get 

54
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:15,870
rid of them.
Areas.

55
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:16,704
His claim is bolstered by the summer of 
humanities actions over the last couple 

56
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,960
thousand years and that time humans have
done a lot.

57
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,003
They genocide it.
A bunch of people destroyed the 

58
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,970
environment and made this Logan Paul 
Guy,

59
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:27,804
famous

60
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,960
mankind ruin bid day by day.

61
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,740
So that's the first part of areas.
His claim.

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,783
Now for the second one,
one that is much more central to Diana 

63
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,324
and the film's Arc,
the question of who deserves to be 

64
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,650
saved,
even if it's from their own kind.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,633
This is distributive justice in aries 
calculation being saved from death is 

66
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,620
not something that one is entitled to.
It's something that is distributed based

67
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:56,454
on merit as shown by the actions of the 
individual or in this case the actions 

68
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,770
of the groups spanning three plus 
Millennia.

69
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,010
This seems to be a pretty common idea 
among mortals.

70
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,750
Diane,
his mother Hippolyta tells her,

71
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,883
do not deserve you.
This all reflects one popular approach 

72
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,930
to distribute of justice called desert 
theory,

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,760
which are used that people deserve 
things,

74
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:15,600
jobs,
money,

75
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,434
awards based on their actions rather 
than on their needs or the benefit it 

76
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,880
would bring to society.
Now,

77
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:21,714
although Diana stays generally 
consistent in her desire to help 

78
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,074
humanity,
the logic behind this choice develops 

79
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,260
and changes throughout the film.

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,740
And while we see people justifying their
actions with distributed or Richard,

81
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:34,560
you'd have frameworks,
wonder woman goes a different route.

82
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,090
Diana is raised to believe that the 
amazons have a sacred duty to stop aries

83
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:41,670
and defend the world.
So when she sets out for Europe,

84
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:44,520
she's not doing it because she believes 
humans deserve anything.

85
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,550
It's because she has a moral obligation 
to help.

86
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,670
This moral obligation carries her 
through most of the film.

87
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,550
Even as she watches British general send
soldiers to their debt,

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,790
you should be ashamed and Germans taking
villagers as slaves.

89
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,743
But at some point she realizes that 
people suck and it wasn't totally areas 

90
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,600
his fault that they were bayoneting each
other.

91
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,620
They can stop fighting.
Why are they still,

92
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:08,454
cause I've picked up sensor duty was to 
defend the world from aries and not 

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,713
humans acting on their own accord.
She's not really sure where her moral 

94
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,770
obligations lie anymore.

95
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,000
All of a sudden her mom's wise words 
sound a whole lot wiser.

96
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,980
And my thought was right not to serve 
yet.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Diana's faced with a crisis of 
conscious.

98
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,533
She's no longer bound by duty and her 
knowledge of human atrocities leader to 

99
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:34,890
the conclusion that humans do not merit 
her help as a matter of justice either.

100
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,250
Although Diana makes it less obvious 
than areas does.

101
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,800
She's also motivated by a kind of 
essential ism.

102
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,230
Let's call this the battle of essential 
isms.

103
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,630
Arie says,
humans are inherently evil.

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,493
Diana says they're inherently good.
While aries never abandoned his 

105
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,660
essential ism,
Diana does,

106
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:54,810
when she discovers humans can be dick 
bags all on their own.

107
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,830
We don't see too much more of this 
crisis,

108
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,930
but all is resolved by the time she 
says.

109
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,640
At first it might sound like she 
believes in the love of Steve Trevor,

110
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:05,474
but that doesn't make a ton of sense,
so let's give her a little more credit 

111
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,540
than that.

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,980
It's only at the end that it becomes 
clear to her and to us why saving people

113
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,814
is the right thing to do.
What differentiates Diana at the end 

114
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,474
from someone like Captain America is 
that she realizes it's not her duty to 

115
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,614
help people.
She just wants to because she loves the 

116
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,494
shit out of humanity.
Even though that might sound like a 

117
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:28,874
Saccharin care bear cop out,
it's not while she leaves behind the 

118
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:32,984
ideas of duty and deserving wonder woman
taps into a totally different ethical 

119
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,544
approach.
That's pretty unique in the superhero 

120
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,130
genre.
Hair.

121
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,973
Epic's care ethics focuses on the 
relationship between the person who is 

122
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,580
caring for someone and the person who 
was terrible.

123
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,490
For a good example,
a parent who loves their child,

124
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,190
even if that child is terrible,
or Logan.

125
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,024
Paul,
unlike most traditional approaches to 

126
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,484
ethics,
Kara ethics rejects universalized 

127
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,660
principles for how to make judgments or 
how to act.

128
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,720
Everything is contextualized within the 
given relationship.

129
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,030
However,
certain practices are pretty important,

130
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,380
like respect,
empathy,

131
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,214
and attention to the needs of others.
Sometimes these relationships are on 

132
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,120
equal footing,
but not always.

133
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,163
Wonder woman is not are equal.
So it's more like a person caring for a 

134
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:15,794
perfect puppy,
just like you're not born with an 

135
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:18,434
obligation to care for.
A dog wonder woman knowingly chooses to 

136
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,274
enter a relationship of care with people
who will never be able to entirely 

137
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,384
reciprocate and maybe don't deserve it.
She isn't pursuing a defined goal other 

138
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,604
than making the world a better place or 
holding firm to certain universal 

139
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,084
principles like that man's idea that 
killing is always wrong or captain 

140
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:38,924
America's belief in the American way.
As long as you forget that whole hail 

141
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,450
hydra thick,
she is responding as needed to the needs

142
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:46,130
of those.
She cares for him.

143
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,263
At the end of the film,
Diana's relationship rejects a kind of 

144
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:54,290
distributed or retributive justice and 
instead she makes a choice to love them,

145
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,613
but then I glimpsed the darkness that 
lives within their lines and learn that 

146
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,014
inside every one of them there will 
always be both and now I know only love 

147
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,490
can truly save the world.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,880
Diana's belief in love isn't a 
meaningless platitudes.

149
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,983
It's a declaration of her commitment to 
a particular state of mind and action 

150
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,823
that guides her decisions as a hero.
This is clear in her decision not to 

151
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:27,540
kill Dr poison despite her being a war 
criminal and also really creepy

152
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,840
is the perfect example.
Pull off these humans.

153
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,140
I'm not going to want to be up y'all so 
proper hear that

154
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,783
although we would be a bit of a stretch 
to say that wonder woman enters a 

155
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:42,400
relationship of care with colonel 
mustard gas just because she decides not

156
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,234
to throw a literal tank at her.
It's indicative of Diana's change in 

157
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,534
mindset.
This is visually paralleled by doctor 

158
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,324
poisons,
mass flying off piece by piece as the 

159
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:54,100
wind uncovers her true,
scarred ugly self.

160
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,083
There's a very obvious metaphor and 
Diana recognizes the complex nature and 

161
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,540
individual differences of humans.

162
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,250
Everything you say so much

163
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,280
more,
even though by most calculations,

164
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:07,114
Dr poison probably deserves to die.
Diana rejects the concept of deserving 

165
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,973
and by extension rejects the desert 
theory of justice that aries is so fond 

166
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,114
of every superhero has his or her or its
reasons for blowing stuff up and saving 

167
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:21,424
the day.
Wonder woman defines Diana's ethos of 

168
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,004
care and solidifies her role in the 
Justice League for many franchises to 

169
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:27,754
come,
but it also draws out a frequent theme 

170
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:32,980
in comics.
The worthiness of the People Save Gotham

171
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:36,370
doesn't deserve Batman and America 
doesn't deserve Steve Rogers.

172
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,310
Wonder woman raises a question that we 
don't usually hear.

173
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,710
Does humanity deserve to be saved at 
all?

174
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,110
And even if they don't,
should we save them?

175
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,240
Anyway,
thanks for watching you guys.

176
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,283
