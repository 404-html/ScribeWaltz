1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,530
A wise crack flesh,
jared,

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,940
again,
before we get into it,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:06,774
just a note,
we didn't do a quick take last week 

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:09,390
because,
well,

5
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:12,960
while the world early conspiracy was one
of our favorite episodes of the season,

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,030
we didn't really have much to add to the
discussion,

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,790
but we're back to take on season three,
episode six,

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,420
where we'll be looking at the toxic side
of our favorite adventuring duo.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,090
I really love this episode for two 
reasons.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,103
First,
they manage to address the kind of 

11
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:26,964
character development we crave in a way 
that's both satisfying and the exact 

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,780
opposite of what regular TV does.
And second,

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,720
they tap into some really interesting 
ideas about mental health.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,250
So fire your therapist and join me on 
this quick take of rest and relaxation.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,473
A quick recap,
rick and morty need a break from almost 

16
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,350
dying all the time.
This was insane.

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,243
That was pure luck.
I was not in control of that situation 

18
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,484
at all

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,540
and come to the realization that they're
burned out.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,493
So they vacation at an alien spa and 
take a mental detoxifier for a spin 

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,413
while the dual fuel cleanse and 
rejuvenated they leave behind the parts 

22
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,954
they hate most about themselves.
Morning continues to live his life 

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,433
without these sense of crippling self 
doubt becomes the most popular kid in 

24
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,720
school and even lands a date with 
Jessica.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,730
Meanwhile,
Rick seems like a normal human being.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
Excuse me,
but this new reality is interrupted as 

27
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,184
the toxic versions of themselves managed
to escape and turn the whole world a 

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,860
weird as we praise our loving father.
July,

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,933
we made them up.
One of the cleverest aspects of this 

30
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:35,250
episode is what I'm going to call anti 
character development.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,413
As we've mentioned before,
Dan Harmon is a strict adherence to his 

32
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,370
version of Joseph Campbell's the hero's 
journey.

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,533
Now,
the relevant part here is that many 

34
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,140
stories use protagonists confronting 
their shadow.

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,303
It kind of dark reflection of themselves
that they must overcome like Dr Jekyll 

36
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,700
and Mr Hyde in terms of character 
development.

37
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,840
This overcoming usually means arch euro 
has some new insight on life,

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,823
like when a compassionate Logan 
sacrifices himself battling the 

39
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:04,830
murderous x 24,
overcoming his selfishness,

40
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,843
or when Luke Skywalker's spares darth 
vader overcoming his temptation toward 

41
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,104
the dark side.
This episode uses this structure toxic 

42
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,494
Mourdian toxic.
Rick are quite literal shadow versions 

43
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,554
of themselves,
but instead of overcoming their toxic 

44
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,494
personality traits,
this episode is a journey to reunite 

45
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,800
with their worst selves.
Excuse me.

46
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,663
Healthy morty is a smooth operator with 
lots of friends who ultimately needs to 

47
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,400
rediscover his self-loathing and 
healthy.

48
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,520
Ric is a thoughtful,
super genius who needs to rediscover his

49
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,310
narcissism and irrational care for 
morty.

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,443
If anything,
the regular kind of character 

51
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,634
development,
normally I would come down on any kind 

52
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,094
of disruption,
but it seems to represent a positive 

53
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,610
change for your character is pretty 
creepy,

54
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,703
but I also think this anti character 
development serves as a pretty smart 

55
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,110
commentary on mental health in our 
society.

56
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,213
Rest and Rick laxation asks,
what does it mean to be mentally word 

57
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,530
around school as you've become super 
healthy?

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,453
In many ways,
this episode serves as an extended 

59
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:09,100
parody of certain healthy attitudes 
promoted by self help Gurus,

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,993
popular media,
and the occasional life purpose 

61
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:14,020
cheerleader.
I swear they exist in La.

62
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,880
Focus on the good things.
Trust me.

63
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,620
Things are good.
In particular,

64
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,454
this idea that we must strive to 
eliminate any thoughts that are 

65
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,350
unpleasant or painful.
Hashtag positive vibes.

66
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,480
Hashtag selfcare.
Hashtag blessed Hashtag.

67
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,314
Sorry dot sorry.
Now there are a ton of installation 

68
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,044
tools will tell you that being mentally 
healthy means uncritically loving 

69
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,270
yourself,
saying yes to everything,

70
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,700
counting your blessings and believing in
yourself,

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,700
no matter how stupid your passive income
scheme is.

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,653
However,
Rick and morty shows us that these 

73
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,060
ideals fully embodied will make you seem
like a coked out Weirdo.

74
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,050
You know,
you're so quiet.

75
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,670
What's wrong?
Why don't you tell me about yourself?

76
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,560
What's the atmosphere like on Planet 
Jessica?

77
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,860
I think one of the ideas of the show is 
getting at is something sociologists,

78
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,460
William Davies has written about in his 
book the happiness industry.

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,353
For our longtime fans,
we actually talked about this book and 

80
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,114
our inside out video.
Demis writes about a concept he calls 

81
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:04,324
compulsory happiness that in our modern 
world there exists a kind of alliance 

82
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,420
between corporations,
managers,

83
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,254
and advertisers to promote a definition 
of mental health that ultimately serves 

84
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,520
the capitalist society,
that we live in a kind of happiness that

85
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,100
involves cheerfully accepting the status
quo.

86
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,820
Something touched on by rick before 
because I don't respect therapy.

87
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,400
I think it's helped a lot of people get 
comfortable and start panicking,

88
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,383
which is a state of mind.
We value in the animals who eat this 

89
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:34,930
kind of happiness also requires constant
self improvement for the sake of being a

90
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,830
better consumer.

91
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,410
Let's work off your trauma with some 
urban spin yoga.

92
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,300
It's amazing.
You do yoga on a bike,

93
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,250
but you have an at risk preteen.
I think I can just blow this off.

94
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,093
Morning,
we see morty spouting platitudes that 

95
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,190
seemed lifted from a Tony Robbins book.
I love drums.

96
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,510
I never took drum lessons.
Why?

97
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,090
Limitations?
We are addicted to our own limitations.

98
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,924
How amazing is that demanding that 
everyone around him partake in his new 

99
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,820
lifestyle?
You have to do this detox thing.

100
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,200
I did.
Is that an alien spa?

101
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,063
You go through it and when confronted 
with real life problems like a scented 

102
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,910
part of himself being trapped in hell,
his answer is,

103
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,710
trust me.
Things are good.

104
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,860
Taking that away from me,
that wouldn't be healthy.

105
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,783
The problem with this is that many of 
the things the self help industry wants 

106
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:19,810
you to erase like self doubt and sadness
are pretty important.

107
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,823
In the case of Morty,
it can hold you back from becoming a 

108
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:23,524
full on sociopath and a sociopath.
He becomes in a scene lifted from the 

109
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,160
wolf of Wall Street.
It looks like healthy.

110
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,790
Morty is at the top of his game as an 
unscrupulous stockbroker,

111
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,783
handholds biotech million and a half at 
33 with a new hot redhead to replace 

112
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,524
Jessica.
Rick even compares him to another 

113
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,440
sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too
much self esteem.

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,460
Sorry,
tiny American psycho.

115
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,323
So what about rick?
Rick realizes some of these less 

116
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,384
desirable parts of ourselves,
despite the pain they caused are 

117
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,580
essential to actually being healthy.
Do the healthy thing,

118
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,414
and voluntarily read toxify yourself.
Jessica even tells marty good to have 

119
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,894
you back suggesting them mortise 
authentic self hating self is truly his 

120
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:07,784
better self,
but my only complaint with this episode 

121
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,850
is,
well,

122
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,620
it doesn't really make sense.

123
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,220
We're meant to believe that the 
undesirable parts of a person are purged

124
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,330
from their being based on their own 
subjective definition of toxicity.

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,630
How could that detox machine know the 
difference between healthy and sick?

126
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,910
For everything that goes through it,
it can't.

127
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,120
It must be by the individual's own 
definition of toxicity.

128
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,750
Yet healthy rig says this to morty.
I'm real proud to be your grandpa.

129
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,530
Morning then later claims that his 
attachment to morty is irrational,

130
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,800
therefore toxic and allows him to 
nonchalantly do this.

131
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,180
So is his love for morty toxic or 
healthy.

132
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,590
Well,
for more thoughts on that,

133
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:48,980
be sure to check out the squash our very
own rick and morty podcast.

136
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,620
