00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,180
This video is brought to you by wix.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,620
How do y'all jared?
Here we are stupid,

3
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:11,450
excited about red dead redemption.
Two,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,313
so to celebrate it coming out,
we wanted to break down numero uno and 

5
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:17,990
ask what does it all mean just like an 
older brother,

6
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:18,824
grand theft auto grand theft horse takes
a satirical look at American culture 

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,890
despite being set over a hundred years 
in the past,

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,903
but above all else,
red dead redemption is a commentary on 

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,483
our relationship to it,
and if civilization was even worth all 

10
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,024
the trouble.
So saddle up for this wisecrack edition 

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,633
on the satire of Red Dead Redemption and
of course spoilers ahead for a game 

12
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,554
that's eight years old.
First a quick shout out to our channel 

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:45,314
sponsor wicks and our last video I told 
you about some cool community stuff 

14
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,000
we're doing with their website building 
platform.

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,043
Now we're happy to unveil our first site
where you can vote on what we should 

16
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,380
cover in an upcoming episode of our 
movie podcast.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,213
Show me the meaning.
Stick around until the end to check it 

18
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,350
out.
And now back to the show.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,693
To Recap,
red dead redemption tells the story of 

20
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,094
John Marsden and Oge cowboy trying to 
become a productive member of society 

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,350
until it gets blackmailed by the 
government,

22
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:12,350
forcing him to hunt down his former gang
members Marston.

23
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:16,520
Then Moses on down that lonesome trail 
into his past seeking redemption.

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,683
See what you did though,
Rockstar so he can get back to that 

25
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,940
simple farm life so far.
Classic West,

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,780
the game even uses all the classic 
cliches,

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,610
expensive vistas,
quickdraw,

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,780
shootouts,
literal cowboying,

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,703
gambling,
Mexican and native Americans getting 

30
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,330
shot by a dude called John and horse 
riding.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,820
Lots of horse riding.
So with all this direct Oman,

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,080
where does the satire come in?
Like GTA?

33
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,914
Much of red dead set higher comes from 
the game's huge cast of non playable 

34
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:49,670
characters who at first may seem like 
stock Western archetypes.

35
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,623
There's Jenny,
the good Christian girl in the opening 

36
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:52,874
scene,

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,220
do you,
unless innocent receives communion,

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,660
they're destined to go to him,
hardly seems fair.

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,683
Or Sam Odessa,
who's on a journey to the promised land 

40
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,180
of California or old Billy West,
who asked you to collect flowers for his

41
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,014
beloved wife,
but whereas your traditional Western 

42
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:11,640
would use these tropes to tell wholesome
tales of faith,

43
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,060
hope or love,
red dead redemption has other ideas.

44
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,060
You leave Jenny to die of exposure out 
in the desert.

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,043
Sand becomes a paranoid drunk and then 
you find his body torn apart by 

46
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,280
vultures.
Oh,

47
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,190
and billy's loving wife.
You collected all those flowers for.

48
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,500
She's actually a rotting corpse.
Yes.

49
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,563
You don't look a day over 30 ma'am.
Or You have a character like Louisa and 

50
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,384
idealist with naive notions of a 
glorious revolution and a free Mexico 

51
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,110
who gets unceremoniously shot dead in 
the middle of a mission.

52
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,003
And then the man she claims to be 
engaged to can't even remember her name 

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,970
was Shay is your peasant girl wife to 
be.

54
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,720
Oh yes,
of course.

55
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,990
She will have a day named after day that
we said what?

56
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,390
Oh yes.
I knew it allowed as well.

57
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,390
This puts rdr firmly in the camp of 
something we've talked about before.

58
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,230
The Post Western,
a kind of anti western that subverts the

59
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,720
image of the old west as it's 
classically depicted,

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,763
the game pits kind old men and young 
maidens against the harsh realities of 

61
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:12,844
the lawless west or feeling how easily 
these idealists in romantics were 

62
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,210
crushed by the brutality of the great 
western expansion,

63
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,503
evenly twisted idealism of the 
tyrannical Mexican leader Colonel Again 

64
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,330
Day.
Oh,

65
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,390
I fight to help them find themselves to 
save them from themselves,

66
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,343
ends rather abruptly,
but as the characters who survive that 

67
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,154
provides the games most scathing satire.
The characters that survive tend to be 

68
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:41,020
your allies and they will suck except 
Bonnie.

69
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,943
She's fine,
but the rest are largely selfish and 

70
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:44,980
unsympathetic.

71
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,530
Leading us to wonder who we're supposed 
to be rooting for.

72
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,370
Most of them won't even assist you until
they've been assisted by you.

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,050
Take Marshall Johnson.
He has some pretty fluid ideas on how to

74
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,600
police the town of Armadillo in an early
mission,

75
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:01,150
hopefully call the political realities 
and Armadillo.

76
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,440
He reveals a conflict of interests to 
put it lightly between public safety and

77
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,150
big business.
I've got the railway.

78
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:07,984
The people are paying my salary,
trying to get me to turn a blind eye to 

79
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,680
them,
burned down settlements up there.

80
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,843
You also is more than happy to turn a 
blind eye to crime outside my 

81
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,610
jurisdiction.
That is until he owes you a favor.

82
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,320
Then there's Mr.
West Dickens,

83
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,480
the snake oil salesman,
businessman,

84
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,780
and a harmless old fraud kind of man 
that built this country,

85
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,703
a man who actively discourages people 
from acting selflessly and uses Marston 

86
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,694
to when horse racists and sell his tonic
before lending a helping hand or 

87
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:34,894
professor McDougall,
the anthropologist from an Ivy League 

88
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,714
school who also happens to be a racist 
cocaine addict whose theories on 

89
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,180
genealogy are constantly proven wrong.

90
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,163
It's remarkable.
It completely refute my last book with 

91
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,840
allies like these were forced to ask 
who's the good guy?

92
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,123
You've probably heard the phrase history
is written by the victors and red dead 

93
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,390
redemption seems to agree the federal 
marshals like Johnson are ultimately the

94
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:01,330
ones who tamed the wild west.
Professor Mcdougall,

95
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,164
who believed the native Americans to be 
barely human savages survives to bring 

96
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,514
these stories back to civilization where
the decimation of native tribes 

97
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:12,010
continued for decades,
Wild West Dickens,

98
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,180
the entrepreneur and profiteer lives to 
sell another bottle of Elixir.

99
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,140
These dick bags were the real champions 
of the wild west.

100
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,740
The idealist die while the cunning 
shysters survive,

101
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,890
such as rockstar satire of the old West 
as a post western red dead,

102
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,961
not only satirizes the western genre,
but the history of the West itself.

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,273
The game takes place at the beginning of
the 20th century when the old lawless 

104
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,764
west was dying,
killed off by industrialization and 

105
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:41,920
urban development.

106
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,933
Federal law was growing to help police 
these newer states and the industrial 

107
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,700
revolution was finally catching up with 
western expansion.

108
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,773
We'd like to think that this 
technological progress tamed the Wild 

109
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,044
West,
but the game points out that it just 

110
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,084
brings its own flavor of violence.
It gives you a railroad that you can 

111
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,920
take anywhere,
but as Marshall Johnson points out,

112
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,813
the owners burned down people's houses.
You're also given an early machine gun 

113
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,720
twice that you use to gun down entire 
rvs.

114
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,320
Not exactly your mythic cowboys,
shootouts,

115
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,000
but equally,
if not more violent,

116
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,760
but hey,
new technology is awesome.

117
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
Socialization is a truly beautiful 
thing.

118
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:19,830
Mr Marsden,

119
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,910
you end up with a pretty nuanced debate 
about the merits of civilization.

120
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,940
Just as technology came to civilize the 
west,

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,833
so did the government,
which is similarly not given a 

122
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:32,430
flattering portrayal.
For example,

123
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,820
Abraham Reyes stages a coup against the 
dope,

124
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,570
botched and cruel colonel.
Again,

125
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:37,404
day in Mexico before we meet him.
Reyes is described as a heroic 

126
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:42,630
revolutionary leader of great moral 
work.

127
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,630
He doesn't care for the bourgeois 
snobbery or elitism

128
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,510
when we do meet him.
However,

129
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,130
he's a lying,
arrogant,

130
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:54,000
selfish womanizer who isn't stirring up 
revolution to free Mexico,

131
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,720
but to get money in power with no 
intention of leading once it's attained

132
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,050
like any great leader,
my brother I will delegate.

133
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,150
The other representative of government 
is Edgar Ross.

134
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,133
You know the US official who has the 
backing of the US government so he can 

135
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,250
civilize the west.
Well,

136
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,580
he forces you to murder your former 
friends by stealing your family.

137
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,573
We need you to find them.
Williamson then had to blackwater as 

138
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:17,454
quick as you can,
and we have reason to believe that Dr 

139
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,170
van Dolson does in the area or your wife
sends her regards

140
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,223
and when you accomplish your goal,
since the entire army to your house to 

141
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,700
shoot you to pieces even says,

142
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,520
see we,
me and archer,

143
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,510
we're the bad guys.
We enforce the rules.

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,473
This is a world where the good guys call
themselves bad guys and the bad guys 

145
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,733
think they're good guys.
So if the game is targeting the people 

146
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,900
who built the institutions that survive 
today,

147
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,540
isn't that kind of bleak?
Well,

148
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,403
Rockstar may not be full of quite as 
many edge lords as it seems as their 

149
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:59,100
conclusion on the merits of civilization
is quite complex.

150
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,203
So sure,
John Marsden and Co argue that while 

151
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,070
life is an outlaw is violent and often 
ugly,

152
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,933
they are at least free,
but the feds point out that the cowboys 

153
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:12,930
violence that comes from defending their
freedom kinda sucks for everyone else.

154
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,490
I'll tell you what the alternative is.
It's not complicated.

155
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,150
It's about one man and his gun versus 
another man.

156
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,450
Sure,
civilization may be dull,

157
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,250
but the alternative Mr Marsden is hell.

158
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,640
This bleak satire of society can be 
summed up in the chief antagonist of the

159
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,900
game.
Dutch band,

160
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,743
Holland.
Dutch is the former leader of Marston's 

161
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:37,040
old gang and the man you're sent to 
kill,

162
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,560
but he isn't quite a classic Western 
billing.

163
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,930
We hear from Marston how Dutch raised 
him.

164
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,160
Leader of the gang taught me how to 
read.

165
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,920
He taught me how to see all that was 
good in the world.

166
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,840
It was a great man in a way,
and

167
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,400
whenever we meet Dutch,
he's eloquent and honest.

168
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,420
Violent,
sure,

169
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,254
but isn't everyone in this game.
And then there's the fact that his new 

170
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:00,570
posse consists almost entirely of 
disenfranchised native Americans who see

171
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,404
Dutch as a savior.
The only native American character who 

172
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,770
talks to Marston and his allies is 
nastiness,

173
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,540
is patronized and insulted by Professor 
Mcdougall and then shot in the head is a

174
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,374
trader by his own people.
Dutch is trying to stand against the 

175
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,750
march of the so called civilization of 
the West.

176
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
That Marston's mission represents having
seen what it does to people in their 

177
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,620
communities before Dutch dies.
He says,

178
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,040
when I'm gone,
they'll do is find another monster.

179
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,813
Yeah,

180
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,830
because they have to justify their wages
for Dutch.

181
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,610
If you want an industrialized military 
with machine guns and motorcars,

182
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,180
you need to justify that investment with
an enemy to use it against,

183
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,253
which makes his character of less an 
oblique satire and more of an on the 

184
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:44,824
nose commentary,
seeing as it would only be three years 

185
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:47,434
later,
that world war one would break out in 

186
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:50,224
red dead redemption,
not only as our nostalgic view of the 

187
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,810
old west wrong,
but so is the idea that the civilization

188
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,644
that replaced it is somehow better.
We're left with a world in which the 

189
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:02,560
crooked businessmen,
selfish revolutionaries,

190
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,453
morally bankrupt,
academics and corrupt government 

191
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,950
officials are the ones laying the 
building blocks of the new world.

192
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,873
While the selfless are forgotten.
With this kind of pessimism running 

193
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:13,714
through the game,
it's no wonder a key mantra throughout 

194
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,330
his

195
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,060
erase your past Mr.
Marsden

196
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,150
and that

197
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,150
you can erase the past.
Come won't make it go away

198
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,293
and

199
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,460
he's old.
That's it.

200
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,640
CanNot be nice.

201
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,570
Just as John can't escape his violent 
past,

202
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,870
neither can America.
Thanks for sticking around.

203
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:40,950
Guys were very excited to unveil the 
first of our mini sites that we designed

204
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,650
using wix.
We're currently doing a full overhaul of

205
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,870
our main website and it's going to be 
awesome,

206
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,110
but we wanted to get some new features 
rolled out as soon as possible.

207
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,330
I'm not the most savvy guy with 
computers,

208
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:55,740
so I was really pleased with how robust 
and professional wix site building tools

209
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:56,574
where it's nice when you have an idea in
your head on how something should look 

210
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,893
and the technology you're using gives 
you the options to make it happen 

211
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,463
without the hassle.
So whether you're a seasoned pro or a 

212
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:07,614
total newb like me,
if you're thinking about building or 

213
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,464
upgrading the website,
I encourage you to check out what you 

214
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,630
can do with wix and in the meantime,
head over to our site,

215
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,710
linkedin,
the description,

216
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,650
and let us know what you'd like us to 
cover in an upcoming episode of.

217
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,570
Show me the meeting and as always,
guys,

218
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,100
thanks for watching.
Peace.
