00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,920
Hey everyone,
meet boat jared here,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,813
season three,
episode seven of Rick and Morty is one 

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,960
of the darkest and densest of the 
season.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,470
In less than half an hour,
the episode managed to build a rich,

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,950
complex and utterly dismal political 
world,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,650
only for the show to summarily dismiss 
it.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,990
Still not curious about what might've 
happened at that crazy senate up place,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,030
not at all,
Laurie.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,100
That place will never have any bearing 
over our lives ever again,

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,063
but in that short time,
the rick lantis mix up paints a really 

11
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:35,330
interesting picture of modern politics 
specifically as it pertains to hope,

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,343
resistance and revolution.
Welcome this wise crack quick take on 

13
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:41,510
the ric Lantis Mixup,
and you guessed it,

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,030
spoilers ahead,
but before we get into that,

15
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:44,864
I want to thank quid for sponsoring this
video quite as a really cool app that 

16
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:49,820
allows you to collect stickers,
cards,

17
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:50,654
and toys for free.
Featuring a bunch of the shows we love 

18
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:56,180
here at wise crack breaking bad 
adventure time,

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,770
Bob's Burgers,
Star Trek,

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,080
and most importantly,
rick and morty.

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,020
Think of it like opening up packs of 
baseball cards.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,100
I've actually been collecting rick and 
morty stickers for about a month now and

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,460
it's actually amazing how quick they are
to add new stickers.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,080
Pretty much the day after a new episode 
is released,

25
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:12,914
they have new gifts and stickers that 
you can send to your friends over taxed 

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,690
or slap onto images in your camera roll.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,020
My favorite is the mailman from 
[inaudible] that says,

28
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,800
mom,
man,

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,710
check out the description below for a 
link to grab the APP for free.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,860
It's available on Ios and android.
I'm on there as jared.

31
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,730
See One 37.
Last time we did this for a 600.

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,573
Have you added me as a friend and we had
some cool chats and trades with some of 

33
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,360
you.
So Adam,

34
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,000
he is a friend and trade me all your 
Miseq swag.

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,920
Thanks a bunch.
Back to the show.

36
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,053
So a quick recap,
rick and morty go on an adventure to 

37
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:44,840
Atlantis,
but don't worry.

38
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,770
That actually doesn't matter.
Instead we're thrown into the citadel of

39
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:52,460
Rick's as they rebuild after the 
catastrophic events of the shank.

40
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,294
Redemption,
democratic elections are being held for 

41
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:59,600
the first time in the wake of the 
disillusion of the council districts.

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,003
Hold on,
hold on.

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,420
The world building in this episode is 
freaking amazing,

44
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,463
especially in how it cleverly mirrors 
our current political climate from a 

45
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:10,664
news organization that's only one end 
away from CNN that trivializes descent 

46
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,760
in order to maintain the status quo.

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,720
Anyway,
so yeah,

48
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,510
the suspect says the citadels ally built
on lies,

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,373
and some others,
I say appreciate the life you have 

50
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,250
because it can always be worse

51
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,173
to an intercity devastated by drugs and 
guns to a hogwarts that teaches the 

52
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,900
disenfranchised mortise to accept their 
lot in life.

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,650
This is a great adventure.
This is a great adventure.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,513
This is definitely one of the harder 
narratives to follow and certainly more 

55
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,174
complex than your traditional episode.
So I want to lay out the many subplots 

56
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,403
as follows.
Evil morty comes to power on a platform 

57
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:52,841
of unity and change before revealing his
grander and more totalitarian intentions

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
in an illusion to training day,
a fresh out of the academy police,

59
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,850
rick has to join a crooked cop,
morty,

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,793
and confront the corrupt underbelly of 
the citadel where he is forced to 

61
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,240
confront his ideals and abandoned them.
It seems reminiscent of the ending of La

62
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,340
confidential.
We're an idealistic cop,

63
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,174
has to break the rules and kill his 
superior undermining the same justice 

64
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,704
system he fought.
He was protecting a group of orphaned 

65
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:18,250
morty.
Set off for an adventure.

66
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,084
I'll last stand by me before sending 
their hopes and dreams into the literal 

67
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,110
trash,

68
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,590
garbage dump.
Stand back.

69
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,493
Hey,
rick is passed over for a promotion and 

70
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:33,050
realizes he's wasted his life on an 
assembly line.

71
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,050
He revolts,
but his triumph is quickly ruined by the

72
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,360
powers that be.
In all of these cases,

73
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:42,170
we see any kind of political or personal
optimism for change,

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,170
crushed by a cruel and indifferent 
reality.

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,153
This episode really builds off the 
themes that we talked about earlier in 

76
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:49,970
Rick Man,
sing the stone,

77
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,710
specifically alienation or the way 
modern society is strange as us from the

78
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,470
world and our peers making us all dead 
inside.

79
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,360
In the case of rick man seeing the 
stone,

80
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,223
the creature comforts of society turn 
the exciting world of the apocalypse 

81
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,000
into a domestic nightmare.
Now we see many versions of the smartest

82
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:12,320
man in the universe reduced to the 
drudgery of modern life and mixed in.

83
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:14,990
We see signs of a deeply divided 
society.

84
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,700
The number of displaced mortise is 
soaring woolrich rick.

85
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,534
Satisfaction levels are plummeting and 
the divide between the two groups has 

86
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,370
never been whiter.
Saw that one real quick,

87
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,630
but as evil morty suggests,
this is a distraction.

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,683
Sentidos problem.
Isn't homeless mortise or outraged 

89
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:31,314
drinks?
The citadels problem is the rick and 

90
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,940
morty is feeding on the citadels deck.
The real divide,

91
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,043
the rich versus the working class.
I don't see a divide between Rick's and 

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,313
mortise.
The division IC is between the bricks 

93
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,560
and mortars that liked the citadel 
divided and the rest of us.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,610
What's interesting is

95
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,430
that despite the apparent ruling class 
of Rick's,

96
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,640
everyone is a big thing.

97
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,760
Some of alienation told us we were 
special because we were rick,

98
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,830
but they stripped us of everything that 
made us unique.

99
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,693
That doesn't sound like brick work.
You didn't come to the citadel to be a 

100
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,270
plumber.
Did you?

101
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,020
Even the cops are like into just workers
on the assembly line of Justice.

102
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,980
We know how you feel.
We're working just like you,

103
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,680
but our assembly line is justice,

104
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,980
but in addition to being victims of 
those individuals in power,

105
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,100
the rics are also victims of an 
impenetrable system,

106
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,490
and here's where my favorite part of the
whole app

107
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,350
episode comes in.
His name is simple rick,

108
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,393
but he's no dummy.
He realized long ago that the greatest 

109
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:28,870
thing he'd ever create was his daughter.
We captured that moment.

110
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,853
We run it on a loop through simple 
rick's mind and the chemical that makes 

111
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,130
his brains to create goes into every 
simple rick simple wafers,

112
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:36,964
wafer cookie,
come home to the impossible flavor of 

113
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:42,340
your own completion.
Come home to simple rick's.

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,273
This gets at a really smart question 
tackled by a lot of different 

115
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:46,904
philosophers,
but I'll summarize the issue as this is 

116
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:51,980
our escape from the alienation of modern
life.

117
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,630
Just strengthening the foundations of 
the system that drives that alienation.

118
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,523
Simple follows what I'll call beat Ron 
Swanson trope someone who fights are 

119
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,504
fast paced world by slowing down,
working with their hands and spending 

120
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:10,010
time with the family and a world that 
crams us into cubicles and hunches.

121
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:14,840
US over assembly lines are only respect 
is the simple life running away from the

122
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,030
urban clamor,
living off the land,

123
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,120
learning a trade like woodworking,
reconnecting with your family,

124
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,890
et Cetera.
Not surprisingly,

125
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:22,724
this kind of idea gained prevalence as 
the world was industrialized and 

126
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,234
subsequently corporatized.
We saw the rise of organizations like 

127
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:29,684
the boy scouts and the establishment of 
national parks where you could practice 

128
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:36,220
not being crammed in a city,
but it could be argued that this escaped

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,070
the simple life.

130
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,070
Whether in the form of nature or family 
or woodworking is not in fact retreating

131
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,154
from the system,
but an essential part of its 

132
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:45,854
functioning.
We can view these simple rick wafers 

133
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,524
brand as a kind of fantasy that 
reinforces the system rick show up for 

134
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,054
work because they know they can go home 
and allegedly unplugged from the system 

135
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,700
with the distilled essence of 
simplicity.

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,060
Even though this unplugging comes in 
commodity form,

137
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,193
one that requires you know,
money that you have to work for at an 

138
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,034
assembly line,
and we've all seen enough cereal 

139
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:12,500
commercials to know that advertisers 
love selling us a kind of pure,

140
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,334
wholesome family who actually eats meals
together without screaming at each 

141
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,180
other.
Sociologists,

142
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:22,181
George Ritter says that our enchantment 
and disenchantment from the modern world

143
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,800
are not so easy to distinguish from each
other.

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,440
He says they exist and a reciprocal 
relationship.

145
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,713
In other words,
the fantasy of unplugging with some 

146
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,274
simple rick wafers further entrenches 
you in the very system you want to 

147
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,240
unplug from,
but it gets even more devious.

148
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,280
As one rick decides he's had enough and 
engages in an actual act of rebellion,

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,353
killing his boss and trying to get a 
portal gun to actually escape the 

150
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:49,730
system,
but instead of affecting change,

151
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,450
his rebellion is commodified in the form
of the simple rick.

152
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,284
Freedom wafers selects come home to the 
unique flavor of shattering the grand 

153
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,850
illusion.
He endlessly lives the joy of rebellion.

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,150
While the system distills this joy in a 
consumable form,

155
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,540
freedom from the system in traps you in 
the system.

156
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,823
Richard goes onto say that fantasies 
drop people into the new means of 

157
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,394
consumption and those fantasies can be 
rationalized in order to further draw 

158
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:17,264
people in,
and this for me makes this the darkest 

159
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:20,894
episode of the season.
Yet the message seems to be in the 

160
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,750
terrifying political reality that is 
2017.

161
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,040
The best we can hope for is the illusion
of making a difference.

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,920
If you don't believe me,
remember the orphan mortise plot.

163
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,933
They go on a coming of age adventure 
trying to escape their terrible orphan 

164
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,550
existence and their bondage to some 
future rick,

165
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,940
but the wish portal turns out to be a 
garbage portal.

166
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,390
The system turns wishes into literal 
trash,

167
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,493
slick morty sacrifices himself to wish 
for a better world and it happens sort 

168
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,380
of holy crap.
Slicks wish came true.

169
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,250
I don't think we're meant to believe 
that his sacrifice magically made things

170
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,084
better,
especially because the change promised 

171
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:03,360
was just a ploy by evil.
Morty.

172
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,660
The subplot has no actual bearing on the
overall narrative.

173
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,673
It only seems to exist for the riders to
show us the naive ideas of these 

174
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:13,710
children that slick morty sacrifice 
could have changed something.

175
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,910
Nothing they did mattered,
but they get to believe it did just like

176
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,570
are revolting rick.
So what do we make of evil?

177
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,013
He sold a kind of class consciousness to
the rics and mores of the citadel that 

178
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,364
bricks and mortar,
you should join together to make a 

179
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,284
better world against the ruling elite,
but with the brutal purge of his 

180
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,320
political opponents.
It seems like this was nothing more than

181
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,350
lip service as a means to power,
but hey,

182
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,680
could we really expect any kind of real 
progress from this show?

183
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,670
There's just so much going on in this 
episode that we haven't touched on.

184
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,743
Like is there some connection between 
this Latin phrase on the chalkboard and 

185
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:49,764
evil mortise view of how society 
functions will discuss this as well as 

186
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:55,200
dive into the shows commentary on the 
media,

187
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,034
state violence,
and who really controls the government
