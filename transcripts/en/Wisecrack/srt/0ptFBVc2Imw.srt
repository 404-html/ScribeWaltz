1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,843
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,841
well,
you know,

3
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:13,841
the dod is a huge bureaucracy and we 
have a culture where the,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,770
it's called a Gotcha culture where,
you know,

5
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:22,390
anytime a bureaucrat makes a mistake,
the line is shot,

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,443
light shines on them and Congress 
investigates them and the General 

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,753
Accountability Office goes after them.
And so there's this tremendous risk 

8
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:34,160
aversion.
So you see government doing two things.

9
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:34,994
First,
if you have a look at a government 

10
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:36,920
document,
it's always in the passive verb,

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,920
a verb form.
Things have happened,

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,780
mistakes were made.
Who made them?

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,860
Oh,
I don't know who made them.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,950
They were made because that way no one 
has accountability and responsibility.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,950
If people were given a little more slack
to make mistakes,

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,310
then they would probably be a lot more 
accountable.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,320
Well,
take it to the next level.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,680
Do you want to reform anything?
Reformed means change.

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,663
Reform Means Dynamo.
Dynamism reform means that you might be 

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,830
looked at in a way that you know,
and before you could hide under,

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,220
behind some piece of paper.

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,870
So the bureaucracy hates reform.
When Rumsfeld came in,

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,303
uh,
he wanted to transform the Pentagon and 

24
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:18,884
one of the things he did was ask me to 
change the way we handled our financial 

25
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:25,580
management because nobody paid much 
attention to it.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Well,
one of the things I found was the people

27
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:28,994
who work in that area where themselves 
so dismissive of their work that they 

28
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,920
were nine to fivers,
they'd given up.

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,420
It was almost like,
well,

30
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,254
if they were working there,
it's probably because they weren't good 

31
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,230
enough and it wasn't true.
Some of them were very,

32
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:43,820
very good.
Um,

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,310
we made some changes.
For instance,

34
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:48,560
we had a problem that,
uh,

35
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,900
we couldn't account for all our 
transactions.

36
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,510
Sometimes there was a zip code wrong,
whatever it might be,

37
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,650
but it didn't fit to the point of two 
and a half trillion dollars.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,380
That's a lot of transactions that 
couldn't be accounted for.

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,903
I started a process.
Now I think the problem isn't measured 

40
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:08,510
in a few millions.
So we got rid of 99.9%

41
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,344
of the problem.
It took a lot of dedicated people to do 

42
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,250
that,
but all of a sudden they felt that,

43
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,563
you know,
I was paying attention to them as 

44
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:16,790
undersecretary,
but more important,

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,953
the secretary of defense cared about 
what they were doing and for bureaucrat 

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,023
to recognize,
it's not that somebody wants to 

47
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:24,974
criticize them,
but somebody cares about what they're 

48
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,190
doing.
They're going to respond differently.

49
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,610
[inaudible].
