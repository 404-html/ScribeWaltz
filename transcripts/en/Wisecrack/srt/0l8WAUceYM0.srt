1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,060
Well,
you have to do it,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,200
you have to,
you can't just be off for six months and

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:09,034
then step on a stage and expect to be 
sort of incomplete possession of your 

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,193
vocal powers.
So it's a muscle like anything else and 

5
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,670
you have to practice and you have to,
uh,

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,920
just do it.
And that's what keeps you,

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,280
I think going strong.
I can tell you a terrible story.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,610
Well,
not a terrible story,

9
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,444
but a true story.
It's dreadful when you think about it 

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,790
though.
It was back in the early nineties,

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,163
I was touring in Australia with Lucinda 
Williams and Rosanne cash and we were 

12
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:49,101
doing these songwriter nights all around
Australia and uh,

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,810
every night we and we often share the 
same big dressing room or whatever.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,340
And every night Roseanne and Lucinda 
would warm up vocally.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,233
And I,
I hadn't quite gotten to that place 

16
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,970
where I realized that how important that
was,

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,610
you know,
and Roseanne would be in her corner,

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,910
a singing scales and doing that sort of 
thing.

19
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,670
And Lucinda had some method in her 
corner,

20
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,504
just,
I think she would sort of almost bend 

21
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:21,591
over and try to breathe up and stuff and
people would sort of wonder what I would

22
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,750
do and I'd sit in my corner smoking 
cigarettes.

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,900
That's terrible.
Don't smoke anymore.

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,320
I quit that a long time ago.
But that's,

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,243
that's how naive I was about how 
important it is to take care of your 

26
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,003
boys.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,313
I know that a lot of.
I know a lot of artists who smoke say 

28
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:45,190
that and swear by it.
Um,

29
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,470
and uh,
but for me,

30
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:48,304
no,
I had to,

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,110
I had to quit a long time ago.
