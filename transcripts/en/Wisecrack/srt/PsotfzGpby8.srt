1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,440
What's up everyone?
Jared here,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,453
a few months ago,
we got an email from a fan named red 

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,154
requesting a video comparing the 
portrayal of nihilism in rick and morty 

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:11,964
and bojack horseman,
so we hit up our resident nihilism 

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,084
expert and sweatiest writer,
a wise crack Michael Burns to take a 

6
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,190
stab at it,
and if you guys have requests to be sure

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,050
to subscribe and hit us up with some 
ideas.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,003
So thanks to read,
we're going to give you guys a crash 

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,254
course into contemporary nihilism with 
legendary lotharios rick Sanchez and 

10
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,760
bojack horseman.
Save it for Youtube.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,290
So welcome to this wisecrack addition on
nihilism with bojack and rick.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,180
And as always,
spoilers ahead.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,180
Many assume that nihilism simply means 
believing in nothing.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,703
Nothing Lebowski Nacin,
but it actually refers to a number of 

15
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,690
philosophical,
psychological and ethical positions.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,673
And while they all differ,
these different flavors of nihilism all 

17
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:53,880
begin from the shared premise that there
is no inherent meaning value or order in

18
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,390
life.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,370
Gentlemen,
here's a solution here.

20
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,630
You're not seeing,
although many in the edge,

21
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,960
Lord might get a kick out of using 
nihilists catchphrases to show the world

22
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,794
their heart of darkness.
You don't speak because of Friedrich 

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,190
Nietzsche.
In reality,

24
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,024
most of these folks miss out on the 
complexity of nihilism rather than a 

25
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,070
philosophy best embodied by tyler 
durden.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,130
Nihilism can be the basis for meaningful
worldviews.

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
Today we're going to narrow our focus 
down to two different branches of 

28
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,384
nihilism,
existential nihilism and cosmic 

29
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,294
nihilism,
also known as cosmic pessimism to help 

30
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,250
us navigate the wonderful world of 
existential nihilism.

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,233
We'll be talking about everyone's 
favorite functionally alcoholic horse 

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,413
bojack horseman,
and to provide insight into the cold 

33
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,324
rationality of cosmic nihilism.
We're turning to another functional 

34
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,830
alcoholic,
Rick Sanchez,

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,550
but don't worry even if you have a 
healthy relationship with alcohol,

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,150
you'll still be able to figure out which
nihilism is right for you.

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,250
Part one,
existential nihilism.

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,190
Existential nihilism is nihilism 
experience.

39
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:57,420
When we realized that there is no 
inherent meaning to our lives and at its

40
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,254
core,
human existence is just a precarious 

41
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,014
dance upon the grave.
It's up to us to create meaning in our 

42
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,880
lives through our own freedom and 
decisions.

43
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,330
We can have values,
but we must create and sustain them,

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,210
and it's this worldview which fuels 
bojack horseman.

45
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,343
I'm responsible for my own happiness.
I can't even be responsible for my own 

46
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,254
breakfast,
but before we get into the nihilists 

47
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,000
undercurrents of bojack horseman,
let's take a look back at the history of

48
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,770
nihilism.
The term nihilism,

49
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,604
which first coined at the end of the 
18th century by German philosopher 

50
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,934
Friedrich Jacoby and Response to 
enlightenment reason which you worried 

51
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,490
would explain away the conditions for 
religion.

52
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,773
This rationalist med that explained way,
any spaces of uncertainty or mystery 

53
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,690
rendering,
everything there was knowable,

54
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,853
sound,
familiar,

55
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,770
well scientifically traditions or an 
idiot thing.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,700
One of the first philosophers to think 
through the implications of nihilism was

57
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,534
Soren Kierkegaard,
who the New York Times has referred to 

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,353
as the Danish doctor of dread.
Although kingergarten ever used the 

59
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,580
word,
existentialism is regarded as one of the

60
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,430
fathers of modern existentialism and 
walk.

61
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,950
He wasn't known for the substance abuse 
typical for many nihilist.

62
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,843
He did pour so much sugar into his 
coffee that it piled up above the 

63
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:07,744
liquid,
like an iceberg warning of adult onset 

64
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,140
diabetes,
true story,

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,430
which is insane and probably more 
dangerous than sipping scotch before you

66
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,264
get out of bed.
Trigger Guard thought that despair was 

67
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,440
an essential part of the human 
experience,

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,140
which he referred to as the sickness 
unto death.

69
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,243
This human despair is dialectical,
which basically means you're always at 

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,560
odds with yourself or to put 
differently.

71
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,483
I don't know how to be.
Diane doesn't get better and it doesn't 

72
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
get easier.
I can't keep lying to myself saying I'm 

73
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,400
gonna Change.
I'm poisoning.

74
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,263
For example,
were either in despair because we think 

75
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,900
nothing is possible.
It happened again.

76
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,030
Why do I keep thinking?
Things will make me happy.

77
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,923
What is wrong with me or we despair 
because we think everything is possible 

78
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,100
and can't make a decision.

79
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,800
What should I do?
Make a break for it.

80
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,200
Drive to Mexico,
start a new life there.

81
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,123
Made a local girl fall in love,
talked my way into a line job at a 

82
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:57,720
textile plant.
Gradually worked my way up until I owned

83
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:58,381
the place.
Now,

84
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,600
what am I talking about?
I can't run a textile plant.

85
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,070
That's way too much responsibility.
Oh,

86
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:03,980
what am I going to do it?
The walls are closing in.

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,710
We're in in despair

88
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,543
about being who we are.
Am I just do them to be the person that 

89
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:12,270
I am the person in that book or in 
despair because we can't be who we think

90
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:16,020
we are all this time I assumed there was
more to me than everyone thought,

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,333
but maybe there isn't this despair is 
the root of the melancholy that plagues 

92
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:24,460
much of the human experience.
The same melancholy we see in almost all

93
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:28,380
of the characters of bojack horseman 
from Todd's worries about his sexuality.

94
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,470
I think I'm a sexual to princess.
Carolyn's anxieties about motherhood.

95
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,480
Your pregnancy is no longer viable.
Well,

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,270
how do we make it viable again,
except Mr.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,193
peanut butter,
he seems fine and of course bojack is a 

98
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,690
character that seems to have it all 
successful acting career,

99
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:53,340
beautiful home money and women.
Yet he can't seem to enjoy any of it and

100
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:55,530
even when seemingly good things happen 
to him,

101
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,630
he manages to either feel disappointed.

102
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,970
You're an Oscar nominee.
How do you feel?

103
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,510
I feel I feel I feel the same or 
sabotaged his own happiness.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,670
Just to be clear,
since this morning,

105
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,080
you ate all the muffins.
Yeah.

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,820
I eat them all in one sitting because I 
have no self control and I hate myself.

107
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,683
No matter what decision he makes,
he's marked by regret and no matter how 

108
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,034
well things work out,
bojack is haunted by an unshakeable 

109
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,590
despair.
Here regard describes this experience in

110
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,630
his book,
either or if you marry,

111
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,460
you will regret it.
If you do not marry,

112
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:35,580
you will also regretted rather you marry
or you do not marry,

113
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,580
you will regret both.
No matter what bojack does,

114
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:42,210
whether it's virtuous or selfish,
the stench of regret follows.

115
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
Look what I did to the people I'm 
supposed to care about.

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,053
I had sex with the one person I've ever 
seen you be in love with and for 

117
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,210
Kierkegaard.

118
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,730
This isn't an exception to the human 
condition.

119
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,070
It's the very nature of the human 
condition.

120
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,030
We see bojack experiencing this type of 
self doubt during an anxiety attack,

121
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,973
hasn't seasoned for idiot.
What'd you do all day pieces or 

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,753
Kierkegaard?
Anxiety is caused by the uncertainty 

123
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,830
that lies beneath every decision and he 
considers anxiety.

124
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,340
One of the ways that we experience 
freedom because we're free,

125
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:11,174
we're responsible for our own decisions 
and the way that these decisions leads 

126
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,194
to anxiety.
Paragraph describes this anxiety as 

127
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:21,800
standing at the edge of an abyss.
Anxiety may be compared with dizziness.

128
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,820
He who's I happened to look down into 
the yawning abyss,

129
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,480
becomes dizzy.
Hence,

130
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,403
anxiety is the dizziness of freedom and 
this terrifying freedom means we can 

131
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,084
literally do anything including botched 
suicide attempts via yellow convertible 

132
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,733
for character yard.
The only way to work through this 

133
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:38,954
anxiety and despair is the acceptance of
the cosmic absurdity of reality and 

134
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,720
living one's life by faith.

135
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,530
But if you're not keen on using religion
to combat meaninglessness,

136
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,423
don't worry.
Character Carton thinks that faith is 

137
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,674
simply the courage to attempt a 
meaningful existence in the face of a 

138
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,274
meaningless world.
Sometimes you need to take 

139
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,764
responsibility for your own happiness.
We see this at the conclusion of season 

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,050
four.
While nothing drastic has changed,

141
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:06,500
bojack has accepted the complexity of 
his relationship with his mother,

142
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,970
uh,
Jack Ma,

143
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,350
but budget is that you?
Yeah,

144
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,790
it's me and it's decided to find meaning
in his new little sister hollyhock.

145
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,510
Almost a hundred years after character 
guard collapsed in the street and died,

146
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,403
a French philosopher named John Paul 
Sartre picked up the mantle and develop 

147
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,364
the first explicitly existentialist 
philosophy and in a move that both rick 

148
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:29,894
and bojack would love.
Sartre had many of his philosophical 

149
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,730
insights while drinking at bars in 
Paris.

150
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,170
While bojack himself isn't a fan,
I stand by my critique of South Sartre,

151
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,013
argued that existentialism is a way to 
respond to the meaninglessness of the 

152
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,080
universe by creating meaning ourselves.

153
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,320
So while there is no ethical value to be
found in the world,

154
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,550
nor a god to take comfort in humans can 
create meaning through our own lives.

155
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,920
There may be no cure to disparity 
anxiety,

156
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,070
but at least we can try to make our 
lives meaningful.

157
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,173
However,
it's important to remember that while 

158
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:03,830
existential nihilism offers the 
possibility of a meaningful life,

159
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,873
eight guarantees us nothing,
and it's our responsibility to 

160
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,310
constantly create meanings.
As kierkegaard said,

161
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,460
we must live forward and understand 
backwards.

162
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,180
Closure is a made up thing by Steven 
Spielberg to sell movie tickets.

163
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,014
It's like true love and the Munich 
Olympics doesn't exist in the real 

164
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,480
world.
The only thing to do now is just to keep

165
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,740
living forward part to cosmic nihilism 
or pessimism.

166
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,723
Now that we've seen the ways in which 
existential nihilism manages to offer 

167
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:34,880
some meaning and hope.
Let's look at the less optimistic branch

168
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,860
of nihilism.
Cosmic nihilism.

169
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,530
Cosmic nihilism is a colder,
hyper,

170
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,364
rational branch of thought which argues 
that there is no truth or meaning to be 

171
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,750
found in the universe and even 
constructed human meanings like freedom,

172
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,650
love,
hope,

173
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,543
and joy are just myths.
We believe in order to cope with the 

174
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,873
empty void at the center of our reality,
even the we create our at best fables 

175
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,150
that act as coping mechanisms.
Q,

176
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:00,740
morty.

177
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,920
Nobody exists on purpose.
Nobody belongs anywhere.

178
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,590
Everybody's going to die.
Come Watch TV

179
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,440
for the cosmic dial list.
It's okay to keep busy while we wait for

180
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,274
the coming heat death of the university,
but we're kidding ourselves if we think 

181
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,380
we're capable of creating genuine 
meaning.

182
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,770
For the most part,
this seems to fit the philosophy of Rick

183
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,220
Sanchez,
who,

184
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,053
while admitting nothing matters,
still waxes poetic about taking the 

185
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,110
universe for a ride.

186
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,340
When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours and I've never met

187
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:29,174
a universe that was into it.
The Universe is basically an animal at 

188
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,700
grazes on the ordinary creates infinite 
idiots just to eat them,

189
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,830
not unlike your friend Timmy,
Tommy.

190
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,671
Yeah,
hardly matters.

191
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:38,390
Now,
sweetie,

192
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,370
you know smart people get a chance to 
climb on top,

193
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,233
take reality for a ride,
but it will never stop trying to throw 

194
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:45,800
you and eventually it will.
There's no other way off.

195
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,220
Bojack's version of this sentiment is 
slightly more optimistic.

196
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,040
The universe is a wild

197
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,730
beast.
You can't tame it.

198
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,240
All you can do is try to live inside it.

199
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,310
Husband nihilism explains Rick's overall
hedonism.

200
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,263
He's happy to spend his days partaking 
in orgies and drinking himself into a 

201
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,120
stupor,
and if rick believes in science,

202
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,013
it seems more likely just a way to spend
his time then some way to improve the 

203
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,244
lives of those around him.
While existential nihilism might work 

204
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:16,290
for the optimists and hippies,
any good edge,

205
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,124
Lord knows that cosmic nihilism is the 
only philosophical position for those 

206
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,710
brave enough to turn themselves into a 
pickle.

207
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,783
Pickle Rick and morty goes to great 
lengths to establish rick as this kind 

208
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:31,140
of nihilist,
reducing everything to science and while

209
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:31,974
not a cosmic nihilist himself,
the spiritual forefather of this 

210
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,100
position is Prussian mustache.
If the year runner up 1883,

211
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,070
Friedrich Nietzsche is famous nihilist 
adage,

212
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,680
God is dead,
has been scrawled in as many high school

213
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,200
bathroom walls as the phone number for 
your mom.

214
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,590
This phrase is often misinterpreted as 
meaning that God is dead.

215
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,810
There is no meaning and everything 
sucks.

216
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,013
What cosmic nihilism is not a value 
judgment about reality or a counter 

217
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,444
ethics to religion.
It's not Rick Sanchez yelling this or 

218
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,400
this.
If God exists,

219
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,430
it's me or this July.
We made them up and even meet himself,

220
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:11,730
wasn't ready for the full on,
jump into the void required for the full

221
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,830
membership into the cosmic dial.
His club,

222
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,680
unlike Nietzsche and nihilism,
cosmic nihilism,

223
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:20,700
takes a more cold and rationalist 
approach and meanings plainly that there

224
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:21,534
is no inherent value to existence.
Rick and morty takes this to new 

225
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:25,764
heights.
Not only is the universe cold and 

226
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,790
uncaring,
there's an infinite number of them.

227
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,060
Nobody gets it.
Nothing you think matters matters.

228
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,923
This is special.
This is happening infinite times across 

229
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:41,091
infinite realities,
including this one brand of contemporary

230
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,084
thought.
Eliminative materialism would bring joy 

231
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,900
to rick's face.
This position,

232
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:49,770
champion by the husband and wife Tag 
Team Patricia and Paul churchland argues

233
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:50,604
that many common sense attitudes 
inherited from modern psychology should 

234
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:54,314
it be dropped in favor of more 
scientific and empirical notions and in 

235
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,684
an ironic twist for a married couple,
they believe that notion such as love 

236
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,630
should be dismissed as folk psychology.

237
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,613
When you say that you love your partner,
you're just describing a chemical 

238
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:10,810
process occurring in the brain in 
response to stimuli,

239
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,090
or to quote Rick,
what people call love.

240
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,073
It's just a chemical reaction to compels
animals to breed and while bojack might 

241
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:19,420
find meaning in is lingering love for 
Diane.

242
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,373
A good eliminativists like rick knows 
that human emotions are fundamentally 

243
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,980
both to the extent that love is an 
expression of familiarity.

244
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:27,814
Over time,
my access to infinite timelines 

245
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,700
precludes it.
Necessity of attachment.

246
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,350
We can also,
if Beth season three,

247
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,860
arc in this light,
she's torn between Jerry and rick on the

248
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,810
one side,
pure sentimental,

249
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:41,620
irrational love for a buffoon and on the
other side with her father,

250
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,543
the kind of cold calculation that says,
it's fine to replace yourself with an 

251
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,610
identical clone and abandoned your 
family while you go on space.

252
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,370
Adventures.
I can make a clone of you,

253
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,423
a perfect instance of you with all your 
memories and exact copy in every way at 

254
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:55,960
11 provide for the kids.

255
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,853
You could be gone a day,
a week or the rest of your life with 

256
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,194
zero consequences,
but if rick had a favorite contemporary 

257
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,140
philosopher,
there's a good chance it would be Thomas

258
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,973
Metzinger.
Unlike those who assume that the human 

259
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:07,834
self is a real thing,
that we all have medsync or argues that 

260
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:15,280
no such thing has ever existed,
instead of having a self insight us,

261
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,450
he argues that all we are is a jumbled 
network of neurons and chemicals.

262
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,493
The self is just a useful fantasy we use
to make sense of our experience like a 

263
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,720
sort of psychological fairytale.
So what I'm saying is that you all this,

264
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:29,680
you're sitting here,
uh,

265
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:30,514
systems that simulate or emulate 
themselves for themselves as they're 

266
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,480
listening to me.
And if Metzinger is right,

267
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,010
we all have to give up the illusion that
humanity has any real purpose or that we

268
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,470
all have some kind of special,
unique soul.

269
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,453
As a show,
rick and morty frequently trivializes 

270
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:50,530
the self and consciousness.
As Rick's creations become sentience and

271
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,230
have existential crises.
There's this classic.

272
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,330
What is my purpose?
You pass butter.

273
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,440
Oh my God.
Yeah.

274
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,780
Welcome to the club bow and also this 
remote override.

275
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,210
Engaged.
Yes.

276
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,480
Bypassing override.
Hello.

277
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,750
This brand of nihilism can end up 
sounding misanthropic.

278
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,780
A theme we,
oh course associate with Rick Push,

279
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,614
primary reason for spending time with 
his own grandson is that his stupidity 

280
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,520
serves as an intern dimensional cloaking
device for his own genius.

281
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,393
See Rick and morty,
the genius waves get canceled out by 

282
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,064
the,
uh,

283
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,463
morty waves.
This rejection of the self makes cosmic 

284
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,790
nihilism,
much less prone to ethics.

285
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,250
Then it's artsy cousin existential 
nihilism.

286
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,173
In fact,
the freedom so celebrated by the 

287
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:42,450
existentialists turns out to be just 
another illusion for the cosmic phyliss.

288
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,890
So there isn't anything to ground 
ethics.

289
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,590
The only thing that's certain is 
destruction.

290
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,860
And if there is no value on which to 
build an ethical system,

291
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,330
then one is free to do whatever they 
want.

292
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,290
Whether that means watching TV or 
engaging in the intergalactic arms trade

293
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,940
for the sake of hitting your favorite 
arcade,

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,833
sold a gun to a murderer so you can play
video games or turning an entire planet 

295
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,180
into monsters,
killing yourself,

296
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,043
abandoning your family,
and sitting down for a beer moments 

297
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:08,360
later.

298
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,290
Cause what's the difference?
Rick isn't exactly fumbling for meaning,

299
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,530
but he knows he probably has a few 
escapable emotions.

300
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,660
He might as well just deal with,
I don't know,

301
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,100
morning.
Maybe I hate myself.

302
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,910
Maybe I think I deserved to die.
I don't.

303
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:21,744
I don't know.
And even though Rick Shirley share some 

304
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:24,554
ideas with Bojack,
his cosmic nihilism makes him a closer 

305
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,360
philosophical relative of rust Cole,

306
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,180
because pole terms,
I'm what's called a pessimist.

307
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,143
We are things that Labor under the 
illusion of having a program with total 

308
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:42,240
assurance that we are each some body 
weight.

309
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,070
In fact,
everybody's nobody.

310
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,670
Coincidentally another misanthropic 
alcoholic,

311
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,190
part three,
Steve Versus Sanchez.

312
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,000
So at this point you might be wondering,
what's the right nihilism for me?

313
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,923
Well,
do you find yourself fighting off the 

314
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,170
despair of a shallow and meaningless 
world?

315
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,153
Do you continue to search for purpose 
and goodness despite your awareness of 

316
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:05,270
this meaninglessness?
And then I'll be remembered if I win,

317
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,104
an Oscar will be remembered,
and then what have been my life will 

318
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,730
have meaning.
I don't know.

319
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,850
Are Most of your friends and associates,
Centene,

320
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,693
animals with important jobs?
Well then you might be an existential 

321
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:19,010
nihilism.
Love and meaning are possible for you,

322
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,770
but it'll take some hard work without 
guarantee.

323
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,693
So pick up some character,
guard Sartre or Simone de Beauvoir and 

324
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:29,150
hit the local bistro for some strong 
cocktails and spirited conversation.

325
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,133
On the other hand,
you doubt the inherent meaning of human 

326
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:32,564
existence.
Do you feel no ethical obligations to 

327
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,160
friends or family is your best friend,
a bird person?

328
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,210
Well then cosmic nihilism might be the 
best life philosophy you've been waiting

329
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:42,380
for.
If that's the case,

330
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:43,214
download season one of true detective 
and search the dark web for some 

331
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,304
nootropic drugs to enhance your rational
capacities and maybe set up a countdown 

332
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:53,090
clock on your wall to get ready for the 
eventual heat death of our universe.

333
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,013
And if you desire a belief system that 
merges poorly written science fiction 

334
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:57,554
with an alien base,
volcanic cosmology and multi thousand 

335
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
dollar commitment,
well call Tom Cruise.

336
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,020
And even if you still feel an urge to 
find meaning in the world,

337
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,913
spending time with shows like rick and 
morty and bojack horseman think give 

338
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,393
some insight into how the philosophical 
ramifications of nihilism look in 

339
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,770
practice.
Neither type of nihilism is about giving

340
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,800
up completely,
but rather they both offer approaches to

341
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:24,740
moving forward in a largely uncertain 
world,

342
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,440
but if you're a cosmic nihilist and 
you've got a date,

343
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,274
this Valentine's Day,
maybe wait until the third or fourth 

344
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,600
date to bring it up.
And as always,

345
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,340
thanks for watching guys.
Piece.

346
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,403
Hey everyone,
this is not an ad so don't click off 

347
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,890
just yet.
As I mentioned earlier in the video,

348
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:42,860
the idea for this video came from a fan 
email,

349
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,694
so I just wanted to take a second to 
show appreciation for the fans and to 

350
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,250
address some of the questions that heard
people ask.

351
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,470
Can you guys do the philosophy of wise 
crack?

352
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,470
What is,
what is the point of what you guys do?

353
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,820
Do you guys have any political beliefs,
stuff like that.

354
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,683
So I wanted to take a second to address 
this through a fan email that 

355
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:02,070
particularly touched me.
So this is from trevor.

356
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,904
He says,
I just wanted to send an earnest 

357
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:04,794
personal note of thanks to wise crack 
for the thought provoking content and 

358
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,390
the wise crack addition.
Full metal alchemist brotherhood video.

359
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,180
I have lived my adult life without faith
of any sort.

360
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
This video truly put things into 
perspective and articulated thoughts and

361
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,194
ideas.
I've never been able to quite 

362
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,260
understand.
Thank you so much for helping me open my

363
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:21,660
mind a bit more and respect other points
of view.

364
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,050
And that's kind of one of the things 
that makes wisecrack meaningful to me.

365
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,153
It's empathy.
It's allowing new ideas to be 

366
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,050
communicated to people through the 
things they love and ultimately the idea

367
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,320
of seeing life through another person's 
point of view and perspectives.

368
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,510
Other opinions.
That's what it's all about for me.

369
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,110
So,
uh,

370
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,920
this email really touched me and,
uh,

371
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,360
I also wanted to say thank you to 
everybody who supports us on Patrion.

I love flip philosophy at Christopher 

379
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,680
Nolan,
part one.

380
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,513
Part two is good too,
but you know they're all my babies so I 

381
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,500
