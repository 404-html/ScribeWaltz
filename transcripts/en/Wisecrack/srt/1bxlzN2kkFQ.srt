1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,873
Problem with his papers is craigslist.
This guy named Craig sets up a mailing 

2
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:20,051
list and craigslist.org.
It's the ugliest site you've ever seen.

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,063
And if you want to get a couch unloaded,
that's where you go instead of the 

4
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:25,814
classifieds.
Now the idea that somehow we owe it to 

5
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,444
newspapers in order to get decent 
reportage and have a New York Times 

6
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:32,744
Baghdad bureau to subsidize them by not 
allowing craigslist to exist so that we 

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,290
still have to go through them to place 
our classifieds.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,593
Ridiculous enough notion that it's no 
doubt a straw man and nobody would ever 

9
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:45,770
say such a thing.
Um,

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,220
so newspapers do have a problem in that 
what they have to offer and what many of

11
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:54,584
us think is a good thing that they do,
unbiased reporting and professional 

12
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:02,711
journalism seems to be a substitutable 
product with cats,

13
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:03,674
flushing toilets on youtube.
And so long as that's the case and 

14
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:07,940
people are like,
hmm,

15
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,660
news about a rock kept flushing toilet,
I'd watch either of them.

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,270
So long as the cat flushing the toilet 
is cheaper,

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,290
that's going to have more supply and 
that's where the demand will go.

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,573
So what we're really complaining about 
is the fact that there's some ethos and 

19
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:23,564
profession of journalism that has been 
subject to high pressure market forces 

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,950
that are driving it out.
To me,

21
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:31,784
the real solution there,
if we think the news is valuable and 

22
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,190
there isn't the market framework to 
support it,

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,310
you subsidize it.
It's how you get NPR.

24
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,144
It's how you get pbs because you think 
yet another channel of I dream of 

25
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,400
Jeannie reruns,
even though that's pound for pound,

26
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,550
what earns more money for the channel 
operator?

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,480
Then Pvs,
we'd rather have pbs in the mix too,

28
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,090
and we're prepared to see what we can do
to make it happen.
