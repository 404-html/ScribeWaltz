1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,763
Very Pale flesh again.
So we watched Netflix is new death note 

2
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:10,560
movie this weekend and thought it 
merited some discussion.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,483
And of course some spoilers.
If you watched our video on the death 

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,024
note anime a couple of weeks ago,
you know that we're big fans of the 

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,430
show,
draws out incredibly nuanced ideas about

6
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,080
the nature of justice,
justice,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,430
justice,
justice,

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,500
justice,
justice,

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,543
and even participates in it's own 
philosophical dialogue throughout the 

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,920
series.
It's just damn good television,

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,600
the movie.
Well,

12
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,290
it's not exactly good cinema.
Now,

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,124
off the bat,
I just want to say that adapting at 37 

14
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:42,570
episode animate to a single movie is 
really,

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,240
really hard.
If someone hired me to do that,

16
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,074
I'd be in my pants.
So we're not here to grade how closely 

17
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,880
the new film sticks to the anime or the 
Monga.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,270
It's an adaptation and it deserves some 
room to do its own thing.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
So let's look at the film on its own 
terms.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,460
It's definitely got some good things 
going for it.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,540
And the thing that I most admire is its 
attempt to preserve some of the thematic

22
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,374
richness of the anime,
which is an impressive goal for a 100 

23
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:11,220
minute movie that already packs in a lot
action sequences,

24
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,054
detective games,
Gore and teen romance from lights 

25
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,610
argument that his systematic cheating is
no big deal.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,940
I'm looking at homework here for at 
least 15 different students.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,050
All right,
I get it.

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,913
I'm in trouble.
All I'm trying to say is you have the 

29
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,820
chance to stop the type of people who 
make things hard for everybody.

30
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:27,654
You've got to see the big picture here 
to his conversation with his dad at the 

31
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,714
end.
Death note tries to put some moral 

32
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,050
ambiguity into lights,
character,

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,230
and gesture to bigger questions about 
the nature of good and evil.

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,663
Given the time constraints.
He was smart not to attempt the massive 

35
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,070
discourses on justice that we see in the
anime,

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,233
but the film makes clear that it's still
interested in ethics just in a 

37
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,430
simplified form.
Exactly.

38
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:54,760
Can I do with this death now and see 
what happens?

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,673
Unfortunately,
that's where the film gets itself into 

40
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,070
trouble.
Toward the beginning.

41
00:01:59,071 --> 00:01:59,904
Mr.
Turner tells light guns is only as good 

42
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:06,050
as the Jameson I make sure people can 
trust are here.

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,893
Of course,
he's talking about the role of the 

44
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:08,664
Seattle police,
but light seems to adopt a similar 

45
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,960
principle using the power of the death 
note.

46
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,794
He liked his animate counterpart wants 
to create a new world where innocent 

47
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,550
civilians are protected from the people 
who make life miserable.

48
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,000
The death note is his gun and that's the
aim.

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,570
Although he gets squeamish about 
offering some law enforcement,

50
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,690
we never really see light compromising 
the intentions behind that aim until his

51
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,550
David Copperfield reveal at the end of 
the film.

52
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,503
Instead they bring in a seductive power 
hungry girlfriend to play the role of 

53
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,004
bad cop.
For 90% of the movie light is 

54
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,183
unambiguously the good guy,
or at least be kind of okay guy and 

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,833
that's a problem.
Kira largely had the support of the 

56
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:56,241
people including the police until the 
death of the FBI team and who sent eight

57
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,564
federal agents walking off a building.
The duplicitous mia who stole the 

58
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,190
notebook from light and wrote his name 
in it,

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,450
bad,
bad me.

60
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,730
Who killed what tare by not burning the 
page with his name on it.

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,433
We're clearly supposed to blame me up 
even though light put it there in the 

62
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:16,440
first place.
Although the film spends next to no time

63
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:18,750
developing what light wants out of his 
new world,

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,763
he's still shockingly quick to abandon 
and once someone dies who hasn't 

65
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,680
committed a felony or stolen someone's 
lunch money,

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,350
you really think people are going to be 
on their needs.

67
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,480
If you can talk to her like that.
We're not killing my dad mia.

68
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,210
This is overview just we're not the good
guys anymore.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,200
We aren't the good guys anymore.
Sounds a lot more like people don't like

70
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,034
us.
Then an actual statement about cure is 

71
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,140
morality of rule and while the third act
of the film tries to play up,

72
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:42,974
the difference between lights,
reluctance to kill people and bad meals 

73
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:46,754
bloodthirstiness lights,
shifts seems more pragmatic than 

74
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:50,564
anything.
Lights change of perspective isn't an 

75
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,690
indication that there was ever problems 
with his plan for becoming a God.

76
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,853
Just that the circumstances have changed
and he doesn't really want to go to 

77
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:01,304
prison,
but mia doesn't really mind if a gun is 

78
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:04,814
only as good as its aim.
It seems like the film should be asking 

79
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,830
questions about lights,
aim with the death note,

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,060
but instead of saying be careful of 
aiming your gun in this direction,

81
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,163
it's more make sure your crazy 
girlfriend doesn't get ahold of your 

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,050
gun.
Okay.

83
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,700
L's quick personality flip from,
I don't kill,

84
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:24,534
I just bring justice to I might kill you
in the same way you killed hundreds of 

85
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,810
people seems to be totally dependent on 
circumstance.

86
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,793
The detective strong moral framework 
developed since childhood gets tossed 

87
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,770
away instantly when his friend goes 
missing,

88
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,490
but there's no emphasis on the 
significance of that change.

89
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,160
Light ends the film by telling his dad,

90
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,120
first I was just going to kill all the 
bad guys and good guys.

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,130
Sometimes you got to choose the lesser 
of the two years,

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,320
but what are these two evils?
My guess is that not even light notes,

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,450
unlike the animate.
I know,

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,710
sorry,
I had to say it.

95
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,933
Death notes.
Ethical ambiguity is less about opening 

96
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:14,540
a multitude of possibilities and more 
about shrugging in the direction of good

97
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,970
and evil while ultimately saying nothing

98
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,333
interesting.

99
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,390
Now,
once again,

100
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,253
condensing an animate of that magnitude 
into a relatively short film is a 

101
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:34,610
difficult task and I won't begrudge the 
filmmakers some reductions in depth,

102
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,713
but what the story clone to most 
hutchins about good and evil was poorly 

103
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:40,514
executed and ended up hamstringing its 
potential both philosophically and 

104
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:45,740
dramatically.
Anyway,

105
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:46,574
those are our thoughts.
We're still experimenting with this new 

106
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:49,424
quick take format,
so if you have thoughts on what we 

107
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:53,480
should cover next,
let us know these guys.

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,140
If you're looking for more wise crack 
quick takes on the latest,

109
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,870
be sure to check out our rick and Morty 
podcasts,

110
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,704
the squatch where we break down every 
single new episode and you could find 

111
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,500
all this in the description to catch you
all next time.
