1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Mm,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,410
so when you're.
We're fascinated with your election,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,960
hillary and trump,
goodness,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,960
and everybody that you talk to says,
well,

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,153
how is trump being so successful?
Why on earth are people tolerating 

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,930
sexist,
racist,

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,370
hate speech,
and there was a good answer for it.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,893
I wrote a piece recently for time and I 
discussed why trump is having the sort 

9
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:46,371
of success that he's having at the 
moment and it comes down to one thing.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,790
Trump is a troll that has jumped off the
internet and into the real world and the

11
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:55,524
reason that so many people are tolerant 
of his extreme statements is name 

12
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,734
calling this horrible,
nasty even stood sadistic behavior is 

13
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,681
because the online environment has 
normalized this type of behavior

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,033
in cyber psychology.
We pointed out that what happens in the 

15
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,244
cyber world impacts on the real world.
What happens in the real world impacts 

16
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,893
on the cyber world,
and this is certainly true in terms of 

17
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,810
trump's behavior.
There's a great study titled Trolls.

18
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,653
Just want to have fun and you should 
read this because it talks about the 

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,980
dark tetrad of personality.
The study found that people who say that

20
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,434
they like to troll actually score high 
on an an index that measures 

21
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,483
machiavellianism and index that measures
psychopathic traits and index that 

22
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,000
measures narcissistic traits and say 
doesn't,

23
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,540
and the study found that trolling was a 
manifestation of everyday sadism.

24
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,310
And election aside,
I know it's important,

25
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,430
but I'm more concerned about a bigger 
issue.

26
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,300
The issue is that people like me spend 
our time trying to teach kids to be nice

27
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,234
to each other online,
but it's very hard for us to win that 

28
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:34,584
battle when politicians use cruelty and 
sadism as a strategy and appear to gain 

29
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,800
ground because of it.

30
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,390
So cyberspace is an environment.
It's somewhere where you go.

31
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,270
It's an immersive environment chatroom 
forum.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,313
It's a place.
And what happens there is that behavior 

33
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:00,100
can become normalized.
So as human beings,

34
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,660
we're social creatures and we learn from
others.

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,670
So for peers that everybody is doing 
something,

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,880
it can seem that it's okay and it's 
become very difficult with the pervasive

37
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,514
penetration and accessibility of the 
Internet to draw the line between 

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
something that's in evolving behavior 
and that's become almost a social norm.

39
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,103
And sadly,
online trolling has become almost a 

40
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:30,994
social norm.
The problem is when that behavior cyber 

41
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,094
migrates into the real world and trump 
and the way he behaves is a classic 

42
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,990
example of cyber like ration.
