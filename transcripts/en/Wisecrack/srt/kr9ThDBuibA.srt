1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,783
Hey,
why is cracked so over the years you 

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,660
guys know it's been our mission to use 
the lens of philosophy,

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:08,494
literature,
and the humanities to achieve a greater 

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:13,870
appreciation of art and hopefully to 
enrich people's lives,

5
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:15,400
but today we're doing something a little
bit different.

6
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:18,230
This is ground zero of science content 
on wisecracking.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,123
For that I decided to bring on someone 
who's a lot smarter than I am when it 

8
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:22,930
comes to science.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,540
Helen.
Hey guys.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,843
So today we are starting with a wise 
crack favorite to see if we can connect 

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,624
some of the philosophical themes that we
talk about with existing research and 

12
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,400
neuroscience,
biology and psychology.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,740
So today we're starting with one punch 
man.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,960
Also want to give a quick shout out to 
brilliant.org

15
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,820
for sponsoring this video.
Thank you guys.

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,680
So anyway,
I'm gonna.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,790
Give it over to Helen.

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,840
Wait,
so is it hey wise crack Helen here.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,190
So it would be.
Hey wisecrack held here.

20
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:52,420
You got to go.
It's one,

21
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:53,171
two,
three up,

22
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:53,830
down.

23
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,210
Hey.
Wise crack.

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,220
Helen here.
There we go.

25
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:58,660
Now say it faster.
Hey.

26
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,510
Wise,
crack Helen here and today we're putting

27
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:05,590
the boldest bad ass in the universe 
under the microscope in one punch,

28
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,930
man.
Our protagonists site trauma is a salary

29
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:08,764
man turned hero who possesses no special
powers apart from the strength he's 

30
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,290
gained through his intense training 
regimen.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,333
100 pushups,
100 sit ups and 100 squats that a 10 

32
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,170
kilometer run.
Do it every single day,

33
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,620
and now he can defeat every enemy with a
single punch.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,880
Sounds cool,
right?

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,893
Well,
this lack of challenge leave site to my 

36
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,860
board,
detached and unfulfilled.

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,573
Oh they took was one punch.
Dreaming of becoming the best at 

38
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,760
anything is pretty much being human one 
on one,

39
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,743
but the site is dilemma.
Reflect our growing scientific 

40
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,700
understanding of how humans can live a 
satisfying life.

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,773
Welcome to this special wise crack 
condition on the science of one punch 

42
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,280
man,
and as always,

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,173
spoilers ahead with no real challenge.
Cytoma loses his enthusiasm for battle 

44
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,280
much to the irritation of his rivals.
He blows them off.

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,650
Repairs to witness the true power.

46
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,500
I got dirt and my special pans place.
Hey,

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,060
are you even listening?
Insults them.

48
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,923
What a let down.
I was pretty excited to see the battle 

49
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:16,864
suits I'd been hearing about,
but the design is pretty lame and all 

50
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:20,344
they do is give you superhuman strength 
and occasionally has the audacity to 

51
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:24,814
yawn during a fight.
Does that really seem like sysomos 

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,560
enjoying himself?
As we've mentioned before,

53
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,543
philosophers like Masa Hero Morioka have
argued that challenge is a necessary 

54
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:34,774
component of a meaningful life,
and then as our lives become more 

55
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,550
efficient and therefore less 
challenging,

56
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,500
our mental health pays the price

57
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,250
we will continue to ride until food,
clothing,

58
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:47,520
and shelter are provided free of charge.
To those who do not work

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,543
sounds pretty boring.
It turns out this isn't just 

60
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,020
philosophical.
Grandstanding science suggests there's a

61
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:57,250
biological basis for the idea.
The challenging ourselves is good for us

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,740
and it's not just our mental health 
that's at stake.

63
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,230
If we always take it easy.
Neuroscientists,

64
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,064
Dr.
Mark Madsen argues that the 

65
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
pervasiveness of what he calls 
unchallenging lifestyles prevents us 

66
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:10,060
from activating adaptive stress 
responses.

67
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,103
A series of changes that take place at 
the cellular level when an organism is 

68
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,630
exposed to danger.
Here's how it works.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,673
Let's say you're walking down the alley.
When you encounter a giant Kelp and 

70
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,514
crusted monster,
your brain activates your sympathetic 

71
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,544
nervous system or the part of the 
nervous system that turns on the fight 

72
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,024
or flight response by sending out a 
molecule from the hypothalamus and 

73
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,310
almond shaped area toward the center of 
the brain.

74
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,413
This molecule tells the pituitary gland 
to send out another molecule which sets 

75
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,960
off a series of reactions in the adrenal
gland above the kidneys.

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,560
That ultimately leads to the release of 
a substance called Cortisol,

77
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,603
Aka the stress hormone.
It's nickname comes from the fact that 

78
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,950
it's the main hormone involved in the 
stress response,

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,873
and while there's always a certain 
baseline amount circulating through the 

80
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,020
bloodstream,
those levels increase.

81
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,730
When your fight or flight response turns
up,

82
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,803
that extra quarters all prompts your 
body to do things like break down sugar 

83
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
to give you energy and numb the pain 
response so you'd be more likely to 

84
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,284
fight through an injury.
It also turns down the part of your 

85
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,780
immune system that fights off viruses 
and certain kinds of bacteria.

86
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,883
This isn't a bad thing.
The idea is to push the energy you need 

87
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,920
to fight infection to other more 
important tasks that'll help you survive

88
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,950
and immediate threat.
If this happens now and then it works,

89
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:24,280
kind of like endurance training,
your body learns how to respond to acute

90
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,860
stress more efficiently,
but if it's constant,

91
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,783
you can wind up with a botched immune 
system as your body becomes less 

92
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,294
sensitive to cortisol.
That can lead to chronic inflammation 

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,730
because there's nothing stopping your 
immune system from running on high,

94
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,370
which can lead to a host of other health
problems.

95
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,650
We might consider dominator of the 
universe,

96
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,484
Lord boroughs,
as an exaggerated metaphor for this 

97
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:44,860
process,

98
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,693
my species,
what the struggle for survival amid the 

99
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,210
harsh environment of our home 
repossessed,

100
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,380
the ultimate in regenerative ability

101
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,990
are you able to regrow entire limbs is a
pretty potent adaptive stress response.

102
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,270
A lot of the nuts,
so fictional starfish,

103
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,283
a well known limb regenerator Yep.
Burrells also points out that the 

104
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:04,854
extreme strength he exudes and battle is
so taxing that it actually shortens his 

105
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:10,200
life if he uses it.
Too often.

106
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,860
Doing this place is enormous stress on 
my body.

107
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,430
Similar to anaerobic exercise,
as a result,

108
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,450
it's Jordan's my life,
the same

109
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,283
problem humans run into when our fight 
or flight response goes into overdrive 

110
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,004
for too long.
Scientists like Dr Mattson say humans 

111
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,034
are evolutionarily adapted to deal with 
environmental challenges and then not 

112
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:30,114
having them on a regular basis,
mainly in the form of not enough 

113
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,084
physical exertion or too little exposure
to the natural toxins found in plants 

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,013
can lead to the prolonged inflammatory 
states that have been linked to 

115
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,550
everything from Alzheimer's to diabetes 
to cancer.

116
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,380
Inflammation causes changes in DNA and 
since DNA contains the code for creating

117
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,214
all the proteins in your body,
Wonky DNA can result in misshape and 

118
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:50,874
proteins.
Those can go on to screw up hormone 

119
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,320
regulation and encourage out of control 
cell growth.

120
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,303
In other words,
cancer from Dr Matson's perspective 

121
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
without challenges,
your body isn't given opportunities to 

122
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,510
strengthen its defenses that is improved
the adoptive stress response,

123
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,810
so when something starts to go wrong,
it has a hard time fixing it.

124
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,883
Outside of the physical effects,
a lack of conflict introduces a similar 

125
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,604
logic.
Operates psychologically will cite them 

126
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:16,234
or may not be getting diabetes.
He's probably got some issues going on 

127
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,264
in his brain parts through the show.
We can see how enduring challenges can 

128
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,750
make you more mentally resilient.
Let's take genos.

129
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,763
He's faced certain challenges that to 
hasn't faced on what we know from the 

130
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,394
show site has had it pretty easy.
He didn't get into the crime fighting 

131
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,084
business to avenge the death of his 
family or bring justice to the 

132
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,120
oppressed.
He just did it for fun fast one.

133
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,490
Who are you?
Just a guy who's a hero for fun.

134
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,473
On the other hand,
genesis backstory is much more 

135
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:47,174
traumatic.
He witnessed the destruction of his 

136
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:52,340
hometown and the death of his family at 
the hands of an out of Control Cyborg.

137
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,313
We lived a peaceful and happy life 
together until that fateful day when a 

138
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,350
crazy cyborg went out of control and 
attacked our town.

139
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
His experience mirrors that of many 
other characters in the genre.

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,010
Gods from Berzerk Aaron from attack on 
Titan Naruto.

141
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,340
A painful childhood is a common 
denominator throughout anime,

142
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,203
Manga and comics in general.
So how did these experiences shape the 

143
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,870
characters?
Well,

144
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:15,704
it's pretty complex and often a little 
stuck on one hand their struggles 

145
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,354
motivate them or at the very least seem 
to give them the strength to withstand 

146
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,750
extremely difficult circumstances.
Psychology backs this up.

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,673
A growing body of research suggests that
some people who go through adverse or 

148
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:31,694
traumatic experiences as kids are in 
some ways more resilient than those 

149
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,100
whose childhoods were relatively 
carefree.

150
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,083
For instance,
some individuals who grow up in high 

151
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,274
stress environments develop unique 
problem solving skills and are better 

152
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:45,890
able to deal with uncertainty and their 
peers who had it easier.

153
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,143
Of course,
that doesn't change the fact that there 

154
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,544
are loads of other issues associated 
with having a rough childhood like 

155
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,174
problems with learning and memory and a 
propensity for being emotionally 

156
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:58,940
reactive and there are caveats to the 
whole what doesn't kill you,

157
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:02,990
makes you stronger idea to research on 
adults has indicated that those who face

158
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:03,824
the medium number of challenging life 
events like the death of a loved one or 

159
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:07,664
financial difficulties or better able to
cope with worry and stress than those 

160
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,204
who deal with either an unusually low or
an unusually high number of such 

161
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:14,900
experiences.

162
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,210
It sort of like the goldilocks 
principle.

163
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,080
Optimal adaptation distress is achieved 
from not having too much exposure,

164
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,240
but not too little either.
In theory,

165
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,163
general says,
traumatic experiences may have boosted 

166
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:28,790
his ability to handle the emotional 
whiplash of hero work.

167
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,830
There'll being a cyborg definitely 
helps.

168
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,420
He fights to near death in battle and 
shows up when others don't like when the

169
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,254
s class heroes are called in to hold off
the media that threatens to wipe out 

170
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:40,490
cities eat.
Meanwhile,

171
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,393
Cytoma meanders through life.
He can't even try to swat a mosquito 

172
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:47,390
without losing it.
Additionally,

173
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,090
having something to strive for the 
coming is powerful.

174
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,650
SSNC gives genesis work,
meaning a stark contrast with Cytoma who

175
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,220
was already at the top of his game.

176
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,770
I'd always dreamed of becoming some,
what is this?

177
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,503
What's wrong with me?
Why does my heart feel so lifeless and 

178
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:06,710
empty?

179
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,543
What site to be more satisfied if he had
something more meaningful to work 

180
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:11,690
towards.
Then some bs,

181
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:12,524
superhero classification,
and what's the purpose of having a 

182
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,840
purpose anyway?
Is there some kind of biological benefit

183
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,540
to leading a meaningful life?
Back in 2008,

184
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,530
team of researchers published a study on
the Japanese concept of picky guy,

185
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,040
which roughly translates to a reason for
being in it.

186
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,980
They asked 43,000
people a simple question,

187
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,030
do you have achy guide in your life?
By the end of the seven year long study,

188
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,960
roughly 95 percent of those who 
reporting having a sense of icky guy,

189
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:43,130
we're still alive compared to only 83 
percent of those who said they did not,

190
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,120
regardless of socioeconomic status,
psychological factors,

191
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,890
lifestyle,
or history of illness,

192
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,813
the increased mortality risk remained.
Most of those who died without a sense 

193
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:55,130
that they could guide did so as a result
of heart disease,

194
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,053
mainly strokes for context.
A link between heart disease and a lack 

195
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:01,220
of purpose has shown up consistently in 
other studies.

196
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,293
Uh,
2015 roundup of Japanese and American 

197
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:04,544
research on the topic been reduced heart
disease and those who reported having a 

198
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:07,784
sense of meaning in life.
Unlike the villains in the series who 

199
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:13,310
often have rather legitimate reasons for
wanting to destroy humanity

200
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,410
in order to wipe out humanity.
Medieval civilization surface given bond

201
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,430
Cytoma

202
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,290
is still unsure of is icky guy.
How do you even have purpose when you've

203
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,020
achieved what people like Genos can only
dream of is aimless existence,

204
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,270
leaves him prone to depression,
irritability,

205
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:33,104
and melancholy.
Fluoros has struggled to find his icky 

206
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:39,050
guy to his purpose in life was to 
destroy one world after the next what?

207
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:42,320
After growing so strong that he no 
longer had worthy adversaries,

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,260
he found himself board and apathetic a 
car,

209
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:48,740
told him he could find the opponent that
would reignite his passion for battle,

210
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,450
so he's been traveling for 20 years to 
find one when he encounters cytoma.

211
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,593
In a sense sight.
Tma Is [inaudible] ag guy and give 

212
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,524
stimulation to my existence.
Scientists for years have postulated a 

213
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:04,100
relationship between purpose,
life satisfaction and resilience.

214
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,870
Back in 1946,
Dr.

215
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,780
Viktor Frankl,
a psychiatrist,

216
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,653
neurologist,
and Holocaust survivor suggested that 

217
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,650
the societal ills of aggression,
addiction,

218
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,484
and depression stemmed from an 
existential vacuum or the idea that 

219
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:19,550
one's life and work much purpose in his 
book.

220
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,000
Man's search for meaning.
He describes the psychological impact of

221
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:23,834
daily life in a Nazi concentration camp.
He knows that the prisoners who clung 

222
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,004
onto a sense of purpose,
we're the ones most likely to survive 

223
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,320
writing life has never made unbearable 
by circumstances,

224
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,620
but only by lack of meaning and purpose.
Since then,

225
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,513
we've seen over and over again that 
having no sense of meaning in life is 

226
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,620
associated with a higher risk of 
addiction,

227
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,110
anxiety and depression.
On the flip side,

228
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,070
having a sense of purpose is associated 
with lower incidents of these issues.

229
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,113
If challenging one's self is key to 
finding purpose in life and having sort 

230
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,244
of purpose is necessary for optimal 
psychological and perhaps even physical 

231
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,234
health can,
we can see why having virtually no 

232
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:00,424
competition leave site to a miserable,
challenging ourselves can help us find 

233
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:06,220
that meaning and improves our wellbeing 
in other ways too,

234
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,353
and in some cases even the hardships we 
can't control can make us more 

235
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:10,954
resilient,
which suggests there might be a 

236
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,980
psychological benefit to seeing them as 
an opportunity for growth.

237
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,130
So we'll cite them to ever be presented 
with a real challenge.

238
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,053
I wonder if taking out this guy will 
count as work and if he does will it 

239
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,470
gives him a much needed sense of 
passion.

240
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,940
We'll just have to wait until season two
whenever that is to find out and just to

241
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:31,060
make sure you're being challenged.
I'm going to put my money where my mouth

242
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:34,360
is and give you a brain teaser courtesy 
of brilliant.org.

243
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,480
Imagine you're presented with five 
chocolates to choose from,

244
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,230
one of which is poison.
You alternate turns with an opponent and

245
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,064
during each turn,
the current player must choose whether 

246
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,210
to eat one or two of the remaining 
chocolates.

247
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,880
The player who eats the poisoned 
chocolate uses.

248
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,103
If you're the first player,
what moves should you make each turn to 

249
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:56,170
when to find out the solution and to 
find more awesome logic puzzles.

Personally,

254
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,280
I love the calculus module,
which is a miracle because,

255
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,480
well,
it's calculus,

256
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,730
but brilliant actually made it fun.

Banks.
Helen,

266
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,770
I just wanted to say that that's enough.
See you guys around.
