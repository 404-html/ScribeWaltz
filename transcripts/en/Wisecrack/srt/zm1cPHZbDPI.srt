00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,993
Hey wisecrack,
jared here would be imminent release of 

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,754
the avengers infinity war.
We thought we'd go back and take a look 

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,880
at the civil war.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,510
Nope,

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,650
not that one.
This one

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,490
now

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,323
on its face,
civil war is a two hour spectacle of 

10
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,054
biceps chases,
mandatory character introductions to 

11
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:29,590
feed the mcu and man,
you know,

12
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:30,424
he lifts,
but in addition to some good old 

13
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:32,794
fashioned fisticuffs civil war also 
explores the idea of global fisticuffs 

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,890
or international relations as you may 
know it.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,873
Which brings us to the question,
what do superpowers like the United 

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,190
States have to learn from Tony Stark or 
Steve Rogers?

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,323
Welcome to this wisecrack condition on 
the philosophy of Captain America civil 

18
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,440
war.
Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't

19
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,274
already and has always spoilers ahead.
While the civil war comics Uris deals 

20
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,840
with issues like privacy and domestic 
policing in the wake of the Patriot Act,

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,900
the film makes an ambitious break with 
its source material.

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,853
Instead,
it focuses on a conflict between two 

23
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,750
approaches to international relations,
civil war frames.

24
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,584
The conflict between Captain America and
iron man is a battle between two 

25
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,900
opposing views on the avengers role in 
the world.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,490
Specifically,
the film asks,

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,383
should a US based high powered and 
potentially destructive team like the 

28
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:20,344
avengers be allowed to operate 
internationally independent of 

29
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:26,260
government oversight?
It's a poignant question to ask,

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,183
especially in the wake of America's own 
questioning of its interventionism 

31
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,454
abroad in civil war.
This question comes to a head in the 

32
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:33,364
debate over the Sokovia accords.
The accords claim the avengers have no 

33
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:39,100
right to cross national borders and 
fight.

34
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:39,934
They're highly destructive battles 
without the approval of all governments 

35
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,980
concerned.
Their argument is grounded in the notion

36
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,030
of Westphalian sovereignty.
The idea that a nation state is an ought

37
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,760
to be in charge of all affairs within 
its borders.

38
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,743
This modern notion of sovereignty only 
came to exist in 1648 after the major 

39
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,094
European powers were tired of fighting 
either the 30 years' war or eight years 

40
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:02,350
war,
which unlike the liar,

41
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:06,670
seven years' war actually lasted for as 
long as advertise the resulting peace of

42
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:09,850
Westphalia created the idea of 
sovereignty that we understand today,

43
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,400
but in our highly globalized modern 
world,

44
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,413
things are a little more complicated 
than when people were still charging 

45
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,560
into battle on horseback.

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,573
Many contemporary political commentators
are all about the idea of a post 

47
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:22,444
Westphalian world order.
They argued that globalization has 

48
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,960
broken down traditional ideas of who 
holds power were under this system.

49
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,823
Independent actors such as private 
corporations and terrorist cells are 

50
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,544
able to wield as much or sometimes more 
power than the nation states whose 

51
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:39,430
borders they cross at will.
In the film,

52
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:43,300
the avengers are portrayed as a product 
of this post Westphalian world.

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,540
There are a group of US based 
superhumans who go wherever they want,

54
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,493
whenever they want,
without the permission of local 

55
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,044
governments.
The film even emphasizes this modern 

56
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:55,270
notion of the avengers in its opening 
where our heroes tried to catch a former

57
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:56,104
hydra agent while using the language of 
a police operation complete with drones 

58
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,150
and calls for backup

59
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,143
Sam.
We need fire and rescue and the south 

60
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,100
side of the building.

61
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,933
However,
they function less like a traditional 

62
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,900
police force and more like a private 
security company.

63
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,943
If like main villain,
Zemo your family happens to be the one 

64
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,510
that gets blown up in their latest 
attempt at saving the world,

65
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,550
you might even consider them terrorists.

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,513
What would you call a group of us based 
enhanced individuals who routinely 

67
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:26,634
ignore sovereign borders and inflict 
their will wherever they choose and who 

68
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,070
frankly seemed unconcerned about what 
they leave behind.

69
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,023
The sokovia accords then are the 
Westphalian world dealing with post 

70
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,684
Westphalian realities.
The debate over the accords is grounded 

71
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,570
in two competing views of how the 
international arena works.

72
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,550
Realism and liberalism realism argue 
that states are self interested.

73
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,384
Power seeking rational actors who seek 
to maximize their security and chances 

74
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,340
of survival.
Liberalism,

75
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,470
stresses,
interdependence among states,

76
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,304
multinational corporations and 
international institutions arguing that 

77
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,144
these various actors can and should work
together for the benefit of all the 

78
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:11,670
Sokovia accords fit this liberalist 
paradigm to a tea under the new rule set

79
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,860
out in the accords.
Government actors I.

80
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,723
E.
The UN will work together with 

81
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,120
nongovernmental forces.
In this case,

82
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:20,580
the avengers for the presumed common 
good.

83
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,563
This means more rules and greater 
oversight for the avengers who will no 

84
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,164
longer be able to gallivant around the 
globe fighting whenever and wherever 

85
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,730
they please compromise

86
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,770
reassurance.
That's how the world works.

87
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,683
Tony Stark buys into the accords 
liberalist framework but still manages 

88
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,400
to do plenty of Gallo vantage.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,473
He seriously thinking,
listen to you after this fiasco and 

90
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,480
Leipzig,

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,313
you are used that cooperation with 
sovereign governments even to the point 

92
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:46,794
of accepting the imposed limitations is 
crucial for stark respect for the 

93
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:51,504
interdependent world order is part of 
what separates the avengers from the 

94
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:55,740
terrorist groups.
They fight.

95
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,430
We need to be put in check whatever form
that takes.

96
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,264
I'm game.
If we can't accept limitations were 

97
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:03,680
boundaryless.
We're no better than the bad guys.

98
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,290
Steve Rogers,
on the other hand,

99
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,124
is a realist.
He's focused on security and his own 

100
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,424
agenda first and foremost,
and argues against the Sokovia cords on 

101
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,204
the grounds that they will make the 
avengers less able to respond to 

102
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,550
critical situations,
thereby putting the world in danger.

103
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,870
If we call Tony,
hi,

104
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,713
you won't believe even if he did,
who knows if the accords or let them 

105
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,340
know we're on our own.
While the real,

106
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,174
his position allows for cooperation that
will increase the likelihood of the 

107
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:29,764
world survival.
Captain America is simply unconvinced 

108
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,810
that this cooperation will improve 
security for anyone.

109
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,853
Steve argues that the shifting agendas 
of those who uphold the accords could 

110
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:41,290
lead to compromise security down the 
line.

111
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,480
This is the United Nations we're talking
about.

112
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,600
It's not the World Security Council.
It's not shield.

113
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,434
It's not hydro,
but it's run by people with agendas and 

114
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:49,740
agendas

115
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,573
change.
The film asked some pretty heavy 

116
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:54,750
questions that may as well be directed 
at a modern superpower.

117
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,560
Is unfettered power inherently 
dangerous?

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,300
Do rules only tie up crucial fighting 
forces in dangerous amounts of red tape?

119
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,373
Instead of providing some black and 
white answer for an insanely complex 

120
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,300
question,
the film offers us some ambiguity.

121
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,223
While one may criticize captain America 
for his unilateral approach to solving 

122
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:12,720
things,

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,850
stop telling you anything else that 
you'll wrong.

124
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,510
You think you're right,
it makes you dangerous.

125
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,070
You could equally say the same of Tony 
Stark as he tries to enforce the Sokovia

126
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,904
accords leading to plenty of collateral 
damage along the way while exploring 

127
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,254
these international frameworks.
The film also explores how personal 

128
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:34,130
ethics can complicate these concepts.
When a terrorist blows up the UN killing

129
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,310
black panthers father,
he goes on the hunt for presumed culprit

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,144
bucky barnes.
The attack on the UN creates a riff 

131
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:40,754
between those vendors who want the 
government to take in bucky and those 

132
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:43,814
who believed.
Captain America's right to attempt his 

133
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,000
own rescue.
Where this conflict,

134
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:47,834
the film asks us to consider whether 
it's better to act based on a 

135
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:50,834
preconceived set of moral obligations 
like the captain's obligation to Bucky 

136
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,490
or with consideration for the greater 
good like stark and his compatriots,

137
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,450
Tony Stark in his gang and body branch 
of philosophy known as Utilitarianism,

138
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,463
which holds that actions should be 
judged based on their overall 

139
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,600
consequences rather than on their 
adherence to abstract ideals.

140
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,613
Tony Stark believes that oversight will 
reduce the amount of collateral damage 

141
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,064
caused by their activities and that this
is reason enough to support the Sokovia 

142
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:16,934
courts above and beyond his belief in 
the usefulness of a liberalist world 

143
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,414
order.
Tony Stark's supports the accords 

144
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:25,190
because they align with his own 
utilitarian conception of morality.

145
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,000
These two ideas are different though not
necessarily contradictory.

146
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,630
While he knows that the new rules will 
inconvenience him and his team,

147
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,900
he's convinced that they will improve 
the lot of humanity as a whole.

148
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,860
It's not about his personal convictions,
it's about the greater good.

149
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,913
Captain Rogers,
I know you believe what you're doing is 

150
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,220
right,
but for the collective good,

151
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,470
you must surrender.
Now,

152
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,100
Captain America,
on the other hand,

153
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,920
flirts with an ethical position known as
deontology.

154
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,903
Deontology judges the morality of an 
action itself without consideration for 

155
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,240
the affects that said action might have,
again,

156
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,130
not contradictory to his real as 
beliefs,

157
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:06,340
but different nonetheless from a 
deontological perspective,

158
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,233
certain actions can never be justified.
No matter how much they might promote 

159
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:13,390
some greater good like killing an 
innocent person,

160
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,253
even if it could save millions more.
While Steve Rogers isn't they perfect 

161
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:20,920
deontologist in the sense of Oh gee 
deontologist Emmanuelle con,

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,430
he acts according to personal laws 
rather than universal ones.

163
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,550
He bases his actions around a set of 
moral duties.

164
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,563
CAPP believes that his moral duty to 
save his friend Bucky Barnes trumps 

165
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:34,810
whatever greater good might be served by
his death or imprisonment.

166
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,793
No matter how many cops bucky happens to
beat the piss out of it in the films 

167
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,170
closing minutes,
we learned that all the carnage,

168
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,004
betrayal and heartbreak we've followed 
for the last two hours is the secret 

169
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,410
plan of former Sokovia in special 
operatives,

170
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:51,280
Zemo whose loved ones were more 
collateral damage of the avengers,

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,060
Zemo or feels that it was his plan all 
along to tear the vendor's apart.

172
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,710
Showing Tony Stark footage of bucky 
barnes murdering his parents.

173
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,680
[inaudible] bites enemies can rise 
again.

174
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,870
The line was crumbles from within.

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,833
That's that

176
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,353
forever and here I think the film 
suggests a failing all these 

177
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:14,524
philosophical systems,
no matter how right participants in 

178
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:18,094
these systems believe they are,
there will always be somebody who gets 

179
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:21,784
the shaft.
Tony Stark is confronted by the mother 

180
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:27,390
of one of the many eggs he had to crack 
in order to make a superhero omelet.

181
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Who's going to avenge my son's stark?
He's dead and I blame you.

182
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,040
She is essentially in the same camp as 
Zemo.

183
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,990
Whether you're operating for the greater
good,

184
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,853
your personal ethics at the behest of 
your own country or an international 

185
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:46,470
agreement.
There's always a Zemo that loses out.

186
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,070
And that's the problem with the force.
As powerful as the avengers,

187
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,150
as division says,
I'll very strength invites challenged.

188
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:55,650
Challenge,
insights,

189
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,340
conflict.

190
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,170
Yeah.

191
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,003
Conflict

192
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,283
breeds catastrophe.
Someone is always going to get shafted 

193
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:07,830
by these philosophical systems,
but when the team doing the shafting has

194
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:10,320
the collective force of a nuclear 
superpower,

195
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,423
the forces that challenged them,
we'll invite equally destructive force 

196
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,610
and that can turn out pretty poorly for 
the world.

197
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,850
So what do you think are the avengers 
right to agree to the accords?

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,773
Should captain America give up his own 
code for the greater good or are there 

199
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,494
just no right answers?
Let us know what you think in the 

200
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,250

And thanks for watching peace.
