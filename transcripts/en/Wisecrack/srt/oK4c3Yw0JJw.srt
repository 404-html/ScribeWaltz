00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
This video is sponsored by movement 
watches in sunglasses,

2
00:00:02,721 --> 00:00:04,490
more on movement.
At the end of this video,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,170
hey,

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,003
for one disembodied jared here,
back to talk to you about the Merc with 

5
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:12,221
a mouth.
Now,

6
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,054
deadpool probably means a lot to you.
It's sharp wit is a welcome reprieve 

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,003
from a torrent of superhero movies.
Nobody's getting hurt and we're sure 

8
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,054
dead pool two will be no different,
but I'm here to talk about something 

9
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:28,570
else.
Not only,

10
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:32,140
as we've mentioned previously,
is dead pull a kind of microcosm for the

11
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,330
ironic distance that pervades our 
culture,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,253
but it represents a lot more.
Does deadpool hold the secret to how 

13
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:41,460
people can get you to buy more stuff?
Welcome to this Blob,

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,191
blah,
blah,

15
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:44,440
blah,
and no spoilers ahead this time.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,513
Can we say that?
Let's begin our story with the most 

17
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:50,680
recent adverts for deadpool two,
the teaser at the beginning of Logan and

18
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:53,500
the wet on wet trailer.
Both of these succeed free,

19
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,760
very simple reason.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,863
They actively refuse to do what normal 
promotional material should do in the 

21
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:00,304
Logan teaser.
Deadpool takes too long changing in a 

22
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:05,110
phone booth while a hapless civilian 
gets brutally assaulted.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,610
In the end,
he's too late,

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,573
but being honest with myself,
I probably should have just called nine 

25
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,694
one one.
The whole thing pokes fun at one of our 

26
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,310
cultures.
Oldest icons,

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,233
superman and for good measure,
a random essay about the old man in the 

28
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:18,070
seat.
We're still scratching our heads at that

29
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:18,904
one.
Maybe it has something to do with Logan 

30
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,850
and Santiago,
sacrificial nature.

31
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,410
I Dunno.
In the trailer,

32
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,244
wet on wet deadpool.
Don's a sweet fro in a soothing 

33
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,650
Baritone,
imitating Bob Ross's the joy of painting

34
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,100
even before Deadpool,
our cultural obsession with Bob Ross has

35
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,160
always included a little dose of irony 
and if you tell them,

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,500
and it wasn't that,
that bushes there,

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,680
I will come to your house and I will cut
you.

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,700
The wholesome public television show 
full of dad humor and happy little trees

39
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:48,670
became an internet sensation.
It's naive.

40
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:51,200
Authenticity became a joke for 
disillusion.

41
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,960
Millennials,

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,793
I'm not a very good fisherman.
I catch a little fish and take the hook 

43
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,950
carefully out of his mouth.
Put a bandaid on him going the CTR patty

44
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,450
one to two two and putting back in the 
water

45
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,070
in wet on wet.
The colors are movie jokes.

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,240
Bob Ross's very real obsession with 
whacking his brushes is highlighted.

47
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,320
What's that often shake off the excess 
and just beat the devil out of.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,580
That's really the most fun part of it

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,460
and the chief engineer is one jury La 
Forge.

50
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,410
Both of these are awesome,
right?

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,840
When I saw them in theaters,
people were losing their shit,

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,330
but is there something more to it than 
just,

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,253
it's funny if anything,
these promotions are anti promotions by 

54
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,394
flaunting their absurdity.
They mostly avoid teasing the actual 

55
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:38,400
movie they're promoting held.
The first deadpool movie marketed itself

56
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,560
as a Romcom at one point.
Surprise.

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,320
This is actually lucky.
You are love story.

58
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,710
Instead of promises of cool fight scenes
in a suspenseful plot.

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,633
The whole pre logan trailer just raises 
doubts about Super Harrowing in general 

60
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,040
is a phone booth doing on a street 
corner and wet on wet has a real trailer

61
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,874
packed on the end of a series of not so 
subtle in you with no relation to the 

62
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,174
movie itself.
It just get high and all laughs 

63
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,870
splendor.
God,

64
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,704
I love cocaine and here's the point.
The secret of self promotion in 2017 is 

65
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,610
to make fun of the very fact that you're
being self promotional.

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,513
That's supposed to sell deodorant.
Talk about something real like the 

67
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:19,550
smooth,
sophisticated center mall spice.

68
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,453
The secret is cynicism,
but to understand why this is uniquely 

69
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,054
successful today,
we have to turn back to a guy who lived 

70
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:29,480
in a barrel and made philosophy out of 
pissing in public dialogue.

71
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,333
He needs,
the cynic was one of the progenitors of 

72
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:32,424
Western cynical philosophy.
It's disputed whether or not he's the 

73
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:38,340
reason we use the term cynicism to 
describe his school philosophy,

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,070
but the term cynic,
which in Greek means dog,

75
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:43,680
like what's at the very least an insult 
hurled.

76
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,420
At diageo,
he's by his contemporaries,

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,433
but either way,
he really embraced the term and made a 

78
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:48,864
habit of urinating and fornicating in 
public just like our four legged 

79
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,330
friends,
never one to half ass anything.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,900
Even tried eating raw meat,
not unlike our foul mouth.

81
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:58,734
Tiro Dodge and he spent his time 
berating the customs and habits of his 

82
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:02,514
peers,
whereas dead pool may successfully type 

83
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,370
cast his peers,
oh,

84
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,204
come on,
it'll leave me all alone here with less 

85
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,050
angry rosie o'donnell.

86
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,760
They are genies would do things like 
stop on Plato's carpet yelling.

87
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,683
I trample on the pride of plato running 
into Plato's classroom with a plump 

88
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:19,644
chicken screaming,
behold Plato's man and ordering his 

89
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:22,974
remains three thrown over the city wall 
so that wild animals could feast on his 

90
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,144
corpse.
The point for [inaudible] was to be 

91
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:29,664
relentlessly cynical toward the habit 
and customs of the well to do with 

92
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,000
Finian's if they viewed themselves as 
noble purveyors.

93
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,280
Of Truth.
Dow Ginny's would carry around a lantern

94
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,230
in broad daylight telling those around 
him.

95
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,064
He was searching for an honest man if 
they thought defecating in public was 

96
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:45,174
beneath the dignity of a civilized man,
die jays would drop trau right in the 

97
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,584
middle of the [inaudible].
It's not an entirely different than 

98
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,400
these superhero that refuses to be a 
hero.

99
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,340
Ooh,
and Cherry Garcia ice cream.

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,150
I can eat this,
but

101
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,983
despite their similarities,
deadpool and diage needs are 

102
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:02,894
fundamentally different.
At least according to the logic of 

103
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,430
philosopher Peter slaughter died for 
slaughter dyke.

104
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,180
If diageo has represented a pointed 
criticism of his contemporaries,

105
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,103
cynicism today has become universal and 
diffuse permeating every aspect of our 

106
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,750
culture.
News,

107
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,450
film,
Video Games are all made cynically,

108
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,480
and we even perform our jobs with a 
cynical indifference.

109
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,370
The logic boils down to,
hey,

110
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,040
at least it's a paycheck on a global 
scale.

111
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,053
Slaughter Dyke was writing in the 1980s 
but he might as well have been riding 

112
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:32,984
today if diageo needs publicly performed
in such a way to rid the world of bad 

113
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,544
ideas.
Modern cynicism is merely a resignation 

114
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,024
to the fact that everything is terrible 
and while deadpool is perfect proof of 

115
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,090
universal cynicism,
that doesn't actually change anything.

116
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,103
Also consider the steady stream of self 
aware advertising that succeeds by 

117
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,660
virtue that it rejects it's berry 
premise.

118
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,733
Men.
Lebron James made a sprite commercial 

119
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,850
for the super bowl where he ironically 
and repeatedly affirms the,

120
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,670
he'll never tell you to drink sprite.
Let's get one thing straight.

121
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
I'll never tell you to drink sprite.
Even if I wasn't a commercial for 

122
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,680
sprite,
which I am.

123
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,040
New Castle made a superbowl ad about how
they couldn't afford a superbowl ad.

124
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,063
Turns out they don't even have the money
or permission to make us more so they 

125
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:21,720
can't even say the word.
Basically,

126
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:22,554
the only thing I haven't done is a nude 
scene and get paid money to be at a 

127
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:27,780
commercial for a beer.
I don't even drink

128
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,683
cards against humanity.
Made a whole black Friday campaign out 

129
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:34,690
of mailing people poop and if mailing 
people poop is a metaphor for successful

130
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:35,524
marketing in our modern age.
Deadpool's advertising is the Creme de 

131
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,580
la at her to film promotion.

132
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,990
Hold each of your man berries or as I 
like to call them,

133
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,824
smooth criminals,

134
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,400
trailers that aren't trailers.
A superhero who is not a hero.

135
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,383
Per Brazil's comicon.
Deadpool released a video where he 

136
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,874
offers a supposedly heartfelt attempt to
connect with his Brazilian fans by 

137
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,570
saying the show my dedication to the 
yeah

138
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,463
legions of Brazilian deadpool fans.
I've spent up to 20 minutes on Google 

139
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:00,414
translate as well as countless hours 
watching Tele novellas to teach me 

140
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,970
everything about your official language

141
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,630
before offering up eight clearly not 
deadpool,

142
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,470
voiceover

143
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,400
you're goes [inaudible],
[inaudible],

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,750
[inaudible],

145
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,400
but perhaps nothing exemplifies this 
trend.

146
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,263
Like a recent rick and morty old spice 
at Rick Sanchez introduces some 

147
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,224
anthropomorphize old spice products in a
board monotone before counting neath 

148
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,333
thousands of dollars he just made for 
the shameless promotion for slaughter 

149
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,874
died.
This is what separates modern cynicism 

150
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,274
from the cynicism of Diageo.
Our modern economy is compatible with 

151
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,024
nothing,
quite so much as the limitations about 

152
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,960
the corrupting effect of all mighty 
money.

153
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,990
Money makes the world go round.
Isn't that terrible?

154
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,330
What makes this work for advertising to 
you?

155
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:50,800
Slaughter dykes words is that cynicism 
is criticism with limited liability.

156
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,650
Deadpool can joke about the budget 
constraints of his own movie,

157
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,553
Big House.
It's funny that I only ever see two of 

158
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,444
you.
It's almost like the studio couldn't 

159
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,760
afford another Eczema

160
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,890
or even its own lead.

161
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,780
I think Ryan Reynolds got this far on 
his superior acting method

162
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,753
and in doing so protects itself from any
judgements about budget constraints or 

163
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,690
acting resumes for slaughter died.
This is fundamentally different than the

164
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,524
cynicism of diabetes they are needs met 
the customs and ideas of his peers with 

165
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:18,850
pure satirical laughter.
It worked because he also constructed an

166
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:22,060
alternative living like a stray dog out 
of a giant barrel.

167
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,060
In response to the contemporary 
definitions of citizenship,

168
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,490
he declared he was a citizen of the 
world.

169
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,623
Rather,
our modern cynicism lacks any 

170
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:31,114
alternative,
whereas some thinkers posited that the 

171
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:35,740
masses will follow their leaders with a 
false consciousness.

172
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,260
A metaphorical wool pulled over their 
eyes.

173
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,213
Slaughter Dyke posits that modern 
cynicism is enlightened false 

174
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:43,174
consciousness.
We are acutely aware that there is wool 

175
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,970
over our eyes,
but we safe get wall is warm and cozy.

176
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,480
Creators may know an advertisement is 
stupid,

177
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,333
but on a commercial is so annoying,
but you got a great product or a 

178
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,660
superhero trope is overused.
Superhero landing,

179
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,310
so you're going to do a superhero 
landing,

180
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,990
but hey,
gotta pay the bills,

181
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:01,824
right?

182
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,260
Whoa.

183
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,243
Superhero landing.
The alternative is to make a movie that 

184
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:10,040
no one watches or a youtube video.
I'm still hurt about that one.

185
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,140
Yay.

186
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,620
Consider the painting at the end of wet 
on wet.

187
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,603
It's an alteration of Norman Rockwell's 
freedom from want depicting a wholesome 

188
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,030
family ready to eat a giant Merica size 
Turkey,

189
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,030
part of his four freedom series based on
the FDR speech.

190
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,730
The message was,
here's what makes America great.

191
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,130
The freedom to pray,
to eat a ton of meat,

192
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:36,060
to feel safe and to speak your mind.
In typical deadpool fashion,

193
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,880
a wholesome image is robbed of its 
original meaning.

194
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,460
This is another microcosm of our cynical
era.

195
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,443
Straightforward defenses of any kind of 
values are scorned as naive at best and 

196
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,424
at worst are vulnerable to being wrong.
Considered the worst advertisement of 

197
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:53,670
the century.
Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad we're a can of

198
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,504
diabetes.
Water brings together protesters and 

199
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:56,904
riot cops.
On the one hand we all cringed because 

200
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,950
the ad cynically watered down social 
movements to sell soda,

201
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,530
but the real mistake was to defend 
anything at all,

202
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,510
even if behind the scenes it was 
cynical.

203
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,310
If the add added a few do not attempt in
real life or results not guaranteed.

204
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,293
We want of all laugh that such a self 
aware add cynical advertising upfront 

205
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,750
about its own cynicism is smart 
advertising.

206
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,340
It's advertising with limited liability,
so it shouldn't surprise us that figures

207
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,174
like superman,
a symbol of heroism and goodness or 

208
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,180
Norman Rockwell's freedom from want draw
the ire of dead pool slaughtered.

209
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,014
I quotes Georg symbol who said,
the more money becomes the sole center 

210
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,780
of interest,
the more we see honor and convictions,

211
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:37,614
talent and virtue,
beauty and health of the soul mobilized 

212
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,884
on monies behalf.
The more a mocking and frivolous mood 

213
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:43,824
will arise regarding these values which 
are offered for sale for the same kind 

214
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,874
of value as goods on the weekly market.
Deadpool is the embodiment of this 

215
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:55,320
frivolous and mocking mood because 
heroics and values are for sale.

216
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,300
How are we not supposed to laugh at 
them?

217
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,120
Please don't make it super suit green or
animated.

218
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,610
And because there exists no conceivable 
way to escape the system,

219
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,400
we criticize like perhaps diageo needs.
The cynic could.

220
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,720
What else are we to do?

221
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,613
Wow.

222
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,703
So what do you think is cynicism and 
marketing the best way to advertise 

223
