1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,043
Hey guys,
so this is the launch of the first 

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,150
wisecrack pilot for 2018.
We've got a couple of them in the works.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,193
We will work really hard on him,
but most importantly we want to know 

4
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,254
what you guys think,
so let us know what you think in the 

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,070
comments and enjoy the show.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,640
Sometimes it's the details of a film 
that matter most likely a single shot,

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,323
a needle drop.
I see a little line of dialogue is 

8
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:32,894
looking at your kid a sudden cut what 
seemed like insignificant choices often 

9
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,260
say more in under 20 seconds than other 
films say into ours.

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,423
In this new format,
we'll be studying these seemingly 

11
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:45,914
trivial pieces revealing how even the 
smallest elements can bring layers of 

12
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:53,330
meaning to a piece of art.
Welcome to wise cracks the film,

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,280
the wolf of Wall Street

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,560
and sell me this pen,

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,870
the closing shot of the wolf of Wall 
Street.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,310
This pen works and I just used simple 
push in and crane up.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,500
Well,
what if I told you this shot changes the

18
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:19,501
meaning of the entire film?
This pen works and I personally,

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,583
as a client describes the pin,
is voice drowns out and solemn music 

20
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,960
kicks in.
Up to this point,

21
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,370
the film is utilized,
poppy,

22
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:32,770
upbeat,
hits to underscore the debauchery,

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,240
the amnesia phase,

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,060
so why the sudden shift to something 
more serious and meditative.

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,400
For most of its three hour run time,
the wolf of Wall Street revels in Jordan

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Belfort's access his yacht,
his women,

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,840
his drugs,
his parties,

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,380
the lifestyle paid for by defrauding 
investors.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,273
That is until the FBI circles in seizing
Belfort's cash and sending them away to 

30
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:04,584
prison for four years,
but unlike similar films where the 

31
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,950
corrupt Wall Street broker gets locked 
up and justice is served,

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,023
the wolf of Wall Street is absent any 
overt moralizing Belford prison time is 

33
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,990
a cakewalk and he doesn't even serve his
full sentence.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,850
In the end,
nothing has changed.

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,910
Belfort to still selling and the people 
well,

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,810
they're still buying,
but this is just the tip of the iceberg.

37
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,750
The final shot can be interpreted in a 
number of ways,

38
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,710
but here are our three favorites.
One,

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,350
the final shot holds up a mirror to us 
movie goers.

40
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:38,184
Viewing the film,
notice there's eight backlight behind 

41
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,980
the seminar that evokes a projector 
shining on the back of an audience.

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,560
So what does this mean?
Well,

43
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,970
it may be easy to lay the blame solely 
on Jordan for all the moral depravity,

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,003
wolf of Wall Street,

45
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,180
but perhaps the final shot,
the blame not only on Belford,

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,580
but on us and the culture that allows 
and encourages his behavior.

47
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,790
He divorced me,
but yeah,

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,330
let's do it.
Early on,

49
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,610
Belford says,
we person you're on the phone with,

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,010
they want to get rich and they want to 
get rich quickly.

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,043
They don't want something familiar.
We may feel dignified because we're not 

52
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,903
crawling on the ground on quileutes,
but truth is Jordan scam wouldn't work 

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,440
if we didn't share his dream of getting 
rich quickly,

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,630
wanting something or nothing.
Y'all want to be just like him.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,793
Scorsese is essentially calling us out.
We've just spent three hours partying 

56
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:40,250
with laughing and reveling in his 
experts.

57
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,743
It's no wonder Jordan doesn't suffer any
punishments in the end because after 

58
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,170
all,
we revel in everything he does.

59
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,350
Living vicariously through him,
wishing that we could live his life too.

60
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,323
To all these people staring intently at 
one person hanging on his every word 

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,820
remind you of something.
We're going to go there.

62
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,250
Scorsese,
a devout Catholic,

63
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,340
has spent much of his career exploring 
faith in his films,

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,593
yet in the wolf of Wall Street 
characters worship at the altar of 

65
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,240
something else.
Money

66
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,960
the camera holds on these people,
each one and focus so we can see they're

67
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:28,650
painfully average faces.
Desperate plain looking.

68
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:29,484
People looking for meaning,
desiring that which can elevate them 

69
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,010
above their mundane existence.
Iscore,

70
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:36,540
Scorsese,
cynically likening,

71
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:41,070
be transformative power of faith to the 
transformative power of money,

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,480
except the Almighty never promised a 
million bucks in eight easy steps.

73
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,613
Three,
one if by solidly portraying a crowd 

74
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:52,200
that warships Jordan,
despite his detestable actions,

75
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,303
scorsese suggests something really 
sinister that we actually like being 

76
00:04:57,271 --> 00:05:01,000
taken advantage of.
French philosophers,

77
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,834
John Francois Leotard famously said as 
much the English unemployed did not 

78
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:10,431
become workers to survive.
They enjoyed the hysterical masochistic,

79
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:13,380
whatever exhaustion it was hanging on in
the minds,

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,290
in the foundries,
in the factories in hell.

81
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,393
They enjoyed it,
enjoyed the mad destruction of their 

82
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:22,524
organic bodies,
the decomposition of their personal 

83
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:28,070
identity.
You are lower than pond scum,

84
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,810
enjoyed the disillusion of their 
families and villages,

85
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,883
and enjoyed the new monsters,
anonymity of the suburbs in the pubs in 

86
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:39,000
the morning and evening.
So could this closing image indicate the

87
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:39,834
voluntary submission of the masses who 
not only don't mind white collar 

88
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:44,504
criminals stealing their money,
but find a perverse enjoyment in their 

89
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:51,260
banal existence under the heel of the 
Jordan Belfort's of the world.

90
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,270
This one single shot is emblematic of 
just how complex the wolf of Wall Street

91
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:59,270
is as a true totem of our culture of 
access.

92
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,620
The film defies easy answers.
This format is a bit of a test for us,

93
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,050
so let us know what you think in the 
comments and as always,

94
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,360
guys,
thanks for watching peace.

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,440
So hope you guys enjoyed that.
We've got a whole bunch of pilots on the

96
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,300
slate this year.
This is just one of them.

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,220
We've got another one coming out in 
about a month.

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,860
Also next month.
We're doing the next in this series,

99
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,694
which is on the shining,
so be sure to be on the lookout for 

100
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,750
that.
This one was really special to us.

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,280
Uh,
as you know from watching our channel,

102
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,114
we love movies.
This was an opportunity for us to take 

103
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,574
our love for movies to the next step.
So we wanted to leave you guys a little 

104
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,470
behind the scenes on how it was that we 
put this thing together and the big crew

105
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,290
that it took to make this thing 
possible.

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,310
So enjoy the behind the scenes and we'll
see what the next one and about a month.

107
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,630
Thanks guys.
Hey,

108
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,640
what's up guys?
We're on the set of project.

109
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,250
I'm wearing something I would never 
wear,

110
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,810
but it's for the shoot is behind the 
scenes,

111
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,130
so hope you guys enjoy.

112
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,890
We're doing this very interesting thing 
today.

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,160
We're working on the shining through.
Jared and I were brainstorming on how we

114
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,490
can come up with something that had a 
little more production value,

115
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,440
right?
To take the idea of a video essay,

116
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,583
but we're talking about a theme 
typically or philosophy in movies and 

117
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,960
now instead it's like how can we talk 
more about technique and style and do it

118
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:18,794
in a way that's different from most 
other video assets you find on the 

119
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:21,824
Internet Lot,
rode microphones and digital spot 

120
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,063
supporting us.
Your donation and your health and your 

121
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:30,914
support means everything to us.
You guys will be possible for us to try 

122
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:42,110
and continue to develop wise crack,
to continue to stretch the brand.

123
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,944
Try and make it into something more and 
more special and for all of you that 

124
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:49,190
support us on this journey and to try 
and make it the best it can be.

125
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:52,160
Thank you so much and hopefully you guys
enjoy our new efforts.
