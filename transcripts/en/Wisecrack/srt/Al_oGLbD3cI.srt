Hey,
wise crack.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,640
Jared here.
For those of you following ourself,

park podcast,
respect or authortalk.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,310
You know,
we've been reflecting on how this season

8
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:17,144
is focused more on people's reaction to 
our modern cultural cluster rather than 

9
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,820
the actual events themselves.
Well,

10
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,654
this week the show commented on people's
reaction to something very close to our 

11
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,030
hearts.
South Park itself.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,163
It makes me feel old saying this,
but many of you may not remember a 

13
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:34,550
little movie called South Park,
bigger,

14
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,384
longer,
and uncut because it's almost 20 years 

15
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,710
old.
This episode artfully echoes the movie,

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,930
but this time things are a little 
different.

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,900
Is southpark showing signs of a moral 
crisis?

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,973
Well,
let's find out for those of you who 

19
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,550
aren't caught up on this season,
kyle falls for carbons,

20
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,384
girlfriend,
Heidi.

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,970
But after a brief flirtation,
Heidi cakes,

22
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,520
kyle to the curb,
returns to Cartman sweaty,

23
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,720
stubby,
armed embrace,

24
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,350
it starts to match her bloated bow right
down to his trademark.

25
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,960
Assholery Jag,
a special needs science fair.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,193
No thanks.
Let's start the discussion with Heidi 

27
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:06,554
and Hartman brawling in the hallway 
while goes to break up the fight and of 

28
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,690
course everyone hates that he ruined the
fun.

29
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,471
Shut up,
Kai.

30
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,430
You sound like your mom.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,530
From that point on,
kyle is the butt of a thousand jokes and

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,000
tell.
He thinks he's figured out what's caused

33
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:23,450
such a culture of meanness at school.
His former favorite show,

34
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,463
terrence and fill up those two Canadians
have kept on farting into old age and 

35
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,140
have even tooted their way into a brand 
new netflix original series.

36
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,213
The new show is a hit,
but kyle hates it because having been a 

37
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,054
metaphorically farted on in school,
he finds himself sympathizing with the 

38
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:43,700
people getting farted on in the show for
the first time.

39
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:44,534
I feel kind of bad for the person being 
farted on rather than letting those 

40
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:50,720
loose bowel loonies continue poisoning 
the hearts and minds of children.

41
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,643
Heile takes a stand.
You're organizes an activist group 

42
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,614
called millennials against Canada.
His protest leads him to shutting down 

43
00:01:57,741 --> 00:02:00,410
the show and eventually it goes all the 
way to the president.

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,423
Garrison tells kyle to stop the protest,
but he won't and kyle eventually gets 

45
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:05,804
garrison literally turned on drew's.
I've got a little chubb by the idea of 

46
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,570
Nuking Canada.
Now with that plot.

47
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:13,190
Sounds familiar.
Congratulations.

48
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:16,100
You like us,
have watched a lot of south park.

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,300
Turns out those jokes about kyle being 
like his mom were just empty insults.

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,960
Kyle's protest mirrors the behavior of 
his mother in south park bigger,

51
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:24,794
long for an uncut,
just as Sheila created mothers against 

52
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,110
Candida to protest the obscenity of the 
terrance and Philip movie.

53
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,123
Hile has created millennials against 
Canada to protest terrence and Phillips 

54
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:34,754
and new Netflix show.
The parallels are more than just 

55
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,800
conceptual.
They lift entire scenes from the movie.

56
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,723
We can't believe that a movie was some 
foul language would piss you off summer 

57
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,590
please.
Can I finish?

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,540
Okay,
I bet that's how you know.

59
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,443
How can I bet?
Because you were all waste on it 

60
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,970
yourself.
Please.

61
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,800
Can I finish?
All right.

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,610
I finished

63
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,610
on one level.
This is south way of playfully comparing

64
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,444
millennial hostility toward offensive 
media to the parents of the 90s who 

65
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:08,410
blamed issues like drug use and 
columbine on everything from heavy metal

66
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,244
to south park.
But there's something else going on 

67
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,484
here.
The South Park movie features a movie 

68
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,660
within a movie,
terrorists and Philip asses a fire.

69
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,750
It was a metal stand in for the South 
Park movie itself.

70
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,703
Just as Kyle and company,
we're witnessing a cruder r rated 

71
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,931
version of an already obscene TV show.
We the audience were similarly consuming

72
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
a cruder r rated version of an already 
obscene TV show while parents were 

73
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:37,774
protesting southpark in real life.
Parents in the movie protested terrence 

74
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:41,764
and Philip.
The Canadian duo has always been a riff 

75
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:44,554
on how people who've never watched south
park characterize the show is nothing 

76
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,214
but Barton poop jokes.
The thinking is South Park is far from 

77
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,814
terrance and fill up these days.
South Park has gotten increasingly 

78
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:58,330
topical and specific over the years with
the occasional returned to their roots.

79
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,490
Alexa,
add big hairy baths.

80
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,200
Do My shopping list.
Okay.

81
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,570
I've added big hairy balls to your 
shopping list.

82
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,890
That means that old tariffs and Philip,
despite sharing initials with South Park

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,793
Creator Trey Parker,
aren't a perfect parallel to the show 

84
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,850
itself,
but the idea that both shows are objects

85
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,330
of both love and scorn in their 
respective universes holds up.

86
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,580
So with carrots and Philip acids have 
higher.

87
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,414
Matt and Trey were asking us to go along
with them as they wonder about their 

88
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,210
place in the cultural landscape where 
they to blame back then,

89
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,570
their answer was a resounding no.
Now,

90
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,450
in the turbulent times of 2017 they're 
doing it again,

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,673
but this time the answer up to whether 
or not they're implicated in society's 

92
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,364
ills is not so clear.
Once Kyle realizes that the person 

93
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:46,960
getting farted on has feelings too,
he finds the show cruel and offensive.

94
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,883
On one hand,
Kyle's growing distance from terrance 

95
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,034
and Philip is a commentary on how 
millennials new found awareness has 

96
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,750
rendered old school south park humor no 
longer relevant,

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,680
which leaves Matt and Trey Feeling as 
old as terrorists and Philip look,

98
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,723
on the other hand,
this is the beginning of the show's 

99
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,584
attempt at self evaluation.
Heile takes his concern to the new vice 

100
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:06,670
principal,
strong woman.

101
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,493
There's a culture at the school and they
didn't break his meanness and I believe 

102
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:14,230
now it comes from a Canadian TV show.
All the boys watch it.

103
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,363
I did too.
We all laugh while they fart innocent 

104
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,500
people's heads.
The thing is,

105
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,130
I never felt for the person being farted
on until now.

106
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,560
There's no shortage of things,
pieces that suggests that south park may

107
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:32,030
have fostered this culture of meanness,
but strong woman disagrees.

108
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,530
You want to blame farts?
That seems kind of ridiculous,

109
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,590
doesn't it?
I mean,

110
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,453
it's a slippery slope when we start 
pointing the finger for our own 

111
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:43,034
shortcomings.

112
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,943
She's making a very salient point here,
one that we can dig deeper into by 

113
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,090
again,
returning to bigger,

114
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,700
longer and uncut as the war with Canada 
rages.

115
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,700
Kyle runs into his mother.
She says it was all for him,

116
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,980
but kyle doesn't see it that way.
I,

117
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm doing very important

118
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,843
things,
but you never took the time to talk to 

119
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,540
me.
Whenever I get in trouble,

120
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,820
you'll go up and blame everybody else.
But I'm the one to blame here with me.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,833
Sheila has started an entire wars that 
she could avoid confronting the fact 

122
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,374
that she was simply a bad parent who 
didn't pay attention to what her child 

123
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,730
needed,
just like his mom.

124
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:19,060
Kyle brings about horrible things,
not because of his principles,

125
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:21,430
but because of his self absorbed 
motivations.

126
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,370
What do you like what I want to world?
We've mapped,

127
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,204
it doesn't come at someone else's 
expense where people can live freely 

128
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,460
without fear.
Think farted on.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,433
I want a world we want ridiculed for 
Teigen out a world where nice girl that 

130
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,290
I liked is it turned into another Eric,

131
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,890
you're kyle admits the real reason for 
his actions,

132
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,843
the shortcomings he was trying to hide.
So if Sheila was protesting the terrans 

133
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,090
and Philip movie to cover her own 
failings as a parent,

134
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,163
and Kyle is doing it to hide his 
feelings of having lost Heidi to 

135
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,330
Cartman,
what does that say about South Park?

136
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,750
The show since kyle is so often the 
voice of the show,

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,880
I've been thinking,
how did shamelessness get to this?

138
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,283
Did it start with that people on 
scooters or did the bar get lowered way 

139
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,820
before that?
And then I started thinking maybe it was

140
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,550
us,
I don't know,

141
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,473
but maybe somehow we lower the bar a 
long time ago and now we're all sitting 

142
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,890
here in this.
Think of it all.

143
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,973
Well maybe it's this,
maybe kyle sadness at losing Heidi who 

144
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:27,474
has basically turned into a female 
version of cartman antisemitism in all 

145
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,360
mirrors,
Matt and trey sadness at creating a show

146
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,194
that may have spawned a few real life 
Cartman's they've always prided 

147
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,840
themselves on making fun of everyone 
equally,

148
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,823
but now do they just come off like out 
of touch old people farting on 

149
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:44,574
minorities?

150
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,013
Yeah.

151
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,770
Now just to be clear,
I love South Park and hate censorship.

152
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,760
Put this critical look in the mirror 
also reflects the show's identity crisis

153
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,180
after a failed attempt at full on 
satirical serialization.

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,320
We're now in the midst of a season full 
of ups and downs and a mix of tones.

155
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,273
The episodes range from terrance and 
Philip's style fart jokes to failed 

156
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:09,904
political satires two successful ones 
and episodes that don't make a lot of 

157
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,850
sense.
Should they be a political show?

158
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,803
Don't even want to,
can he still be funny if people are now 

159
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:21,670
concerned that people are farting on 
half feelings,

160
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,230
are we truly in a post funny era of 
satire knowing that Matt and Trey find a

161
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,350
lot of 2017 to be miserable just like 
the rest of us.

162
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,333
It's interesting that unlike bigger,
longer and uncut they aren't giving 

163
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:36,220
themselves a free pass.
Now we don't know how that evaluation is

164
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,054
going to play out,
but the episode ends on a real 

165
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,190
cliffhanger.

166
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,650
What comes after the bombs land on 
Canada?

167
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,040
Well we'll just have to twiddle our 
fingers until the season finale.

168
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,810
So what do you think wise crack.
Do you think the show is getting Maudlin

169
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:53,050
in its old age looking back on its past 
like a bleary-eyed former football state

170
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,800
champion or do Matt and Trey just not 
give it?

171
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,660
Maybe we're overthinking it either way.
Let us know what you think and as always

172
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,970
peace.
