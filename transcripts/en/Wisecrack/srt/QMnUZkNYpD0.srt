1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,660
This week on thought those,
we bring it all the boys to the yard,

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,320
but the glass Menagerie by Tennessee 
Williams,

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,493
my main narrator,
tom gives us the low down that 

4
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:27,090
everything we about to people on this 
stage is a memory of his dad.

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,550
His Dad,
he skipped town a long time ago,

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,503
leaving his Mama,
Amanda and her sister Laura cashed out 

7
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:33,984
on the struggle,
so now tom got to be the breadwinner is 

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,150
grubbing time and wingfield crib where 
Amanda like Laura,

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,453
keep that as tight to make sure the boys
were highland mama bugging that lower 

10
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:45,864
going to be single forever,
but Lord don't expect any browsers to 

11
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,134
show up one to woo her and since she got
a busted ass foot and always acting all 

12
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,504
shy and Amanda started running her mouth
about how she was so fine back in the 

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,753
day that she had 17 busters and one 
afternoon trying to get a crack at that 

14
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,290
ghetto booty.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,140
Amanda say she could've bagged a rich 
playboy,

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,500
but she chose that scrub ass daddy.
Instead.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,340
Later Lord making show her glass 
collection shines.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,810
When Mama gets all tears saying why you 
ain't been going to that school,

19
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,644
I paid for it.
Apparently Laura been ducking out and 

20
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:27,030
walking around birdhouses and Amanda 
about had it with you like girl.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,923
Has there ever been a brother you wanted
a piece of that was this fly player 

22
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:35,820
named Jim back in high school who used 
to call me blue roses,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,550
but jim was to happen and to kick it 
with Laura.

24
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:42,240
A couple months later,
a man again Tom's grill.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,400
When he snapped and say,
woman,

26
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,920
stop riding my nuts trying to control 
me.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,060
I'm the one bringing home the bread tom 
piece out to the movies,

28
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,730
but mama say he probably doing something
scandalous,

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,773
grabbed the car which and bails.
Next morning Tom Apologizes for being a 

30
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,564
dick and said he go to the movies 
because he jonesing for a life of 

31
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,494
adventure.

32
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,550
Mama say,
boy,

33
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,590
you better get your head out of your 
ass.

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,573
We got to make plans for Laura Hooker.
Robber one of them warehouse boys you 

35
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,930
work with.
So later,

36
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,764
Tom,
tell his momma he got to do name 

37
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,823
O'connor dropping by.
Amanda loses trying to prep and Tom say 

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,420
chill.
He doesn't even know about lower.

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,303
I mean real talk.
She crippled and spent all day with her 

40
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:27,870
glass animals.
Next night,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,913
tom started talking about that boy Jim,
who used to have the hots for dude was 

42
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,350
bawling.
Man.

43
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,273
He had mad whose skills was the 
president of every damn club and can 

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,220
even drive some ill rhymes.
Bang.

45
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,054
Show them changed because now he 
grinding away at the same broke ass job 

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,070
as time a man.
That stuff's lower.

47
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,123
Brossa them titties looking fine.
Then she dropped the big news that cat 

48
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,861
dropping by his Jim Laura wigs out so 
hard that when the boys arrived,

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,570
Loyola Chokes and got a dip out to 
another room.

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,750
Damn Law Jim and Tom to compensate by 
the White House apparently about the get

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,863
the poop,
but he already got plans to join the 

52
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,880
merchant.
Siemens young.

53
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,963
Matter of fact,
he signed up using a chat if he was 

54
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,174
opposed to pay the electric bill with 
Amanda buses in Jabber and again about 

55
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,690
how all the brothers wanted her back 
then and it's all sipping and child with

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,700
till Bam.
The lights go out,

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,893
he's bought some candles and a man to 
tell Jim to pull up a glass of wine for 

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,673
Loehr.
Jim stopped throwing game that Laura 

59
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,660
calling her old fashioned type of girl 
and said he never noticed her Janki legs

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,350
back in high school.
Laura talking about school and her glass

61
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:45,930
collection.
When Jill said,

62
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,620
girl,
you so fly,

63
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,260
you don't even know it.
You just need some confidence.

64
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,050
Boom,
the Laura show him her favorite thing,

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,010
a glass Unicorn.

66
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,893
Jim,
here's somebody dropping some fresh 

67
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,890
beets nearby.
So we ask Lord a dance.

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,100
They bring it on the dance floor.
When crash,

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,700
that Unicorn gets busted,
rather beg,

70
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,410
and he got to build her confidence.
So he kissed her,

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,423
but then immediately recognizes he dumb 
dumb because turns out he getting 

72
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,254
married next month.
Damn Laura gives him the broken unicorn 

73
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,660
as a souvenir.
Ge thinks when a man that comes in,

74
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,680
just say,
Yo gotta bounce.

75
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,573
I'm engaged.
Thanks for the dinner and Unicorn 

76
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,304
though,
Amanda just about ourselves and starts 

77
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,610
getting crunk on time.
Say He made them look like fools.

78
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,680
Bring her home and engaged.
Man.

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,510
He ain't nothing but a selfish asshole 
who's head is always in the cloud.

80
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,120
Thompson's doses out of that trap to get
his adventure on,

81
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,550
but no matter how far you go,
you always thinking of his post system.

82
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,060
There's a play as a choice example of 
what my boys,

83
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,030
he will cause plastic bed and then the 
pet gang.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,940
Everything on stage,
I'm talking props,

85
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,830
sounds,
music,

86
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,950
lighting,
wrapping the phase that's gone on inside

87
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,890
the character's domes and then the glass
menagerie.

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,873
All that mess is showing how the feel 
family's dreams ain't jiving with 

89
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,780
reality.
Remember,

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,200
this crew got some fantasy world that 
they live in La,

91
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,000
spend her days chilling with her glass 
Menagerie,

92
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,510
creating a place where she ain't got to 
deal with all of them real life.

93
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,090
Ask Her mom,
always dogging her,

94
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,610
not being shy,
bugging out at school.

95
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,260
I could go on and play up at Williams 
getting on his plastic theater jam.

96
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,213
Describe the reality of Laura's 
situation by comparing her to that 

97
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,100
glass.
Just peaked the stage direction.

98
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:47,970
Be a fragile unearthly.
Prettiness has come out and Laura,

99
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,580
she is like a piece of translucent 
glass.

100
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,400
Touch by light,
given a momentary radiant,

101
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,410
not actionable,
mad last,

102
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,710
but that glass collection ain't the only
thing.

103
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:01,370
Wrapping Laura,
Laura recall blue roses because she is a

104
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:03,710
blue rose.
She mad sensitive,

105
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,673
always feeling blue and got a unique 
kind of beauty that you don't usually 

106
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,284
find in the hood that busy Amanda always
living in the past when she was a sexy 

107
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:17,210
southern Belle who could get any brother
with just one work.

108
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,223
Now she a single mom who got burned by 
some little bitch and is now living a 

109
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:22,794
bleak ass life.
That disparity between life in her mind 

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,713
and life on a real,
making her act like a damn fool like 

111
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,764
when her ugly ass was wearing a dress 
made for some young hoochies Tom Dream 

112
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,624
about writing and living an adventurous 
lifestyle since grinding at the 

113
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,314
warehouses Halloween boy talk smack to 
his mama and even boost cash from the 

114
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:44,414
family just to add flavor to his own 
game even though he peaced out to live 

115
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,340
the high life.

116
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,810
Surprise.
Surprise.

117
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,853
Sometimes your dreams get on by reality.
Boys do to become just as bunk as his 

118
00:06:56,731 --> 00:07:00,170
pads.
I was pursued by something all at once.

119
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:04,070
My sister touches my shoulder.
I turn around and look into her eyes.

120
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,143
Oh,
Laura,

121
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,640
Laura.
I tried to leave you behind me,

122
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,070
but I am more faithful than I intended 
to be.

123
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,203
Jim was top dog in high school,
but now he had low level scrub busting 

124
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:15,824
his ass at a warehouse,
but even he living in a world of Bush 

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,280
saying he taken public speaking courses 
that's going to shoot him to the top boy

126
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:25,814
please.
The only way these cats can escape the 

127
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:32,741
prison of their real lives is the lot of
themselves over and over until it sticks

128
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,260
t we'll slang and repetition all up in 
his tax.

129
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,123
To make that point,
Amanda always talking about some flower 

130
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:44,471
called John quills to bring her back to 
the good old days of attendance and rich

131
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:45,950
on dogs.

132
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,780
Our so lovely that country and may 
literally flooded with John quills.

133
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,720
That was the summer I had the craze for 
John Quinones.

134
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,150
John quinones became an absolute 
obsession.

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,500
Mother said,
honey,

136
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,423
there's no more room for John Quills,
and I still kept on bringing in more 

137
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,940
John quills whenever,
wherever I saw him,

138
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,020
I said,
stop,

139
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,040
stop.
I said,

140
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,450
John Quilts.
I made.

141
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,700
The young men helped me gather the John 
quills.

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,460
It was a joke.
Amanda,

143
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,580
her,
John Quills.

144
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,503
Finally,
there were no more advisors to hold 

145
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,694
them.
Every available space was filled with 

146
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,424
John quills town.
Keep dropping the words movies and move 

147
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,533
the shelly itching to escape this type 
of flow as a special kind of repetition 

148
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,340
called Politiken when you repeat,
whereas they got the same routes.

149
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,930
Yes,
movies.

150
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,850
