I'm talking famine,
poverty and energy.

8
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,931
Crisis Up das was I could go home player
to escape this whacked out world.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,260
Everybody live in a Vr game called the 
oasis.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,153
You can do anything up in here.
Get your learn on hustle at a job by 

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,340

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,430

grind.

13
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,264
When the Creator,
the oasis attempt bigger baller named 

14
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:54,774
James Halladay,
takes that long dirt nap and drives a 

15
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:02,100

brother say he hit an Easter egg,

16
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:06,360
you know asis and the first cat naps.
Three keys that are lots.

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:11,361
It gets all this fat stacks Monday for 
the next five years.

18
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:17,040
Homeys busting ass trying to find them 
keys and get on a big ass scoreboard.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,780
These pete's called gunters and they 
wild about the eighties and everything.

20
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,710
Holiday ain't nobody finds July.

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,600
Eighteen year old narrator.
Wait,

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,610
step up and crack the first clue.
See where they come from the hood,

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,170
so he straight up sas.
We're getting holidays,

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,890
cash money's one day way chilling.
In Latin class.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,730
We recognize the first key might be on 
this,

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,430
his school planets,
so homeboy teleport to the spot,

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,040
shakes off some traps wreck shop at a 
mini game and hell yeah,

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,680
he get decade.
He tried to book it to the next box when

29
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,230
he was into a famous painting named 
Artemis who weighed,

30
00:01:56,231 --> 00:02:00,360
been hot as balls dropped.
Turns out she'd been trying to beat that

31
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,910
mini game for weeks,
but just can't hack it.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,953
Wait,
give her a tip on a low and swings over 

33
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,700
to the next clue.
Do.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,713
Besides through another mini game like a
GE and opens up the first gate where he 

35
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,450
got to play.
Matthew Broderick in that eighties movie

36
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,284
war games.

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,720
That's my I did.
Dealing with that mess.

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,643
He gets the next clue soon enough where 
he got some company on that scoreboard 

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,740
arguments his homeboy age and two 
brothers named Dido and Shell toe on the

40
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:29,754
come up.
Some sites from a big ass corporation 

41
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:37,041
called Ili start blowing up Wade's inbox
saying they want to meet these haters,

42
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:38,514
a call sixers,
and the only thing on their mind is 

43
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,514
making bank off the oasis way decided he
wanted to meet the top dog Sorento who 

44
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,770
offers ways,
some mad grants to stop playing for that

45
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,030
team.
When you say,

46
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,560
Nah Bro,
I'm straight,

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,423
Sorento safe.
They know where he lives and they're 

48
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,460
gonna.
Blow it to hell.

49
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,040
Since Wade's real body is in his 
hideout,

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,240
he just shake that.
Hey,

51
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:04,870
the off then boom is up.
These trailer go up in smoke and a bunch

52
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,660
of innocents get to murked skirt is 
hell.

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,583
Wait,
Holla at his homeys and when the timer 

54
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,083
what went down,
they all wigged out so when he skips 

55
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,610
town and lays low by taking a new name 
while trying to crack the next clue,

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,870
the simpsons try to isolate and he gets 
his wool on with Artemis,

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,250
but probably moving a little too fairs,
so artemis got to shut them down.

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,010
Rookie move,
wait a couple of months.

59
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,220
Go by and ways doing what I call the 
post breakup.

60
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,690
Hustle,
work out,

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,180
stay busy,
and by size dog,

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,073
what else do you need?
He ain't no closer to finding a second 

63
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,314
key when out of nowhere are the it with 
a little help from age way connects the 

64
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:46,714
dots and books into a planet where he go
hard at a game of PAC man and wins a 

65
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,680
quarter boy thing.
This is a little Easter egg,

66
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,130
so he pocketed wave slides over to 
another planet.

67
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,280
Takes down again and get that second 
key,

68
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,510
so a good till they get word that the 
sixes ghosted Dido and real life man,

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,100
that ain't good.
Yo Sunni boosters,

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,120
the third key and rolls over to the spot
where the Easter egg going to be a whole

71
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,254
gang of census.
It's posted up right outside the castle 

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,890
so he comes up with the plan.
I got by the police,

73
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,060
Wade hats until the Ioi to boost some 
scandalous evidence,

74
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,120
mess with their shield and then blows 
that joint.

75
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,203
He hit up arguments shadow an h,
telling them to bail because the Ili is 

76
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,504
looking to offer them in the real world.
They all meet in the chat room and 

77
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,200
conversation about how they're going to 
take down the sixes.

78
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,400
They need all the hoods and all waste is
the crew up with them and this bike,

79
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,383
so we sent out a message to everybody 
telling them when they gonna throw down 

80
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,740
why they plot holidays.

81
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,100
Pottnam la rose shows up in the chat 
room and say he been creeping on him.

82
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,203
He sent everybody some slinky planes to 
Harlem to his credit when they ready to 

83
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:13,240
bang out and she'll veils and a bunch of
gunters and 16 start scrapping.

84
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,800
The six is drop a bomb.
Cool.

85
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,720
Everybody dies.
Sab.

86
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,930
Wait a little bit that courtney got.
Turns out it wasn't extra life,

87
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,710
so he keeps hassling.
He wrecks another game and plays King,

88
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:27,544
author in that movie with the coconuts 
after busting through some other 

89
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,534
challenges.
He finally gets the East Egg holidays 

90
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,090
character shows up and say,
yo,

91
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,103
reality can be raw as hell,
but it's the only place you can find 

92
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,890
happiness because reality is real.
You feel me?

93
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,980
So rental gets thrown in the clink and 
way,

94
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,740
going to see as bad check with his 
homies.

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Then Wade and the Ottomans Hook up in 
the real world and finally kiss a year.

96
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,770
One thing that's always going on about 
it's escaping from the horrible bulls in

97
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,860
your life.
Everybody's lives are so funny that they

98
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:12,950
all hold up inside a video game the 
game.

99
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,784
Don't just give them a different world,
but one that let people shine and live 

100
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,194
life on the easy.
It ain't just people getting their 

101
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,880
marbles off by losing themselves in 
another world,

102
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,460
but also by losing themselves in the 
past.

103
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,683
Everybody in his book always geeked up 
about their eighties and shit from PAC 

104
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:34,670
man and a young matty be Nah.
Not that one to monty python,

105
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,620
but no run DMC,
man.

106
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:40,100
That's some bullshit.
If your head always living in the past,

107
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
how are you going to create new ideas?
Man,

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,473
he supposed to fully live.
Truth is sometimes by trying to escape 

109
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:48,194
one trap,
people actually end up creating another 

110
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:50,924
one.
I've come to see my rig for what it was 

111
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,950
and elaborate contraption for receiving 
my census to allow me to live in a world

112
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,030
that didn't exist.

113
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,040
Each component of my rig was a bar and 
the sale where I had willingly in prison

114
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:08,150
myself in real life,
I was nothing but an anti social hermit.

115
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,520
I was just another sad,
lost,

116
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,354
lonely soul,
wasted his life on a glorified video 

117
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,464
game.
So it's this kind of future technology 

118
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,670
banging a busted.
Well,

119
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,410
on the one hand,
they're always.

120
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,900
His players can get all the knowledge 
they want.

121
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,793
I'm talking free information,
free schooling and the ability to 

122
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:30,050
compensate with homies all over the 
world,

123
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,630
but on the other hand,
if you don't check yourself,

124
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,710
you could end up isolating yourself from
any meaningful connections.

125
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,490
So it's the always is a utopia or 
dystopia.

126
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,750
Well,
it'd be real.

127
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,643
That ass ain't so easy.
They'll always give Paul struggling 

128
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,471
folks access to education and jobs.
Since there ain't none on the outside,

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,553
but that also means that they are 
ignoring all the mess happening around 

130
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:58,470
them in the real world,
which only makes that reality rock dish.

131
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,020
It's like there's a utopia or dystopia.
You fill me in a real world way.

132
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,640
They ain't got no friends,
no benjamins and no respect,

133
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,220
but in the oasis.
Got a solid wrap,

134
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
a nice cash flow,
and a loyal crew.

135
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,394
I mean,
just check this one sec way jabbering 

136
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:19,040
about how horrible is things used to be 
awesome,

137
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,150
but now they're kind of terrifying.
Human civilization is in decline.

138
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,043
Some people even say is collapsing.
Then he started talking about his life 

139
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,890
like it's all tight and shit.
Luckily I had access to the oasis,

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,400
which was like having an escape hatch 
into a better reality.

141
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,323
It was my playground and my preschool,
a magical place where anything was 

142
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,184
possible.
The Oasis is the setting of all my 

143
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:43,544
happiest Childhood Memories,
so as escape the answer to living in a 

144
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,044
jacked up world,
is it better to kick back and live a 

145
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:53,270
decent life and a fake world are be on 
the struggle.

146
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,103
In reality.
Maybe we should time Kaphar reality and 

147
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:57,984
make it the place to be rather than just
giving up and piece them out to 

148
