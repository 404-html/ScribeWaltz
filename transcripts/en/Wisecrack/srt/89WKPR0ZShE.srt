1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,421
Hey,
wise,

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,310
crack,
fleshy,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,153
jared again,
and today we're breaking down season 

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,280
three,
episode nine of Rick and Morty,

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,060
the abcs of Beth.
This episode is one of my favorites,

6
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:17,061
not only because it develops Beth in 
some interesting ways,

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,940
but because it builds on a theme from 
way back in another season.

8
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:25,941
Three favorite pick on that idea,
the importance of choice.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,310
Welcome this wise crack quick take on 
the abcs of Beth.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,990
First,
a quick recap.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,480
The father of Beth's adolescent friend,
Tommy.

12
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,190
It's about to be put to death for 
eating.

13
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,600
His son that's soon realizes her 
childhood fantasy of fruit.

14
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,850
De Leon was not some mechanism to cope 
with her friend's death,

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,743
but a very real place built by rick to 
keep her sociopathic tendencies out of 

16
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,030
his way.
Also,

17
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,970
Tommy has built a kingdom on incest and 
cannibalism.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,870
I suppose you're wondering,
how do I sustain myself?

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,920
Oh boy,
we aren't.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,560
Meanwhile,
Jerry has a new alien girlfriend,

21
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,394
Kiarra and things are moving fast.
Does your planet have shorter days 

22
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,920
because you guys are moving kind of 
fast?

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,750
No,
Jerry decides to break up with her,

24
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,584
but isn't able to take responsibility 
for his decision and blames his kid 

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,263
after kid tries to murder morning in 
summer for allegedly causing the 

26
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,684
breakup.
Jerry finally owns up to his actions in 

27
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,630
the abcs of Beth,
the A and b plots parallel each other.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,673
We have Beth Cherry and even greg 
unwilling to take responsibility for 

29
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:27,024
their choices.
Beth refuses to acknowledge sentencing 

30
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,710
Tommy to a life of humping teletubby.
Tommy,

31
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm sorry.
You think you deserve an apology.

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,370
And Rick Denies Building for Upi land to
avoid being emotionally available to his

33
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,140
daughter.
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,153
You think you deserve an apology?
Whereas Jerry refuses to take 

35
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,610
responsibility for ending his toxic 
relationship with Kiarra.

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,130
So what does all this have to do with 
pickle rick?

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,360
Well,
this

38
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,293
and I think it's because the only truly 
unapproachable concept for you is that 

39
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:59,860
it's your mind within your control.
You chose to come here.

40
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,694
You chose to talk to belittle my 
vocation just as you chose to become a 

41
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,550
pickle.
Each of us gets to choose.

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,683
As we've mentioned before,
this season is playing a lot with the 

43
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,624
ideas of agency freedom and most 
importantly choice as Dr Wong noted in 

44
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:16,564
brick managing the stone.
Morty is angry at his father for having 

45
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:19,654
no agency standing in the driveway.
Talking about company can either tell 

46
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,600
her you want to stay married or get on 
with your life,

47
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:29,170
but whatever you do,
stop being a baby in pickle.

48
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,004
Rick.
Rick literally gives up his freedom by 

49
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:36,661
becoming a pickle and elaborate ruse to 
avoid therapy in the Rick Landis mixup.

50
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,300
We see what happens when ricks give up 
their freedom and of course in the world

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,200
early conspiracy.
One of my favorite moments in the season

52
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,034
is this advice to jerry,
but there comes a time in every man's 

53
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:51,020
life when he must choose the foundation 
on which his legacy will be built.

54
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,730
What of compromise one of blood in our 
pickle.

55
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,063
Quick take.
We talked about how some of the ideas 

56
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,720
represented their mirror.
John Paul Sartre,

57
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:07,330
idea of bad faith for a very quick 
refresher.

58
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,373
Bad faith is when we negate the radical 
freedom we are afforded in our ability 

59
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,360
to make choices.
In a sense,

60
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:18,361
we choose not to choose after she 
realizes she's no different than God.

61
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,110
I'm my father.
Beth has an identity crisis to head.

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,950
I'm out of excuses to not be who I am.
So who am I?

63
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,293
What do I do?
So how do to Sanchez is cursed with 

64
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,760
intelligence,
find meaning and an uncaring world.

65
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,380
Am I evil?
Worse?

66
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,780
You're smart when you know nothing 
matters.

67
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,910
The Universe is yours and I've never met
a universe that was into it.

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,200
Rick's conversation reflects on some 
upstarts points for sorry.

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,123
The whole problem of our existence 
starts with the fact that there is no 

70
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,140
inherent meaning and departing from 
Sarta bit.

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,213
Any attempt to draw meaning from the 
universe will be met with cosmic 

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,880
indifference.
You know,

73
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,680
smart people get a chance to climb on 
top,

74
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,650
take reality for a ride,
but it'll never stop trying to throw you

75
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,680
and eventually it will.
There's no other way off for rick.

76
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,543
Those smart enough get to take reality 
for a ride before they too are 

77
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,610
inevitably thrown off.
Or in other words,

78
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,830
they can indulge in whatever they 
desire,

79
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,320
but when reality catches up with them,
well,

80
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,154
we've seen it before with rick best 
feels trapped by her family and her 

81
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,870
arguably ironic attachment to abc,
to bachelor's.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,833
She readily denies her own freedom and 
thus the choices available to her with 

83
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,050
the facts of her existence can't do 
that.

84
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,213
The kids,
jerry my job and as much as I hate to 

85
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:32,824
admit it,
ABC's the Bachelor Rick Solution isn't 

86
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,194
to free her necessarily,
but to give her a choice can make a 

87
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:42,400
clone of you a perfect instance of view 
with all your memories and exact copy in

88
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,770
every way and 11,
provide for the kids.

89
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,360
Do your job and consume broadcast 
network reality TV on the same allegedly

90
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,490
ironic level as you.
You could be gone a day,

91
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,190
a week or the rest of your life with 
zero consequences.

92
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,460
The moment you decided to come back,
I flipped a switch and the clumps job is

93
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,980
done.
It feels no pain,

94
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,853
regrets nothing,
and has zero chance of going blade 

95
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,910
runner.
The important thing here is rick doesn't

96
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,773
argue that she should do this,
but says then stay and luxuriate in a 

97
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,760
life you can finally know you've chosen 
my secret bonuses,

98
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,603
that no matter what you choose,
you're finally going to chill the fuck 

99
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,370
out.
In other words,

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,040
it's not whether she takes rick up on 
the clone or not,

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,620
but the fact that she makes a choice 
that matters.

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,633
The prospect of the clone confronts Beth
with her absolute freedom and just by 

103
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,014
putting her in this crossroads,
rick is prompting her to choose her 

104
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:30,364
identity.

105
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,203
So no matter what she chooses,
the choice brings resolved or her 

106
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:37,330
identity crisis.
So maybe Rick has learned something from

107
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,164
Dr Wong afterall.
We can split hairs on reddit forums for 

108
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,510
hours on whether or not Beth decided to 
take rick's offer,

109
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:47,110
but it doesn't really matter whether or 
not Beth abandoned her family.

110
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,190
It's the fact that she chose that will 
ultimately help her find meaning.

111
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,380
So what about evil?
Jerry?

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,870
He claims he is an evil but just a 
tower.

113
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,560
Meanwhile,
rick tells Beth,

114
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,210
she's not evil,
just smart,

115
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,253
but are we to believe rick or is this 
for intelligence used to justify 

116
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,900
sickness?
To quote Dr Wall after all,

117
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,763
Rick built a magical play place for his 
sociopathic child just to avoid dealing 

118
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,234
with her inherited problems.
