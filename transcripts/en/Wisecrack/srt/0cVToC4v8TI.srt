1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,863
Hey wise,
crack jared again and today we're 

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,590
talking about everyone's favorite anime 
with an uncomfortable amount of underage

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,443
crotch fondling a curatory,
Aamas enduring and much beloved dragon 

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,200
ball.
Dragon ball may appear to be little more

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:18,390
than a run of the mill adventure show 
for kids.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
The series and it's spinoffs actually 
have roots in some pretty hefty 

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,710
philosophical material.
Many fans are aware that in creating the

8
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,544
earliest episodes of Dragon Ball,
Toyama drew inspiration from a 500 year 

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:30,624
old Chinese classic journey to the West.
These superficial similarities are easy 

10
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,830
to spot.
Both feature a group of four adventurers

11
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,390
in search of powerful magical objects 
among them,

12
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,550
a monkey like creature with a magic 
staff,

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,980
a horny piggish looking fellow,
et cetera.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,250
Often overlooked,
however is the fact that dragon ball,

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,300
much like journey to the West can be 
read as an explicitly Buddhist allegory.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,380
Indeed a show that many of us watched in
our underwear on Saturday mornings while

17
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,214
wolfing down cookie,
Chris offers a surprising take on 

18
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,930
fundamental elements of Buddhist 
doctrine.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,033
Welcome his wise crack addition on the 
philosophy of dragon ball and note to 

20
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:05,904
the die hard fans keeping score at home.
Since a full discussion of the extended 

21
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,990
Dragon Ball universe would take quite a 
while.

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,883
Today we'll focus mainly on the episodes
of the original animate most heavily 

23
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,364
influenced by journey to the west,
the 13 episodes comprising the emperor 

24
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,340
loft saga.
But first a quick refresher.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,413
Dragonball follows Goku a young boy with
a monkey tale and superhuman strength 

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,003
and Bouma a girl who plans to collect 
the dragon balls in order to wish for a 

27
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,570
new boyfriend.
Along the way,

28
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:35,050
the team up with oolong a shape shifting
pig and yum cha,

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,050
a desert dwelling band that with a 
crippling fear of women,

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,313
they are in a race against time to 
collect all seven dragon balls before 

31
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:44,410
the evil emperor Pilaf can snag them for
himself.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,393
At the last moment when Pilaf has 
gathered all the dragon balls and it's 

33
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:48,904
about to wish for world domination,
Oolong saves the day by sabotaging his 

34
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:52,700
wish.

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,533
I want to have no world.
The world's most cocky about parallel 

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,233
track

37
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,843
journey to the west follows trip,
hit tikka a Buddhist monk and his three 

38
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:05,950
disciples,
monkey pigs,

39
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:06,784
he and sandy on their quest to locate 
and bring back sacred Buddhist scrolls 

40
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:10,874
to the Chinese court.
When the pilgrims arrived at the 

41
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:13,184
Buddhist paradise,
the scrolls they received out to be 

42
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:16,064
completely blank.
While journey to the West involves 

43
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:20,180
character searching for a magical 
object,

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,270
there's more to it than your basic 
annoying fetch quests.

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,880
The novel is often read as a Buddhist 
allegory,

46
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,010
one concerned with spiritual 
enlightened.

47
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,143
The characters move from a place of 
ignorance to one of insight as they get 

48
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:34,400
closer to their destination.
Surprisingly enough,

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,360
the same applies to dragonball.
Both Dragon Ball and journey to the West

50
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,194
have their philosophical grounding.
In Mahayana Buddhism de Vastly 

51
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,824
oversimplified the Mayana approach to 
Buddhism is distinguished from the 

52
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:46,244
earlier teravata school.
Nice emphasis on the collective 

53
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:52,880
enlightenment of all sentient beings in 
the universe rather than that of any one

54
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,714
individual.

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,703
Accordingly,
dragon ball puts a premium on acts of 

56
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,344
compassion and on the growth of the 
group as a when the heroes are dragging 

57
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,750
a ball.
Put others first.

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,613
They advance in their quest when they 
act selfishly and refuse to see things 

59
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,650
from other's point of view.
Their progress is delayed.

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,753
In the second episode,
Goku and Boma encounter a beach turtle 

61
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,024
who explains that he's lost.
I wish there was a way we could help 

62
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,630
you.
Hey,

63
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,464
I know.
What do you like me to carry you to the 

64
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,260
scene?
Mr Turtle while go,

65
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,470
who wants to put their journey on hold 
in order to help the turtle?

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,680
Boma wants to get right back to her 
quest to find the dragon ball.

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,753
We're on an adventure.
We don't have time to transport a beach 

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,060
turtle.
Okay.

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
However,
go coups.

70
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,034
Active compassion unexpectedly turns out
to be the most direct route to the next 

71
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,760
dragonball.
Enter master Roshi hermit and pervert.

72
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,594
Extraordinary Roshi is grateful to go Ku
for returning the turtle to the sea and 

73
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:47,380
gives Goku his iconic flying Nimbus 
cloud as a reward.

74
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,403
You also happens to own a dragon ball,
which he's willing to give the boma and 

75
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:52,270
exchange for.
Well,

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,410
it's a weird show guys.
The ethical implications of trading peep

77
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:05,850
shows for magical jewelry aside.
The fact remains that Boba and Goku find

78
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:09,860
the dragonball because Goku is willing 
to delay his own gratification and rover

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,703
to help out a fellow being in need.
So aren't you glad we decided to help 

80
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:15,870
the turtle now it paid off.

81
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,990
I sure am.
You are so right.

82
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,330
You don't have that.
I think about it as the series goes on.

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,193
Goku spends a lot of time dragging 
around his useless childhood friends 

84
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,400
while doing all the world.
Yeah,

85
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm looking at you.
Crillon did that ain't compassion.

86
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,990
I'm not sure.
What is this correlation between ethical

87
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:33,824
behavior and speed of progress is lifted
straight from journey to the West in 

88
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:41,120
which a lack of compassion on part of 
the pilgrims causes delays that can only

89
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:43,520
be resolved through compassion and 
understanding.

90
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,623
Monkey often gets in fights with 
monsters only to realize that those 

91
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,254
monsters were supposed to help him.
Both Peggy and sandy start out his foes 

92
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,603
only to eventually become allies.
This goes part of the way toward 

93
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,174
explaining early dragon balls,
unexpected attitude toward violence for 

94
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:01,520
a franchise that would eventually go on 
to features,

95
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,160
scenes such as this,
this,

96
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,630
this,
this,

97
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,893
and this.

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,793
Dragon ball and its earliest episodes as
a surprising lack of violence like 

99
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,904
journey to the west.
The show is preoccupied with a 

100
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,100
particular Buddhist conception of 
nonviolence.

101
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,490
Violence is not universally wrong so 
much as it is cumbersome to some degree.

102
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,800
It does get in the way of insight.
Conversely,

103
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:32,440
compassion facilitates spiritual 
progress.

104
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,460
This understanding of violence as 
roadblock is most clearly displayed with

105
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,950
the ox cake.
When the group first meets the ox,

106
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,784
King Goku tries to beat him up in order 
to clear the pathway of Fire Mountain 

107
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,863
and take his dragon ball.
The enormous man barely feels go cruise 

108
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,734
attacks for the duration of this fight.
Everyone involved is stuck in an 

109
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,603
unproductive,
pointless cycle that gets the pilgrims 

110
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,604
nowhere.
It is only when Goku and the ox king 

111
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,394
begin to each other's needs through 
conversation that the team gets any 

112
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,244
closer to their goal.
We are collecting these and I think you 

113
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,604
have one.

114
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,500
I think I've seen one in my cousin so of
course you could have it.

115
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,920
My new little friend,
compassion and understanding rather than

116
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,770
violence lead to the trade that 
eventually nets the team.

117
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,604
Another dragon ball,
which is all well and good when you're 

118
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,950
dealing with a scary but ultimately 
harmless threat like the ox king.

119
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,520
But how should our heroes approach a 
threat that can't be reasoned with?

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,710
According to writer Paul,
our Fleischman,

121
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,573
the Buddhist approach to nonviolence 
makes room for this kind of scenario as 

122
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,294
he says,
permitting someone else to perpetrate 

123
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,980
harm without consequences is not 
nonviolence.

124
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,910
Defending innocent lives with violent 
means is hardly ideal,

125
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,290
but it's preferable to rigid pacifism.
And the last few episodes of the emperor

126
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,124
p Loft Saga,
the team is confronted with an 

127
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:51,560
existential threat when Goku turns into 
a giant ape at the site of the full moon

128
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,120
and threatens to eat boma.

129
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,103
So Yom Chupp wore an oolong cutoff.
Go coos tail to safe Boma and stop Goku 

130
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,660
from doing something he'd later regret.
They're limited use of violence prevents

131
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:06,470
worst violence down the road.
This way at least nobody dies.

132
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,453
This more nuanced understanding of 
violence would pop up in Torrey aamas 

133
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:11,024
later work as well.
Listen to go description of himself in 

134
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:15,600
response to freeze his question.
Hello,

135
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,120
how are you?
Hi,

136
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,954
I'm the hope of the universe.
I am the answer to all living things 

137
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:24,660
that cry out for peace.
I am protector of the innocent.

138
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,750
I am the light in the darkness.
I am true nightmare.

139
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,293
Unlike the various villains that maim 
and murder throughout the series go Ku 

140
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,344
commits violent acts to preserve peace.
Perhaps most interesting is how dragon 

141
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,670
ball handles the Buddhist concept of 
empties.

142
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,603
The idea that things in themselves,
how no inherent or fixed essence early 

143
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,134
on Toyama asks us to consider this 
concept in relation to the dragon balls 

144
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,173
are these gems have the power to do 
great things and not so great from the 

145
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,390
start.

146
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,660
The series points out that the dragon 
balls are neither inherently good,

147
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,523
bad or anything in between there simply 
a store of potential energy use to 

148
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:09,220
fulfill wishes even so the hero's revere
them as a life changing miracles.

149
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,243
Their disposition toward the dragon 
balls mirrors the pilgrims attitude 

150
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:15,200
toward the sacred scrolls in journey to 
the west.

151
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,680
When the Buddha's assistants actually 
give them scrolls that are blank,

152
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,070
they are more than a little pissed off,
but they shouldn't be.

153
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,143
Scholar Andrew,
who we are used at the blankness of the 

154
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:25,844
scrolls,
is a material manifestation of the 

155
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,184
Buddhist doctrine of emptiness assigned 
pointing to the nature of ultimate 

156
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,474
reality.
The Buddha himself explains to the 

157
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,664
pilgrims that as a matter of fact,
it is such blank scrolls as these that 

158
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,030
are the true scriptures by undercutting 
their expectations.

159
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,893
The Buddha provides the pilgrims with a 
profound lesson about the nature of 

160
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,284
reality,
namely that it's empty of any inherent 

161
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,020
essence.

162
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,853
In this way,
the prank actually advances their 

163
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,254
spiritual progress.
A similar bait and switch occurs in 

164
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,500
dragon ball.
Remember,

165
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,403
oolongs panty wish by ruining pilafs 
wish oolong undercuts the hero's 

166
00:08:59,011 --> 00:08:59,844
expectations,
turning something as momentous as the 

167
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,620
summoning of the eternal dragon into a 
joke.

168
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,190
While the dragon balls may have provided
oolong with a pair of Panties,

169
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,220
they haven't changed anyone's life in 
any meaningful way,

170
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,720
which is not to say the journey was for 
nothing far from it in both the show and

171
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,554
the novel.
The revelation of the quests inherent 

172
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,133
emptiness serves as a catalyst for 
growth beyond what the characters 

173
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,763
expected.
In the final chapters of journey to the 

174
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,344
west,
the pilgrims are made into high ranking 

175
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,444
members of the Buddhist Paradise while 
the heroes of dragon ball gain insight 

176
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,760
into the true scope of their various 
problems,

177
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,850
which turned out to be not as terrible 
or permanent as they thought.

178
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,923
Boma and Yom Cha plan to use the dragon 
balls to find a boyfriend and cure 

179
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:44,070
social anxiety respectively.
But after long pulses stunt they realize

180
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,640
the solution to their mutual problem has
been in front of them the whole time.

181
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,713
They agree to get together on the spot.
Bobo lets go of her need for perfection 

182
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,770
and Yom sure lets go of his fear.
Even Oolong who we first meet kidnapping

183
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,604
young girls to staff his would be Harem 
has learned to find happiness in 

184
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,560
thinking about others.
Besides himself.

185
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,710
When asked whether he will accompany Yom
trying boma to the city,

186
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,240
he says,
Oh wow,

187
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,550
I guess I'll go.
You guys need me.

188
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,980
So turtles flashing panties and more.
All in all a pretty weird way of getting

189
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,920
a religious message across.
But that's kind of the point.

190
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,330
My Yana Buddhism with its emphasis on 
teaching and collective enlightenment is

191
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,164
big into the concept of skillful means 
or the guiding of Cindy and beings 

192
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,800
toward enlightenment according to their 
current abilities and other words,

193
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,420
meeting people where they're at.

194
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,523
One way to meet people where they're at 
is to dispense with the dry lecturing 

195
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,393
and tell them a damn good story and this
is exactly what dragon ball and journey 

196
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,804
to the west do with engaging plotlines 
creative characters and writing that is 

197
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,424
alternatively tense and hilarious.
Dragonball successfully weaves Buddhist 

198
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:48,984
morals into a story that people love to 
come back to again and again and it's 

199
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:57,210
bad as thanks for watching wise crack

from.

201
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,410
Ap Checkout verb,
that's VRV.

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,513
