1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,743
Silicon Valley has been a strong 
intellectual resource to us in putting 

2
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,580
together I innovation agenda.
In fact,

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,803
our discussions began at Stanford 
University and when we put the 

4
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,304
innovation agenda together,
it became clear that a energy security 

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:21,274
was it competitiveness issue.
It's not only a national security issue 

6
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,860
for our country and an economic issue,
it's a competitiveness issue.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,143
So right from the start,
as we put the innovation agenda 

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,683
together,
silicon valley was there from the start 

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,320
and on energy.
Of course,

10
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:40,321
the green momentum that is a,
a springing forth from Silicon Valley.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,793
Is there an important.
Because if we're going to succeed with 

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,870
our new green economy and with our,
our,

13
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:47,704
um,
addressing climate crisis and energy 

14
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:52,780
security,
we have to have the marketplace,

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,160
uh,
lead the way.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,113
So when we see Silicon Valley with all 
the invention and ingenuity and 

17
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:03,811
discovery plus all of the venture 
capital flowing toward that,

18
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,380
we know that we can be successful.
