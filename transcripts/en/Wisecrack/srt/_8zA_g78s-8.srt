1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,550
I'm not saying that religion can't ever 
be useful or inspire good things,

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,600
it's certainly can and has and,
and will,

3
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:24,750
and that's,
that's a better than the alternative,

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,643
but there's a distinction we have to 
recognize there's a distinction between 

5
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,670
something being true and so they'd been 
useful and every religion,

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,133
every benign religion,
every religion that's actually helping 

7
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,440
somebody sometimes could be functioning 
like a placebo.

8
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,080
I mean,
it could be,

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,913
it could be totally barren of content 
and still useful in certain 

10
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,234
circumstances.
I couldn't invent a religion right now 

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,960
which we know is not true and would be 
extremely useful if I could spread it to

12
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:56,040
billions invented right now.
Just this religion is,

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,320
um,
the principles are,

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,630
do your best to love your neighbor and 
you and your family and every person you

15
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,010
meet,
uh,

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,383
encourage your children to study science
and mathematics to the best of their 

17
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,554
abilities.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,590
Um,
and if you don't do this,

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,700
you will be punished for eternity by 17 
demons after death.

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,463
Now,
I have no doubt that if I could spread 

21
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:23,520
this to billions,
this would be a better religion than the

22
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,354
religions we've got.
It will be better than Christianity and 

23
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,070
Judaism and Islam.
You'd have no suicide bombers.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,083
What you would have is a generation of 
children bearing down on science and 

25
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,060
mathematics to the best of their 
abilities,

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,103
encouraged by their otherwise ethical 
parents all under the the compulsion of 

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,820
do this or else the 17 demons will 
torture you for eternity.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,380
Does this with the usefulness of this?
I mean this.

29
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,390
We would,
we would live in a much better world.

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,480
No question.
The usefulness of this.

31
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:00,510
Would this suggest for a moment that 
these 17 demons actually exist?

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,170
Would it,
would it provide a reason to believe in,

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,810
in these 17 demons,
a not even slightly.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,240
So that's,
that's the divide here.

35
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:09,990
There's,
there's,

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,823
there's a big difference between the 
utility of an idea or the consoling 

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,720
nature of an idea.
I mean,

38
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:19,560
the idea that God has a plan for me or 
everything happens for a reason,

39
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,394
and the idea that these are consoling is
quite distinct from whether there are 

40
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,300
good reasons to believe right.
