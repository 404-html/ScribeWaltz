1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,840
Well ebooks or another method of taxed 
delivery.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,420
Uh,
and I did run a,

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,083
I ran a blog on the subject sometime ago
and it was called three reasons for 

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,800
keeping paper books and the three 
reasons were uh,

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,843
solar flares,
which would wipe out communications 

6
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,084
towers and not so well any electronic 
media that you might happen to have a 

7
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,340
stored,
um,

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,073
grand overload resulting in brownouts 
which would have similar effects and 

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,023
internet overload and less people are 
going to build the grid out more and to 

10
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:40,884
build the net out more.
And there's pretty soon not going to be 

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,830
very much based on it because of all the
spam and torn,

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,570
um,
to the,

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,380
to the percentage of 95 I'm told.
So it was very crowded there.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,963
So building out the nat,
building up the grid and what are you 

15
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,070
going to do about the solar flare as 
well?

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,070
I guess a lead lined box is about the 
best you can do all of these things.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,150
Point out the fact that electronic 
storage is pretty fragile.

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,450
If you want to keep something 
permanently,

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,300
you should probably keep it in paper 
form.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,930
And that is why an e version of your 
will is not acceptable.

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,010
And the reason is it's very hackable and
forageable as I said,

22
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:28,840
the net is leaky,
uh,

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,723
and a number of other legal documents,
which of course drives people crazy 

24
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,510
because those paper things take up so 
much room.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,440
So it's a problem facing businesses.
What to do with the paper,

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,190
why does the alternative to paper,
when can he is a storage,

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,160
et cetera.
It's also a problem for people.

28
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,770
For instance,
with small apartments who liked to read,

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,050
where are they going to put all the 
books?

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,860
The ereader gives you portability,
it gives you instant accessibility,

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,863
uh,
and it gives you the possibility of 

32
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:11,220
having a whole bunch of books with you 
at once on this little device.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
So for that it's very,
very handy.

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,533
Those are the pluses.
I personally think that it's going to 

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,370
increase rating because you can acquire 
about very quickly,

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
you don't have to go,
you don't have to wait.

37
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,990
If you could just push the button and 
it's there.

38
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,870
If you really like it and want to keep 
it,

39
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,704
you may then go get a paper version.
It does remove the element of 

40
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,684
serendipity w by which I mean you walk 
into a bookstore with the idea of 

41
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,694
getting this book and just say three or 
four other books that you really feel 

42
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,494
you must have,
but you wouldn't have known about them 

43
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,010
unless you went into the store.
So how to,

44
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,050
how to create and an e version,
that experience of serendipity,

45
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,690
it's,
it's really hard.

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,210
So people are thinking about this.
There's a lot.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,870
The other virtue of the ereader may be 
that it's,

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,300
but it's helpful for,
um,

49
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,660
kids are having reading problems because
they can isolate blocks of text and make

50
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,630
the letters bigger.
