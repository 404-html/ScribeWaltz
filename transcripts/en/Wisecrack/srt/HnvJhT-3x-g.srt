00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,070
This video is brought to you by 
Skillshare,

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,850
a wise crack.
Jared,

3
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,950
again,
are you one of the million spending your

4
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:10,784
evenings as a digital dark elf,
shotgunning strangers in the world's 

5
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:15,350
most popular video game,
or if not,

6
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:16,184
are you wondering why everyone won't 
shut up about the fluorescent cartoon 

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,230
version of Pub g?
Whether you're a fortnight fan or not,

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,123
you might have a more pressing question.
How the hell was this free game making 

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,070
billions of dollars?
You might think you know the answer,

10
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:31,010
but here's something you might not have 
considered for night,

11
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,710
isn't making money in spite of the fact 
that it's free.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,590
It's making money because it's free.
Also,

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,453
it's stupendous.
Success might aluminate one of the 

14
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:41,690
fundamental tenants of the modern 
economy,

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,793
so climb off your Air Force One and 
button up your virtual bridges as we 

16
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:45,914
break down the economics of fortnight.
For those of you living under a 

17
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:49,664
pixelated rock fortnight is a battle 
royale style shooter where you hunger 

18
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:56,480
games or weighted the finale in hopes of
being the last cat standing.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,290
You can also play in squads or 50 slash 
50.

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,343
It sets itself apart from the other 
battle royale games with it's more 

21
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:06,920
colorful and cartoonish style and the 
ability to build things like a murderous

22
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:07,940
minecraft.
Oh,

23
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:11,300
and also everything is free.
The game is free to download.

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,180
The weapons are free and you don't even 
need an inexpensive console.

25
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:15,014
Since you can play online on a potato.
This essentially makes the game 

26
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,330
available to everyone with access to a 
computer,

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,313
but fortnights producer,
epic games is making staggering amounts 

28
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:26,660
of money.
In May of this year alone,

29
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,523
they made $318,000,000.
That's enough for Elon musk to launch 

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,240
five rockets to space.
In other words,

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,850
it's a ton.
Not surprisingly fortnight,

32
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:42,410
makes its money on in game purchases.
Usually it's in game currency vbox.

33
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,900
We're going to assume the V stands for 
virtual,

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,990
not vapid,
vacant or vacuous because what does this

35
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:48,824
virtual cash gets you?
Bad ass weaponry to slay your foes or 

36
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:55,370
super powerful armor to protect you from
the bad men trying to teabag you.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,450
Nope.
You know what?

38
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,284
You can buy dances and shiny things,
functionless armor and different 

39
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,150
characters.
In fact,

40
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:05,870
you can buy all the bad ass,
silly or individualized you want,

41
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,823
but it's all purely cosmetic.
We all know lots of games manipulate us 

42
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,360
into buying things.

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,870
It pays the payer with a skimper game 
loop.

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,763
Use Lots of flashing into things and 
condiments to make the player feel good 

45
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:17,794
about themselves.
Train the players to spend your 

46
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,853
currency.
Offer the payers away to spend real 

47
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,344
currency for your picker,
and so they'll forget that are spending 

48
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,640
money and make the game about waiting,
but let the player base,

49
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,523
not the wheat.
It's a surefire way to make lots of 

50
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:31,630
money.

51
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,463
That's not news,
but fortnight is different than other 

52
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,494
free to play games where you can buy 
stuff that actually you know helps you 

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,633
in those games.
Free to play is essentially paid when 

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,013
why?
Wait 20 hours for your fortress to 

55
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:44,914
upgrade.
If you can speed it up for ninety nine 

56
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,510
cents,
but fortnight insists on equal access to

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,820
all players.
Even if you suck,

58
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,000
oh my God,
okay,

59
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,270
this is that.
This is better than another.

60
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,420
Really,
dude,

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,330
making sure that none of the purchases 
actually give you any advantage,

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,760
which even if you hate the game is 
pretty cool,

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,750
so why do people buy this stuff?
That's only function is cosmetic,

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,460
but we all just idiots trying real hard 
to turn reality into an episode of Black

65
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,911
Mirror.
Well,

66
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:18,744
laugh all you want,
but our fortnights show boaters are 

67
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,230
actually just doing something that we 
all do,

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,273
whether we like to admit it or not.
It's basically just the logic on which 

69
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,503
our whole economy is built to understand
why people want to spend their money on 

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
books just to spend those bucks.
I'm a pick that's shaped like a baseball

71
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:35,874
bat.
We need to hop on a battle bus and 

72
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,470
transport ourselves to the year 18,
99.

73
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,523
Back then most economists were trying to
figure out how the markets worked based 

74
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:46,440
on how useful goods were,
how much labor went into making them,

75
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,960
and of course the supply and demand of 
those items.

76
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,680
Economists essentially believed people 
would rationally ordered their purchases

77
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:53,514
based on need.
You buy bread because it feeds you 

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
coats,
because they keep you warm at second,

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,793
but then they looked at how the wealthy 
were spending their money and thought 

80
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,943
what it turns out.
People were buying the 19th century 

81
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,334
equivalent of bunny brawler or ginger 
gunner skins except probably filthy 

82
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,134
engaged you smallpox or something.
Then along came economist and 

83
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:16,230
sociologist Thorstein veblen tomato 
discovery.

84
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:18,870
That might seem obvious today for 
Veblen.

85
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:19,704
You can explain these irrational 
purchases by recognizing that people 

86
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:23,664
don't just purchase for utility.
They also purchase basically just to be 

87
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,804
cool.
You might call this the snob factor and 

88
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,530
economics,
but he gave it a different name.

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,573
Conspicuous consumption Bebo,
and recognize that people purchased 

90
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:36,414
certain goods and services in order to 
publicly flex their wealth and what did 

91
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:43,080
veblen observed the wealthy doing to 
show us their Mad Moolah?

92
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,090
The ceremonial differentiation of the 
dietary basically really,

93
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,640
really expensive.
Boone's along with servants,

94
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:51,474
huge houses and cars,
all the poor had to get by on bread and 

95
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,134
water.
The ability to consume and even waste 

96
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,310
set the wealthy apart because what says,
I'm special more than literally throwing

97
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:05,880
or drinking away your cash or in a more 
metaphorical sense,

98
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,470
stealing your mom's credit card to spend
hundreds of dollars on viva.

99
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,030
You have spent a bunch of panels on 
playstation.

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,760
I can't believe you have done this.
Okay,

101
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:16,780
you've done this before.

102
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,703
Without this conspicuous consumption,
our modern economies might not even 

103
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,300
exist if the economy just fed us,
clothed us,

104
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,183
housed us,
and gave us medical care and all the 

105
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,484
today,
the economy would grind to a halt for 

106
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:32,170
companies that always need to increase 
their profits.

107
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,720
How do you squeeze a few more dollars 
out of a coat?

108
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,793
Well,
you slap a designer's name on it or you 

109
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:38,344
jack up the price.
To attract those obsessed with status 

110
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,183
fortnight is maybe one of the most 
impressive examples of the digitization 

111
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,130
of conspicuous consumption.
You can set yourself apart.

112
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,890
Irl is you spend hundreds of hours 
playing video games.

113
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,300
Nobody can see your sweet cakes or 
vineyard bind swag and when all eyes are

114
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,040
on you,
once you've made it to the last two,

115
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,663
don't you want to leave an impression,
but for night does more than just 

116
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,080
scratch a digital age for behavior.

117
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,913
We see everywhere around us in fashion 
and cars and houses because it takes 

118
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,560
this idea of conspicuous consumption and
gamifies it.

119
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,803
Mobile Games have the benefit of a 
massive piles of data which allow them 

120
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,260
to optimize your spending night 
employees.

121
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,103
These techniques which are now common on
ecommerce sites and mobile games like 

122
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,390
limited time offers with countdown 
clocks.

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,550
That really reminds you how much you'll 
regret.

124
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,100
Not taking advantage of this deal in the
next 13 hours,

125
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,730
but what sets fortnight apart is its 
babbled pash structure.

126
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,610
Let me explain.
So if you're a regular player,

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,590
each season you can level up up to 100 
times getting the occasional skin glider

128
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,483
tag or now toy,
but it's not every level and as you a 

129
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,380
free player,
get the seat.

130
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,970
Oh Man.
Four levels.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,970
I'll look like the red skull crossed 
with ne more the submariner,

132
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,020
but you'll also see side by side all the
things you're missing,

133
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,900
vbox and XP bonuses and costumes.

134
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,853
You get the idea and at the bottom 
there's a nice little reminder that if 

135
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,430
you spend 10 bucks on the battle pass,
you could unlock all these things you've

136
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,323
already earned,
whereas some games might offer loot 

137
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,564
boxes to manipulate you like a casino 
drawing you in with a dopamine hit from 

138
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:16,700
the luck of the draw fortnight draws you
in with pure conspicuous consumption.

139
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,770
Everyone else with a series of ebooks is
going to have this emote.

140
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,010
Do you really want to be the lead 
without it,

141
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,173
and of course you can earn vbox by 
playing the game and completing 

142
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,354
challenges,
but that'll just take too much time and 

143
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,874
set you apart as the poor kid,
but you might be thinking conspicuous 

144
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,560
consumption is for the rich or at least 
little tay.

145
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,680
I don't even have a park.

146
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,220
People dropping money on fortnite aren't
necessarily loaded well for veblen.

147
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:46,054
Just because conspicuous consumption 
starts with the rich doesn't mean it 

148
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,983
ends there.
If the rich want to show how important 

149
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,804
they are with the things they own,
the poor want to escape the stigma of 

150
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,530
poverty by appearing rich,
and then once the poor have successfully

151
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,364
emulated the rich,
the rich need to buy more equally 

152
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:05,530
useless things to again distinguish 
themselves.

153
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Veblen called this depressing cycle of 
economic epn waving pecuniary emulation.

154
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,170
In this way,
fortnights battle pat system works a lot

155
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:17,710
like fashion magazines.
Anyone can afford to peruse the pages to

156
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:18,544
see what high society is wearing,
even if they can't afford the clothing 

157
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,900
itself,
but that's okay.

158
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,973
In fact,
it's the point you want the audience as 

159
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:30,991
large as possible so that everyone 
regardless of well can spot your $50,000

160
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,823
and this is how fortnight makes money by
playing on our desire to meet at least 

161
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,460
as cool but preferably cooler than 
everyone else.

162
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,563
What better way to earn money than my 
making a game free to everyone so that 

163
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:44,014
nobody feels left out,
but then providing incentive for folks 

164
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,570
to pay to demonstrate their awesomeness.
Like I said,

165
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,750
the game isn't making boucoup bucks 
despite the fact that it's free.

166
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,040
It's making money because it's free and 
does it work?

167
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,113
Let's look at some stats.
In a survey of a thousand fortnight 

168
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,054
players,
68 point eight percent had spent an 

169
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:06,060
average of $85 on the game.
All the bids on cosmetic stuff.

170
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,133
Why?
Because it's all about keeping up with 

171
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,564
the Kardashians,
so it's four nine really doing anything 

172
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,860
we don't already experienced in our 
analog lives,

173
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,770
not really.
They've just found the shiny new digital

174
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,920
arena in which we all want to be liked 
and feel special,

175
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,370
so free or not,
we're totally by now.

176
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:25,440

world of slurp,

juice and boogie bombs,
