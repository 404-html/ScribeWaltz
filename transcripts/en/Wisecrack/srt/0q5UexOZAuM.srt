1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,013
Often had the experience of teaching,
we heard someone calling our name and 

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,460
then realizing that wasn't really the 
case and we just,

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,130
we move on and we forget about it.
Sometimes we notice coincidence like,

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,973
oh,
there were a couple of cars on the 

5
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,150
street,
and again,

6
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,270
we pay no attention to it,
but for someone with schizophrenia,

7
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,510
these experiences take on a vastly 
different.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,600
A kind of a feeling.
So you might notice,

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,493
oh,
there were three red cars on the street 

10
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,590
and instead of just forgetting about it,
you start thinking,

11
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:36,424
well,
why were there three red cars on the 

12
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,250
street?
Maybe has something to do with me?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,233
Maybe these people are actually coming 
to to monitor me or do something that 

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,803
would harm me.
And you start working through some kind 

15
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:48,760
of plot or conspiracy related to that 
coincidence that you noticed

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,000
symptoms that people are most familiar 
with and schizophrenia are often hearing

17
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,480
voices or having paranoid delusions and 
paranoid thoughts.

18
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,240
And we now know that in addition to 
those kinds of symptoms,

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,210
many people with schizophrenia have have
trouble focusing,

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,940
paying attention and remembering things.
Many people you know,

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,540
talk about hearing voices and mean 
different things,

22
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,490
so sometimes people will say,
Oh yeah,

23
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,324
when I'm thinking about what to do,
I hear a voice in my head that tells me 

24
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,090
this would be the right thing to do or 
this would be the wrong thing to do,

25
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:21,924
or or that gives me an idea,
and when individuals with schizophrenia 

26
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,690
talk about hearing voices,
they describe it very,

27
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,840
very differently.
It's really a voice that they can't tell

28
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:35,010
the difference between that voice and a 
voice coming from a person sitting right

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,430
next to them in a room and it sounds 
absolutely real.

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,383
It sounds loud.
Sometimes it's so loud that they can't 

31
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,254
stop paying attention to it and 
sometimes the voices are just calling 

32
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,840
their name,
but sometimes the voices are saying much

33
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,900
more complicated things.
Sometimes they're giving them commands,

34
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:52,734
telling them what to do.
Sometimes they're commenting on what 

35
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,390
they're doing often in a negative or 
derogatory way.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,490
It comes as no surprise that the brain 
is a complicated place.

37
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,443
There's information flying all over the 
brain and the brain has to get that 

38
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:09,704
information to the right place and 
decide what to do with it and we think 

39
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,244
that perhaps in schizophrenia,
some of the problems come because 

40
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,030
information isn't getting to the right 
place or sometimes when information does

41
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:20,864
get to the right place,
the brain doesn't know what it should 

42
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,350
pay attention to and what it should 
ignore.

43
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,600
This is really important in our everyday
lives.

44
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,543
You know,
we might hear a car alarm in the 

45
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,100
background and we have to know not to 
pay attention to that,

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,083
but we might also hear a baby crying in 
the background and that probably is 

47
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,630
something that we need to pay attention 
to.

48
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,703
And so if your brain's not able to act 
as an executive and say this is what's 

49
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:41,954
important and what's not important,
it becomes very difficult to sort 

50
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:46,890
through those everyday situations,
uh,

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,833
in ways that are really important for 
living and holding down a job or 

52
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:51,350
managing your life.

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,320
Seeing things visual hallucinations are 
more uncommon.

54
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,243
Schizophrenia,
they do sometimes happen and sometimes 

55
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
they take the form of people seeing 
ghosts or seeing people who aren't 

56
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,084
really in the room.
Sometimes they look at a picture and 

57
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,924
they see something more than what the 
picture shows a often something with 

58
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,670
nefarious intent.
Uh,

59
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,504
those are the kinds of experiences that 
individuals with schizophrenia will 

60
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,570
sometimes,
uh,

61
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,000
describe some people have them,
some people don't,

62
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,420
even for people who have them,
they can come and go at times,

63
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,423
um,
but these other symptoms that we now 

64
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,820
understand better and are starting to 
recognize more,

65
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,523
they're much more fundamental to the 
disease and they're much harder to deal 

66
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,320
with.
And,

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,860
and those are the symptoms,
like having trouble paying attention,

68
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,903
having trouble remembering information 
and having trouble being able to 

69
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,870
organize your activities and switch from
one activity to another activity.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,793
These are things which individuals with 
schizophrenia start to find are harder 

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,340
than they were before they became ill.
So all of a sudden they,

72
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,270
they have trouble paying attention in 
class.

73
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,580
They have trouble focusing on what 
they're reading.

74
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,200
They have trouble,
you know,

75
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,243
doing jobs that require them to switch 
between one kind of thing and another 

76
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,774
kind of thing quickly and that that 
obviously stands in the way of people 

77
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,180
being able to,
you know,

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,110
live their lives to the fullest,
being able to work,

79
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:11,944
being able to manage their household,
being able to manage their families and 

80
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,540
family relationships.
And so those symptoms,

81
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:20,410
what we often call cognitive symptoms,
symptoms related to attention and memory

82
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,244
and concentration and focus.
They're really one of our biggest 

83
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,420
challenges right now in schizophrenia.
