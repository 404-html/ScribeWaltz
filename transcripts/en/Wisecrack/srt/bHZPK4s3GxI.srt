00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,780
This video is brought to you by 
blackwoods.

2
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:04,820
Stick around till the end of the video 
for a preview.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,500
What's up guys?
Jared here,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,200
as I briefly alluded to in our last 
south park video,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,400
I've been playing a lot of red dead 
redemption two lately and at the risk of

6
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,234
sounding hyperbolic,
it's nothing less than a milestone in 

7
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,230
the art of gaming.
Now,

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,860
I could spend the entirety of this video
geeking out about the detail,

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:30,490
the story of the performances,
but that's not what I want to talk about

10
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:34,120
today because surprise,
I want to talk about philosophy.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,343
In fact,
there's one mission in the game that 

12
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:37,354
builds its entire trajectory around too 
philosophical ideas and not only is it 

13
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:42,604
quite clever,
but it builds off the critique of early 

14
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:49,480
American values that the franchise is so
famous for versus America.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,703
You can always cut a deal.
So welcome to this test Vlog format on 

16
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,904
red dead redemption.
Two we might do a bigger wisecrack 

17
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:59,230
condition that focuses on the entirety 
of the game,

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,730
but I haven't even finished it yet.

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,863
In the meantime,
I know you guys like hearing about our 

20
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:03,754
process,
so consider this a little window into 

21
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,590
how we think about things.
Let us know what you think about it.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,770
This new format in the comments and very
insignificant spoilers ahead.

23
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,170
Seriously,
it just doesn't matter.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,403
Starting early in chapter four,
you can go on a three part stranger 

25
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:20,080
mission called idealism and pragmatism 
for beginners.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,033
So yeah,
you can probably see why we're breaking 

27
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,134
down this mission.
It comically explores the basic tenants 

28
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,404
of idealism and pragmatism,
but it's in its exploration of 

29
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:29,884
pragmatism,
a uniquely American philosophy that we 

30
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,214
get to see that classic rock star 
sarcasm as they take American values 

31
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,743
down a peg.
And the first part of the mission we're 

32
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,264
introduced to mayor Lemieux,
the pragmatist and his assistant John 

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,893
mark the idealist.
The Mayor Informs Arthur that he 

34
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:49,720
recently bought a collection of classic 
paintings to hang in a new museum.

35
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:53,230
He plans to open,
but turns out he's been conned.

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,050
The sleazy art dealer painted them 
himself,

37
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,830
but that's no biggie for Limu.
The problem solver who will display them

38
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,290
anyway,
these are good paintings.

39
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,810
I can't make the difference.
And I'm French,

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,703
but an expert by the name of professor 
shift occur is on his way to evaluate 

41
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,650
the paintings and make public their 
fraudulence.

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,970
So Mayor Lemieux Hires Arthur to 
intimidate professor shift occur so that

43
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:16,804
he changes his professional opinion and 
deems the paintings real shift occur 

44
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,090
initially.
Resist.

45
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,330
Bud Arthur's fist are quite convincing.

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,880
Okay.
So what does this have to do with either

47
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,260
philosophy?
Well,

48
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,123
in this part of the mission,
we most clearly see an interesting 

49
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:36,094
exploration of pragmatism originating in
the 1870s pregnant tism isn't American 

50
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:43,390
philosophy primarily developed by 
Charles Pierce?

51
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:47,860
William James and John Dewey pragmatists
vary in their specific philosophies,

52
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:48,694
but one tendency among them all is their
willingness to settle metaphysical and 

53
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:56,590
scientific debates according to the 
practical consequences of ideas.

54
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,420
So basically they emphasize that which 
useful to advance human understanding of

55
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,680
the world.
More importantly,

56
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,514
this stands in contrast with those who 
sought out universal truths with reason 

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,760
allowed German idealists like a manual 
con.

58
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,350
So on the one level we see the mayor 
ever the pragmatist deciding to beat the

59
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,870
shit out of a man.
So long as it's useful.

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,520
And John Mark the idealist holding moral
principles as universal truths,

61
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,120
not unlike our boy caught fire nuts is 
never right.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,193
But there's another reading of this 
scenario that perhaps incidentally 

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,190
comments on how pragmatism deals with 
our understanding of reality.

64
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,530
Pragmatists don't look towards universal
truths and stress that human ideas about

65
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:42,430
reality are likely wrong.
So because humans are fallible,

66
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,323
some pragmatic thinkers favor ideas that
are the most useful for a pragmatist 

67
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,154
like John Dewey.
Scientific hypotheses are great because 

68
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,710
they're useful.
And even if they're not 100% right,

69
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,220
we can fumble around with them to 
acquire more scientific knowledge,

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,770
which allows us to concoct better 
theories.

71
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,310
The same for dewey should be true of 
philosophical ideas.

72
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,220
Rather than search for some capital t 
truth,

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,113
one should instead search for an idea 
that may be useful to humanity and its 

74
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,954
advancement of knowledge.
So here we see another layer to the 

75
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,434
joke.
The mayor hires Arthur to beat the shit 

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,300
out of a guy until he admits that a fake
painting is real.

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,523
Now,
although this isn't exactly what the 

78
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,540
pragmatist we're talking about,
they're making a blunt if reductive joke

79
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,250
about pragmatism.
Sure.

80
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,084
The paintings aren't real per se,
but the idea that they are real has its 

81
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,840
use in the advancement of public 
education and culture.

82
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,060
So who cares if they're fraudulent

83
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,983
vapor?
Going to look at those pains and love 

84
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,850
them.
So you're helping me

85
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,140
as William James said in his work,
pragmatism,

86
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,150
a new name for some old ways of 
thinking.

87
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,223
The true is the name for whatever proves
itself to be good in the way of belief 

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,070
and good too for definite assignable 
reasons.

89
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,280
This idea of partial truths also comes 
up later.

90
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,580
I'm worried that he's going to open his 
mouth and say things that aren't true to

91
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:05,581
those vulgar puritans at the newspaper.
Well perhaps true,

92
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,600
but not the whole truth.

93
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,900
Now I don't think anyone at rock star is
reading John Dewey and if you are,

94
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,320
please send me an email.
But this take on pragmatism as it's more

95
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:19,700
commonly understood by non philosophers 
is in line with red dead cynical take on

96
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,670
the value systems that propelled the 
west at the turn of the century.

97
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,730
Pragmatism is darkly cast as an ideology
that more or less justifies selfish,

98
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:28,940
cynical behavior.

99
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Education is the most wonderful thing.
It'll raise us higher and higher.

100
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Make civics and ethics lesser work of a 
dirty minded pragmatists like me and the

101
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:46,460
calling of higher,
better men here,

102
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,294
hey,

103
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,173
in part two of the mission,
we see this distinction between the 

104
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,740
dirty pragmatism of the mayor and John 
Marks.

105
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:53,574
Idealism.
When the mayor hires you to once again 

106
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,880
intimidate a man into funding the 
library,

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,160
Arthur does what he does best and the 
newspaper man gives in and libraries are

108
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,300
good things,
right?

109
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,280
Look at these beautiful books.
This is magnificent.

110
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,310
We'll bring this city back to life.
If it kills me,

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,333
I didn't probably shower,
so if it requires a little bit of nasty 

112
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,490
business to get something done,
it's worth it,

113
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,850
right?
Such pragmatic justifications for pretty

114
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,684
gnarly shit are all over both games,
including the essential conflict of the 

115
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,350
first game,
threatened John's family in order to get

116
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:31,184
him to do what they want,
killed the remaining members of the 

117
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,034
gang.
In the third and final part of the 

118
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,164
mission,
we see a final standoff between these 

119
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,870
two ideas systems.

120
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,883
When John Mark Turns on the mayor for 
his seeming lack of principals will 

121
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,384
strive to improve the city's moral 
backbone by any means available to us 

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,690
who we are then reasoning.
Yes.

123
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,130
Yes,
yes.

124
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,870
Within my reason because it's better to 
get something done than nothing at all.

125
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,060
Like you said,
Tony,

126
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,053
uh,
Tony corrupted lemieux how I long for 

127
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:04,130
the luxury to have principles such as 
you,

128
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,580
but I must actually do things.
So there you have it.

129
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,473
A little taste of philosophy in what is 
undoubtedly a top contender for game of 

130
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,670
the year.
So what do you guys think?

131
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,683
Is this exploration of pragmatism 
relevant in more areas than just this 

132
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,734
one mission?
What does know what you think and hope 

133
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,270
you guys enjoyed this new blog format.
And as I already mentioned,

134
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm super impressed with the story of 
red dead too.

135
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,654
So if you guys were looking for more 
engaging stories to listen to all your 

136
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,524
hunting,
legendary animals are trying to find 

137
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,390
those rare herbs.
You gotta check out blackwood.

138
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,413
It's a narrative podcast about our group
of friends investigating their small 

139
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:38,810
towns,
urban legend,

140
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:39,644
the Blackwood bug man.
It's kind of like vhs or Blair witch 

141
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,320
project meets stranger things with it's 
found footage,

142

audio style.
Each episode leaves you wanting more,

148
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,763
Five years ago,
three teenagers from the small town of 

149
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,214
Blackwood,
