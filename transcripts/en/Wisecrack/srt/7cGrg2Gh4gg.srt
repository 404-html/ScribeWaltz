1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,380
Hey wise crack.
Jared here.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,020
Today we're breaking down everyone's 
favorite insomniac,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,510
his soap salesman bff,
and they're super,

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,260
super secret underground club for due to
like to beat each other senseless.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,273
That's right.
We're talking about that thing you're 

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,224
not supposed to talk about.
For most fight club is about chiseled 

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,374
men who like to knock each other's teeth
out and destroy private property to 

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,124
escape the monotony of consumer culture.
But there's something about fight club 

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:30,240
we often overlook is tyler durden really
the suave savior.

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,960
We thought he was welcome to this 
wisecrack condition on the philosophy of

11
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:35,520
fight club.
And as always,

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,503
spoilers ahead.
Fight club begins with our nameless 

13
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:42,300
protagonist slash narrator as he tries 
to beat insomnia and complete his life.

14
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,890
One Ikea Shelf at a time.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,203
Yes.
Like to order the Eric Carle dust 

16
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:47,910
ruffles

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,750
is doctor suggests he see real pain at a
testicular cancer support group.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,800
And our narrator finally finds the key 
to sleep crying his eyes out.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,620
But another faker,
Marla singer ruins it,

20
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:02,190
flaunting her lack of balls to are now 
again sleepless narrator.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,360
Testicular cancer should be no contest,
I think.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,413
Well,
I have one more right to me though than 

23
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,470
you.
You still have your balls off,

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,400
gets put on hold.
When the narrator's apartment blows up,

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,353
destroying his perfectly manicured 
lifestyle and forcing him to live with 

26
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,910
one tyler durden,
he and tyler share some drinks.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,870
Go on wild in Xeni Adventures and 
convince lots of people to beat the crap

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,090
out of each other.
Also domestic terrorism,

29
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:24,924
but we'll get to that.
The most overt theme in Fight Club is 

30
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,104
the drudgery of consumer capitalism.
Our narrator lives a tiny life of 

31
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:32,574
tedium,
working a job he hates throughout the 

32
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,360
film.
He looks half asleep staring,

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,160
absent,
mindedly into space,

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,580
unable to feel anything.
At one point the narrator tells us

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,513
when you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep and you're 

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,720
never really awake

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,673
as he watches an infomercial suggesting 
that he's not only half conscious 

38
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,410
because of insomnia,
but also consumerism,

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,393
but more importantly by club shows a 
world of what sociologists call 

40
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,173
rationalization.
Rationalization in this sense isn't 

41
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,250
quite using rationality in the way you 
might think,

42
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,030
but using a certain kind of rationality 
to organize society.

43
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,870
Essentially rationalization favors 
efficiency over tradition,

44
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,840
custom or individual desires.
So for example,

45
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:14,674
instead of getting your pies made with 
love from the nice little bigger down 

46
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,094
the street,
you get them from a factory where 

47
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:22,000
they're made on a cold dead assembly 
line.

48
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,900
Modern social life is pretty much 
dominated by rationalization.

49
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,883
It's organized to accommodate large 
numbers of people in the most efficient 

50
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,424
way possible.
Everything in the narrator's life is 

51
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,154
designed for a specific purpose.
Mass produced and unrelentingly 

52
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:38,400
predictable down to his bosses tie.

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,030
It must've been Tuesday he was wearing 
this cornflower blue tie,

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,380
even calls his own home,

55
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,253
a condo on the 15th floor of a filing 
cabinet for widows and young 

56
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,400
professionals describing

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,233
his existence as nothing more than an 
efficient way to store and organize 

58
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:53,344
things.
Fight Club shows us that efficiency has 

59
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,134
its downsides,
especially in a world where efficient 

60
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,320
means efficiently consuming to the point
where as Tyler durden says,

61
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,560
things you own end up owning you.

62
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,910
The narrator describes everything as 
being a

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,520
copy of a copy of a copy.

64
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,490
Consumer products and consumers are 
indistinguishable from each other.

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,770
The drive this point home director David
Fincher,

66
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:20,210
even put a starbucks cup in almost every
scene of the film for philosophers,

67
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:21,044
Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer.
This trend of indistinguishable 

68
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:27,860
commodities is a direct result of 
rationalization according to them.

69
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,723
Everything we're sold comes from a 
standardized menu of constructs all 

70
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:32,744
designed to be as cost effective as 
possible while promoting fake 

71
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,120
differences.
Consider the Dubé,

72
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,890
which may or may not be different than a
comforter.

73
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,240
I don't know.
I tried to read about it.

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,790
Gava

75
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,790
no want a DJ is blank.
Just blank.

76
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,290
Why don't guys like you and I know what 
the phase this essential to our survival

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,090
in the hunter gatherer sense of the 
word.

78
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,930
No.
What are we going to consumers,

79
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,820
right?

80
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,653
Some good marketing might make the 
things we buy seem different from each 

81
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:06,164
other,
but in reality they're all pretty much 

82
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,220
the same.
Hobbies of copies of copies.

83
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,203
This commodification of all things makes
life pretty dull and also kind of 

84
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:18,530
fascist for Adorno and Horkheimer and 
for the characters in fight club,

85
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,220
living in a rationalized world can have 
a dehumanizing effect.

86
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,143
Turning everyone into lonely,
alienated drones at the behest of 

87
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:27,740
consumer capitalism,
living life,

88
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:28,574
just following orders if you will,
flown around the country on business 

89
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:31,814
trips.
The narrator describes the isolation 

90
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:35,270
that comes with a single serving 
lifestyle.

91
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,020
Everything is small and disposable.
Even the people he meets,

92
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,863
it's the people I meet on each flight.
They're single serving friends between 

93
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:47,070
takeoff and landing.
We have our time together.

94
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,210
That's all we get.

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,733
After getting in a car accident.
He muses about the dehumanizing effect 

96
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,250
of his own work.

97
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,263
I'd never been in a car accident.
This must've been when all those people 

98
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:02,000
felt like before I filed them statistics
in my reports.

99
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,060
So how do we cope with a single serving 
lifestyle?

100
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,160
One might be tempted to say,
get a hobby,

101
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:10,220
bro,
but for Adorno and Horkheimer amusement,

102
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,083
under modern day,
capitalism has just become a 

103
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:13,514
prolongation of work.
Hobbies and entertainment serve to 

104
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,890
rejuvenate us so we can go back to work 
the next day.

105
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,570
But those same things that keep us sane 
in our off hours are still determined by

106
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:26,750
the system.
This makes amusement the after images of

107
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:29,150
the work process itself.
In other words,

108
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,940
if we are working,
we're buying mass produced stuff to help

109
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,340
us feel better about the fact that we 
have to go to work again.

110
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,120
The next day.

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,953
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder 
what kind of dining set defines me as a 

112
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,060
person

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,893
or we get the fat sucked out of us,
which was caused by our own decadent 

114
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,470
lifestyle.

115
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,310
You were selling rich women,
their own fat asses back to them.

116
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,263
The narrator's way of coping is still 
just an extension of living as a 

117
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:52,530
consumer in a rationalized world.

118
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,420
I had it all.
I had that's there.

119
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,250
That was a very decent wardrobe.
That was very respectable.

120
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,400
I was close to being complete

121
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,323
during the winter as far as directly 
comparing this kind of mass consumption 

122
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,293
to fascism for him,
the mechanism of rationalization that 

123
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:13,230
causes people to blindly throw their 
money at big companies like starbucks is

124
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:17,520
the same mechanism that causes people to
throw themselves at Fascist ideology.

125
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,503
Much like the citizens of a fascist 
state mobilize under a totalitarian 

126
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,134
dictator.
Modern society has mobilized under 

127
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,804
capitalism.
It isn't until his apartment 

128
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:27,114
mysteriously blows up that the narrator 
finds a new way to resist 

129
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:33,450
rationalization after losing all his 
precious Ikea furniture.

130
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,690
He trades in elite and capitalism for a 
place in tyler.

131
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,524
Durden is crumbling mansion on paper 
street paper streets is the exact 

132
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,650
opposite of his former apartment,
while the other one was small,

133
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:47,160
efficient and well decorated.
Paper Street is needlessly large,

134
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:50,730
disorganized and dirty.
If his apartment was rational,

135
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,580
paper street is irrational.
In his new home,

136
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:57,000
he joins tyler durden and his fight 
against consumer culture.

137
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,290
Tyler,
the charming,

138
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,124
charismatic leader of Fight Club 
champions a resistance against 

139
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,484
oppressive consumerism,
offering the narrator and escape in a 

140
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:05,694
way to reclaim his identity.
But what does escaping rationalization 

141
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,040
have to do with punching people in the 
face?

142
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,933
Tyler's resistance takes things a bit 
further than your run of the mill 

143
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:14,934
critique of capitalism.
He frames consumerism as an assault on 

144
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:18,564
masculinity.
The men in fight club basically fear 

145
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:24,780
that society is turning them into women.
They feel degraded by their jobs.

146
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,690
The narrator,
in this sense is the perfect image of an

147
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:28,524
emasculated consumer.
He's weak and goes to support groups 

148
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,270
where he hugs people and cries,
you know,

149
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,990
girl stuff at the testicular cancer 
support groups.

150
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:38,280
Some of them have literally become 
emasculated.

151
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,233
One of the participants laments,
he's been cuckolded as his wife has had 

152
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:43,740
the child they could never have had with
a new man.

153
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,800
She had her first child last week,
a girl with her new husband.

154
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,780
The film really drives this symbolism 
home with the character of Bob.

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,793
Once a bodybuilder,
bob literally loses his balls to 

156
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,580
testicular cancer and gross bitch tits 
as a result of hormone therapy.

157
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,240
There's still men.
Yes.

158
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:08,390
Where I'm at man is what we are.

159
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,020
His loss of masculinity results in a 
stranger from his family.

160
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,390
Any fields completely dehumanized?

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,640
No.
I'm Baker up,

162
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,680
divorced my two grandkids.
What do you mean return?

163
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,124
My phone calls.

164
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,193
The narrator and Tyler also discussed 
their absentee fathers wondering what 

165
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:32,110
the role of being raised by women has 
played in their lives.

166
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,190
We're a generation of men raised by 
women.

167
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,910
I'm wondering if another woman is really
the answer.

168
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:38,580
We name

169
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,050
and Tyler tells the narrator,

170
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,390
Oh man,
it couldn't be worse.

171
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,820
Woman could cut off your penis,
wave sleeping,

172
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,800
toss out the window of a moving car.

173
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,753
Seriously,
this whole movie is about losing your 

174
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,794
balls and or Dick.
Given the emasculation of modern 

175
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:51,824
consumer society,
Fight Club is appealing because it 

176
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,434
allows members to express themselves by 
acting in a way they can't in everyday 

177
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,790
life being really,
really violent,

178
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,090
which is something they associate with 
being men with a capital m.

179
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,193
Masculinity through aggression provides 
a way for the men to cope with their 

180
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:09,450
girly day jobs and domestic consumer 
behavior.

181
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,403
But while Tyler durden laments the fake 
kind of masculinity sold to us by 

182
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,650
Hollywood,
he sells them another kind of manliness.

183
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,520
The second half of fight club is all 
about how tyler durden has taken all the

184
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,354
things.
Project mayhem is supposed to rebel 

185
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:23,544
against,
repackaged it and sold it to his 

186
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,730
project.
Mayhem stooges,

187
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,300
the members of fight club just become 
copies of copies of each other.

188
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,380
They shaved their heads,
called each other magnet.

189
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,960
They even lose their names in project 
mayhem.

190
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,420
We have no names rebelling against the 
system that's made them faceless drones.

191
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,990
They become well,
faceless drones and rumor,

192
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,090
all that stuff about losing your balls.
Well,

193
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:48,480
testicles under the reign of tyler 
aren't fairing much better either.

194
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,523
The movie gives us an early glimpse of 
what's to come as tyler durden just 

195
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,420
repeatedly punches this guy in the Dick 
Project.

196
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,550
Mayhem later threatens to cuts 
everyone's balls off

197
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,473
publicly state that there isn't a 
wunderground or these guys are going to 

198
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,090
take your balls.

199
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,183
Even its own founder.
You said if anyone ever interferes with 

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,673
project mayhem even you,
we got to get his balls for Bob and the 

201
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:12,574
narrator fight club has simply replace 
the support groups in their lives and 

202
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,594
they chat about their fight club.
Days like one might talk about their 

203
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,410
weekly support groups.
Schedules

204
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,730
go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I go Saturday,

205
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,970
tyler acts like a strong father figure 
for the narrator and the rest of Project

206
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,803
Bay Ham.
I will carry you kicking and screaming 

207
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:34,210
and in the end you will think of me but 
like the narrator's he father,

208
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,113
he left when I was like six years old.
I had this other woman had kids and he 

209
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,103
like did this every six years.
He goes to a new city and starts a new 

210
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:43,304
family

211
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,140
franchise.
Pilar abandoned him.

212
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,880
The most devoted members of fight club 
are put through intense hazing to become

213
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:53,280
members of project mayhem before they 
can join.

214
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,233
Perspective members have to stand 
outside the paper street mansion for 

215
00:10:56,371 --> 00:11:00,210
three days without food or shelter and 
her verbally and physically abused.

216
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,253
Those who tough it out are allowed 
inside the house and Become Part of a 

217
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,224
well oiled machine that blows up 
computer stores to horizons politicians 

218
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,930
and since corporate sculptures rolling 
into coffee shops.

219
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:10,883
As Tyler's movement gains momentum,
it transforms from an afterschool 

220
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:14,394
activity into a fascist cult that might 
just be as bad as the capitalism they 

221
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,770
rebelled against in the first place.

222
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,730
You are not,
we're not beautiful,

223
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,230
no place for the same decaying organic 
matter and everything else.

224
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,890
Time was built himself in army.

225
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,530
We are the all singing,
all dancing wrap up the world.

226
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,310
We are all hard to say pop magic

227
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,850
mayhem operates through strict rules and
systematic efficiency.

228
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,953
Even rely on capital to run properly and
fund their activities by making and 

229
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:52,070
selling soap out of human fat stolen 
from a liposuction clinic.

230
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,083
The difference is now instead of 
reporting to the demands of their 

231
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:55,954
corporate bosses,
members report to their patriarchal 

232
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:59,900
authoritarian leader,
tyler durden.

233
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,090
Sooner or later we all became what tyler
wanted us to be.

234
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,920
Chapters began springing up all over the
United States.

235
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,370
The narrator even calls them franchises.

236
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,450
Tyler had been busy setting up 
franchises all over the country

237
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,523
the entire time.
Project mayhem has been plotting toward 

238
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,074
a master plan,
blowing up the officers of the credit 

239
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:19,984
card companies.
The narrator discovers this plan and 

240
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,510
also discovers that he and tyler durden 
are the same person.

241
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,030
Is that a pretty accurate description?
I've got relationship tyler.

242
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,670
We have just lost cabin pressure.

243
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,700
Tyler durden was the manly virile 
compliment to the narrator's emasculated

244
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:35,534
helplessness,
and if we recall when the narrator says 

245
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,540
early on that

246
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,030
and suddenly I realized that all of 
this,

247
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,470
the gun,
the bombs,

248
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,820
the revolution that's got something to 
do with a girl named Marla sings

249
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,880
probably means that his spiral into 
psychosis began when he needed to create

250
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,530
an alter ego to be with her.

251
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,570
You were looking for a way to change 
your life.

252
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,980
Could not do this on your own,
all the ways you wish you could be.

253
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,930
That's me.
Look like you want to look like you want

254
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,160
to look.
I'm smart,

255
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,690
capable,
and most importantly,

256
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,060
I'm free and all the ways that you are 
not,

257
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,920
he's able to get rid of durden by 
shooting himself in the face,

258
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:12,754
but the damage is already done.
The buildings collapsed supposedly to 

259
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:16,894
reset societies debt,
although I'm not sure how that actually 

260
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,700
works.
Just like tyler and the narrator are two

261
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,490
sides of the same person for Adorno and 
Horkheimer.

262
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,970
Fascism and capitalism are two sides of 
the same coin.

263
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,043
They argued that both fascism and 
capitalism see human beings as numbers 

264
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:33,454
instead of individuals.
Alienated objects to be used and 

265
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,200
control.
So what do you guys think?

266
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,243
What's worse?
So coming to the lower of Ikea catalogs 

267
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,064
and coffee chains,
or following the orders of a fascist 

268
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:46,150
soap salesman offering promises of 
humanity.

269
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,580
