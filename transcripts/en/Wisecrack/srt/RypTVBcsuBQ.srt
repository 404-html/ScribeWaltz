00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,230
What's up guys?
Jared here.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,290
This isn't the first time we've talked 
about this season of south park,

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,790
but for lack of a better phrase,
just to briefly recap,

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,624
the season so far,
south park has been exploring the 

7
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:23,470
feeling of hopelessness in the modern 
world,

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,360
whether it's school shootings,
Predator,

9
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,610
priests,
outrage mobs or east suitors.

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,444
Nobody asks for South Park has been 
showing us and exhausted population 

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,090
resigned to the fact that nothing can be
fixed.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,200
It seems like South Park is once again 
evaluating their legacy in the world.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,650
Last season's southmark reflected on 
their impact on the culture.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,320
Most obviously scene in the episode 
super hard.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,300
Penis in which kyle be standing for the 
show itself condemns the harmful effects

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,570
of terrorists and fill up another 
standard.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,493
The show,

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,633
although the previous season never made 
a definitive statement whether or not 

19
00:00:58,861 --> 00:00:59,694
south park is harmful.
Something interesting has happened in 

20
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,400
the last few episodes with the recent 
reintroduction of man bear pig,

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,510
Matt stone and Trey Parker seem to be 
taking their efforts at self evaluation.

22
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,490
A step further,
in fact,

23
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:14,460
their new message seems to be more akin 
to a full fledged.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,713
We're sorry.
So welcome to this wisecrack quick take 

25
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:21,180
on South Park season 22 episodes six and
seven,

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,350
and of course spoilers ahead.
Now,

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,290
for those of you who haven't seen season
tends episode man bear pig or just don't

28
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,124
remember stuff from over a decade ago.
It features our Gore warning south 

29
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,690
hearts,
children of the half man,

30
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,220
half bear,
half pigments,

31
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,990
dressing.
I'm spreading man.

32
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:37,824
Bear pig awareness.
Hear each of your kids take a pamphlet 

33
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,214
and a bumper sticker.
Mr Gordon takes them on a farcical 

34
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,844
hunting to a cave where the children 
almost died even as he believed that 

35
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:48,504
children have died.
Al Gore gets super stoked about his 

36
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,444
alleged defeat of man bear pig and how 
people will in turn be super stoked on 

37
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,124
him.

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,893
I killed.
I've saved the earth from certain 

39
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:03,490
destruction.
Everyone is

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,320
for stoked on me.
Man.

41
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:09,010
Bear pig at that time and now was a 
super cereal.

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,560
Not so subtle.
Stand in for climate change.

43
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,100
Gore had released his film an 
inconvenient truth that same year,

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,590
and while one might view the joke of man
bear pig,

45
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:20,590
to be mostly about Al Gore's attention 
seeking behavior,

46
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,603
you just use pig as a way to get 
attention for yourself because you're a 

47
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,080
loser.

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,913
There are plenty of hints in the South 
Park Cannon that Matt and Trey didn't 

49
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:32,160
take climate change too seriously.
In the season five episode,

50
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:34,710
terrence and fill up behind the blow.
We get this.

51
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,630
Uh,
excuse me.

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,613
My daddy is a geologist and he says,
there actually isn't any concrete 

53
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,600
evidence of global warming.
That's not true.

54
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,583
Global warming is going to kill us.
All the Republicans are responsible and 

55
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,070
in the season nine episode,
two days before the day after tomorrow,

56
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,860
people wrongly accused a flood on global
warming.

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,843
Oh Jesus.

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,260
When in reality stand just crashed the 
boat into a beaver dam.

59
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,450
Shout out to our Fan Malcolm for 
pointing this out,

60
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,463
man.
Bear pig also escapes from imagination 

61
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,560
land.
The implication being,

62
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,110
you know,
climate change is imaginary.

63
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,063
Now man,
bear pig is back and it seems like Matt 

64
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:19,910
and Trey have changed their tune on the 
issue.

65
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,750
Do what you remember,
dude warned about this,

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,250
that Weirdo guy who came and told us 
what happened,

67
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,763
he was right in man,
bear pig is real and the show is now 

68
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,834
going out of its way to not only 
associate man bear pig with Gore's past 

69
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:34,891
warnings.
Oh,

70
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,660
is it inconvenient?
Now,

71
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,830
I tried to warn you all,
but no one took me theorial,

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,020
but to admit that they were wrong to 
trivialized his claims.

73
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,973
In fact,
when it comes to making fun of climate 

74
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:45,954
change blowhards,
it seems like they have a different 

75
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,474
target now.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,640
There's no scientific proof,
no real evidence of a man bear pig.

77
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,800
Why are you trying to figure out what's 
going on with scientists?

78
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,763
Matt and Trey also take aim at people 
who waffle around about whether or not 

79
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,810
they should worry about man bear pig to 
begin with.

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,070
It looks like Satan is here.
Should I start to worry,

81
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,600
which is a stark departure from this.
Even if global warming war real,

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,970
which all proven scientific data shows 
it is,

83
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:19,470
and it would take millions of years for 
our climate shift to happen and as smoke

84
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:23,130
fills the landscape of south park,
it seems like they may even be referring

85
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:23,964
to the recent wildfires in California.
Their apology decor is made most 

86
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,950
explicit in episode seven.

87
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,160
What more do you want from me?
I've atoned for my mistake.

88
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,070
I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of 
gifting information at the time.

89
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,680
You know even you were wrong about a lot
of the things you said would happen.

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,620
That's not to say they're letting up on 
the almost 43rd president of the US.

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,910
He's still painted as a narcissistic 
Douche who cares more about the image of

92
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,744
himself as a heroic climate advocate 
than actually dealing with climate 

93
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,140
change.
So now that the show recognizes the real

94
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,300
threat of climate change,
what is to be done?

95
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,523
Well,
if you're an adult in the town of South 

96
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,240
Park,
the answer is Jack Enter the game that I

97
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:04,090
wish I was at home playing right now.
Red Dead Redemption.

98
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:04,924
Two,
all the adults from sergeant gates to 

99
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,670
randy to the cops to even Satan analysis
score.

100
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,640
You're playing red dead redemption.
Two so good,

101
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,474
right are playing and for the most part,
they're too busy escaping to their new 

102
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:17,664
hyper detailed,
wild west second life to deal with 

103
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:22,140
something as depressingly hopeless as 
man bear pig,

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,230
not unlike the reaction to Sharon and 
episode one.

105
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,333
Sheldon were shocked they were killed at
a school where they were supposed to be 

106
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:30,804
safe.

107
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,363
What else is going on?
The adults of South Park are more keen 

108
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,980
on dismissing problems than addressing 
them.

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,080
Maybe he's going to kill everyone and 
he's gonna.

110
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,850
Stop.

111
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,670
Well then I guess I don't have to do 
anything about it,

112
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,533
but more importantly,
this man bear pig business makes some 

113
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:50,060
pretty clever parallels to the idea of a
faustian bargain.

114
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,793
Bargain comes from the German tale of 
faust who through a contract inked and 

115
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:55,784
blood sold his soul to the devil,
exchange for knowledge or worldly 

116
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,840
pleasures and isn't a convenient that I 
will miss.

117
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,693
Character comes back for this episode.
Belsky and bargains are everywhere in 

118
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,854
literature and film,
sometimes with the devil and sometimes 

119
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:09,884
not,
but the basic premise is that one 

120
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:15,140
achieved some goal in exchange for some 
kind of horrifying fate,

121
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,183
like an eternity in hell.
We soon find out that man bear pig is a 

122
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,670
fate sifting demon who made a faustian 
bargain with grandpa marsh.

123
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,803
He's sacrificed the future for some 
sweet cars and even sweeter ice cream 

124
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,663
here on the show is making a clever not 
to the argument that the economic 

125
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:34,160
prosperity of one generation has left 
the current one.

126
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
As Stan says,
we're stupid.

127
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:37,554
Band applied.
A bunch of other old people made the 

128
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:39,200
deal with Mandera.
Peggy.

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,073
It's here because of their greediness 
screening and the most tragic thing 

130
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,504
about it and why we think this fits with
our previous thesis of this being the 

131
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:52,190
season of resignation is that Grandpa is
right in the end.

132
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,083
Man Bear pig offers to leave south park.
If they agreed to give up red dead 

133
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,990
redemption and soy sauce,

134
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,260
he said they'll never come back again,
but we have to give up soy sauce and red

135
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,110
dead redemption.
Two.

136
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,510
Okay,

137
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,770
why soy sauce?
Well,

138
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,604
it's probably an illusion to the fact 
that soy farming to supply both humans 

139
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,264
and livestock has cut down a whole lot 
of rain forest in the Amazon and the 

140
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:12,821
south.
Partake.

141
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:15,440
Take Mandera pick up on this offer.
Just the ride.

142
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,840
Nope.
And for everyone who wants to blame baby

143
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,080
boomers on destroying the planet,
the kids are just as greed.

144
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,890
Could we possibly talk about 
restructuring a new deal?

145
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,550
Uh Huh.
Nah.

146
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:25,790
The

147
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,310
episode ends with another foul skin 
bargain.

148
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,173
This time,
literally a contract that shifts the 

149
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,814
chaos of man bear pig on to the future.
There's actually an economic takeaway 

150
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,540
here.
The idea of an extra banality,

151
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,493
as you probably know,
the basic building blocks of an economy 

152
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,373
are a lot of smaller exchanges.
I give you some wood for your sheep and 

153
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,530
we've completed a transaction that has 
made both parties happy.

154
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,500
People agree to exchange different goods
and services.

155
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,980
And as a result,
the world exists well as it does,

156
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,963
but an externality complicates our 
understanding of two private citizens 

157
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,954
making a private deal.
That's because some exchanges have a 

158
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:06,950
spillover effect or some kind of 
external consequences to the trade.

159
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,300
So if I pay Alec $5 to let woody on his 
neighbors smelling my dog's gnarly poops

160
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,053
is an externality of that transaction.
One they never asked for enter South 

161
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,280
Park.

162
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,113
This faustian bargain with man.
Bear pig is a literalization of how 

163
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,104
externalities work.
The town gets to keep soy sauce and red 

164
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,374
dead,
but someone down the line has to deal 

165
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,250
with the external consequences of that 
transaction.

166
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,000
Namely man bear pig slaughtering 
everybody when he comes back,

167
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,343
but more literally,
it's about how private consumption of 

168
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,590
cars,
gas,

169
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,010
ice cream,
red dead and soy sauce impact people who

170
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,290
were never involved in that exchange to 
begin with.

171
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,700
Now,
in real life,

172
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,450
cars produced carbon dioxide that enters
the entire world's atmosphere.

173
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,553
Ice Cream uses milk from dairy cows who 
are fighting their way towards 

174
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:56,820
humanities demise and red dead.
Well,

175
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,654
there's probably an argument to be made 
about heavy metals and your playstation 

176
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,434
or something.
South Park locates these externalities 

177
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,583
geographically and sign here that man 
bear pig has rights to the lives of all 

178
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,410
children in third world countries,
which points to how poor people,

179
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,303
especially in developing countries are 
way less able to cope with rampant 

180
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,960
forest fires,
food shortages,

181
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,794
and rising sea levels and temporarily as
much of the externalities related to 

182
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,970
climate change will go on to be some 
other generation's problem

183
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,920
and you didn't get to what it would mean
for your grandchildren.

184
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,660
I didn't think I'd have grandkids.
I didn't even want children.

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,650
That's why I always came on.
Graham.

186
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,440
Graham's

187
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,273
so has southpark matured this season by 
apologizing for their dismissal of what 

188
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:42,210
now seems to be a very real issue.
Sure,

189
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,250
they may have recognized that they were 
wrong,

190
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,220
but they still leave us with a classics 
health part.

191
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,760
Conclusion.
Mankind sucks and there's nothing we can

192
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,440
do about it.
Hooray.

193
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,113
