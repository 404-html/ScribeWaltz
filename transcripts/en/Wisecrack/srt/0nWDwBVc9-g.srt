1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,903
I think

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,930
the war on terror construct won't seem 
that important.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,750
Um,
and I,

4
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,160
I,
uh,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,400
when nine slash 11 happened,
we all believed including me,

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:28,401
that it would be a,
first of all that it was a typical event

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,840
like Pearl Harbor,
which now,

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,690
you know,
doesn't seem to be the case.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,003
Uh,
and second of all that there would be 

10
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:40,390
many more nine slash 11 or several more,
nine slash 11 and there haven't been.

11
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:43,170
And I hope there aren't basically,
um,

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,610
it,
it may be a with hindsight,

13
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,980
which is always unfair that people will 
say,

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,050
even though it was by far the worst 
terrorist attack in American history,

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,583
you have to explain to your 
grandchildren why there was such an 

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,150
extreme reaction to one terrorist attack
and why that,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,433
you know,
seem to quote unquote change everything 

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,570
about American life and America's role 
in the world.

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,100
I suspect that that's what we'll think a
generation from now.

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,560
And then the other thing I think is,
um,

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,470
uh,
I,

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,900
I suspect that this may be more of a 
hope,

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,510
but I,
I think I'm right that,

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,823
you know,
when we're sitting around with her 

25
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,034
grandchildren,
the level of mistrust or the public 

26
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:35,970
sector will seem nutty in how high it 
was during this era.
