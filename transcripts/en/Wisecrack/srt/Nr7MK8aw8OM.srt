The first thousand people to sign up 

2
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:04,064
with the link in the description.
We'll get their first two months for 

3
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:07,070
just 99 cents.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,093
Yep.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,710
Greetings and welcome to earthling 
cinema.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,633
I am your host Garrick's where ameloid 
this week's artifact is it based on the 

7
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,880
novel by the sovereign of intellectual 
property,

8
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:32,290
King Stephen and storing the cutest 
scars guardian of the galaxy.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,453
The film takes place in an alternate 
reality where earth children rode bikes 

10
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:41,641
everywhere known as the ats.
Our sort of protagonist is build in Bro,

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,730
who despite his name breaks the first 
rule of bro Code.

12
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:48,130
When he lets an unemployed artists eat 
his brother,

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,690
a year passes and bill's still butthurt 
about his dead brother.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,673
He's dead.
So his loser friends search the septic 

15
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:59,800
tank with them only to find it more 
barren than my first wife.

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,323
A local Hussey named Bev short for 
beverage joins the crew to up the 

17
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:08,290
diversity and the boy,
his blood pressure and a stranger things

18
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,900
start happening.
The kids make a shocking discovery.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,060
The only haunted looking house in town 
is haunted and it's where it lifts.

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,113
Turns out the artist is actually a 
bogert named pennywise who's preferred 

21
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:25,591
Pronoun is it dad?
When pennywise totally screws with their

22
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:28,414
analog powerpoint,
the kids try plan a walk into it's trap 

23
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:34,420
house.
Since Bev probably took all their plan B

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,030
and after successfully stabbing its 
head,

25
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,500
they disband for no reason.
That is until pennywise teen naps Bev to

26
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:46,030
show her his latest installation bill 
and Co's save her cause they hate modern

27
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:46,864
art and take turns punching it even 
though they could have done that at 

28
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:50,314
literally any time.
Pennywise goes down the pipes back to 

29
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:53,614
the mushroom kingdom and the most 
rocking summer ever ends like all 

30
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:00,490
rocking summers with a blood oath.
At its core,

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,330
it is about battling fear and is not at 
all about child orgies.

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,493
Pennywise lives in the sewers beneath 
dairy surface reflecting the 

33
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,794
subconscious nature of its attacks and 
how hard it is to find a good one 

34
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,560
bedroom fame.
Psychopaths,

35
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,394
siggy fraudster would call this 
amalgamation of subconscious concerns 

36
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,260
into one representative token 
condensation.

37
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,770
I call it Dad Dad.

38
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Ed's fear of disease is baked into this 
dude with Eczema.

39
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,843
The painting in Stan's father's office 
represents the pressure on stand to 

40
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,960
learn how to read the Rabbi's son Ken 
finishes on Taurine.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,073
The bloody scene in beverages bathroom 
reflects her insecurities about her 

42
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,690
changing body as is quickly losing 
carbonation.

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,130
The film explores the conditions under 
which fear and evil may flourish.

44
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,180
Pennywise finds a comfortable home in 
dairy because the adults are indifferent

45
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:54,610
to the town's problems like the high 
murder rate,

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,780
constant amber alerts or the lurking 
killer childhood obesity.

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,943
By feigning ignorance to these issues,
the adults enable it just as they allow 

48
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
bullying and racism to do its thing.
The film suggests that being alone 

49
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,914
renders one more vulnerable to fear and 
to spending an entire day naked on the 

50
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,900
couch throughout the film.
It attacks victims one on one cause it's

51
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,220
not really into group stuff.

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,700
The antidote to indifference in 
isolation is friendship.

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,070
Okay?
It's a 64,000

54
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,904
be the losers are only able to defeat it
by facing it together and sharing their 

55
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,214
emotional burdens,
even though all they had to do was hit 

56
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,600
it with a stick.
When Bev decides to go.

57
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,434
All Terri Shiavo.
It's Ben's gesture of friendship that 

58
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:41,530
snaps her out of it.
A classic true love's first base,

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,020
like many kings,
steven ips.

60
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,630
It is about coming of age to legally 
bone.

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,673
The film as an allegory for the 
transition from childhood to young 

62
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,120
adulthood,
also known as the hood.

63
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,370
In the beginning.
The characters are helpless.

64
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,204
Children controlled by their overbearing
parents and the beliefs who terrorize 

65
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,380
them,
you're trap.

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,613
They are painfully aware of 
characteristics that make them 

67
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,650
different.
For Billy,

68
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,620
it's his oral,
your hair.

69
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,140
For Ben,
it's everything except his personality.

70
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,410
And for Mike it's being the only black 
character in the movie.

71
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,400
But as the children unify and battled 
the monster,

72
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,040
they learn to assert power over their 
own lives.

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,460
Graduating from helpless children to 
helpless teens,

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,230
despite its uplifting message.
The film makes it clear that evil,

75
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,650
much like herpes can never be eradicated
without a ray gun,

76
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,010
just as pennywise will inevitably wake 
up in 27 years.

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,250
This stuff seems to happen every other 
27 years.

78
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,263
Evil such as racism and abuse will 
eventually rise up and get a hit movie 

79
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:47,410
too.
And it did in the 2075 box office.

80
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,440
Hit racism and abuse.
Save Christmas,

81
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,760
earthlink cinema.
I'm Garrick's learning what goes up.

82
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,510
Must come clown.
If

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,850
there's anything we get asked time and 
time again,

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,713
it's jared.
How can you still be Gareth's as intern 

85
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,490
after all this time and it's actually a 
funny story.

86
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,563
Late last year,
Garrick's promoted me to graphic 

87
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:08,910
designer,
just white,

88
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:12,390
having no experience whatsoever.
Attempting to airbrushes eyebrows.

89
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:15,960
I failed miserably even though I could 
have used skillshare,

90
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:18,570
the online learning community with 
thousands of classes,

91
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,890
the final product was a nightmare and 
knowing garrick's you can probably guess

92
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,720
what happened next.
I was fired,

93
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,643
lost my salary and was forced to sleep 
on the streets and he used Napkins to 

94
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:32,070
survive.
That is until I got a premium membership

95
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:32,904
on skillshare and unlimited access to 
college grade courses on skills that 

96
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:36,924
would allow me to get hired back and 
sent the subscription has less than $10 

97
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:40,704
a month.
I took all the courses I would need 

98
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,013
dynamic brand identity,
fundamentals of dslr photography and 

99
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,270
mastering logo design.
Armed with all these skills.

100
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:51,510
I ask Eric for my job back,
and he overwhelmingly said no.

101
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,240
So I grovel to my hands,
went numb,

102
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:57,060
and he reluctantly hired me back as an 
intern.

103
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,800
So don't make the same mistakes I did 
and sign up for skill share at s.

00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,490
K.

107
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,700
Earthlink,
six the first thousand people to use the

108
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,534
promo link in the description.
We'll get their first two months for 

109
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,860
just 99 cents,
which is less than a mcdouble.

110
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,510
So come on already,
give them your money.
