1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,850
Hey guys,
pilot season continues that wise crack.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,713
This one is another format that's going 
to deal with real world issues rather 

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,194
than focusing on media.
And another reason why we're excited 

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:09,774
about this one is this is a continuation
of a collaboration we've had going on 

5
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,374
for a while and that is with an artist 
named Jr who has been the illustrator 

6
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,750
for thug notes since the beginning.
She did all the art for this.

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,730
We're super excited to get it out into 
the world.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,560
Hope you guys enjoy it.
Let us know.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,573
And on with the show in October of 1992 
when the worldwide web was just a few 

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,103
years old and the idea of streaming 
terabytes of pornography was just a far 

11
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,674
fetched dream.
A presidential candidate had an 

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,383
interesting idea.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,100
I will have a unique mandate.
They were going to end the form,

14
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:44,934
the people in detail on the issues 
through an electronic town hall so that 

15
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,130
they really know what's going on.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,410
Perot wasn't talking about the Internet 
exactly.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,250
He wanted to use technology to 
revolutionize democracy.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,503
For instance,
televised town halls or debates could 

19
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,410
allow viewers to chime in with their 
phones.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,580
Press one for agree to for disagree like
many others,

21
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,414
parole believe new technology could 
break down barriers between decision 

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,100
makers and the average citizen.

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,630
Now all these phil is $1,000
suits and alligator shoes running up and

24
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,030
down the halls of Congress that make 
policy.

25
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:18,990
Now,
the lobbyists,

26
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,510
the pack guys,
the foreign lobbyist,

27
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:21,344
what have heavy,
they'll be over there in the 

28
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,640
Smithsonian,
you know,

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,710
we're going to get rid of them.
Wasn't

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,543
the first to suggest this kind of 
electronic democracy and he won't leave 

31
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,444
the last.
For those who lamented the corporate 

32
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:37,660
controlled media or the limited flow of 
information in authoritarian regimes,

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,010
the Internet was a godsend.
One wired article proudly announced that

34
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:46,390
netizens we're better informed and more 
civically engaged in they're unconnected

35
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,090
peers.
By 1997 emir,

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,983
8.5%
of the population was considered 

37
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,010
connected,
but they voted more,

38
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,963
had greater trust in democracy and we're
more likely to know basic information 

39
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,450
like who the chief justice is.
In other words,

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,950
these connected citizens were a bastion 
of light in the political ecosystem,

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,120
but has this light dimmed?
Was it ever there at all?

42
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,493
Sure,
we can now access unprecedented amounts 

43
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:16,270
of information,
but as you've probably guessed,

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,583
something is wrong with the Internet.
Let's fast forward to 2010 young people 

45
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,210
are doing exactly what futurists 
predicted,

46
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,313
connecting on twitter and coming out in 
the streets to protest oppressive 

47
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,670
regimes in Egypt,
Tunisia,

48
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,504
and elsewhere.

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,220
The media heralded the Arab spring as 
the first social media revolution,

50
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,270
the promise of the Internet inaction.
Before the Internet,

51
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,610
political organizing was risky.
Business,

52
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,600
stump speeches and flyer distribution 
were great ways to end up in jail.

53
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,823
Now,
in the age of tweets heard round the 

54
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,730
world,
one can instigate change from the safety

55
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:55,630
of one's own home until your movement is
too large to quell,

56
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,250
but despite the praise the Internet 
earned for his in the Arab spring,

57
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,383
some have argued that the uprisings 
proof that the internet can actually 

58
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,820
stifle politics.
Why?

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,833
Because in Egypt at least the real 
revolution didn't start until the 

60
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,424
Internet went dark on January 28th,
2011 after several days of widespread 

61
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,084
protests,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 

62
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,620
shutdown the country's internet like all
of it,

63
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,713
cell phones too in anticipation of what 
had been billed as the biggest of all 

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,633
days of rallies,
the government completely shut down the 

65
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,230
Internet in an attempt to stop people 
from communicating.

66
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,093
One paper argued that the lack of 
internet intensified revolutionary 

67
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,003
unrest in three ways.
He angered those who were otherwise 

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,833
unaware or uninterested in the unrest.
It forced more face to face 

69
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:51,010
communication and it decentralized the 
rebellion,

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,760
making it even harder to put down.
Similarly,

71
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,761
the Iranian revolution of 1978 and 1979 
took place only after a news blackout,

72
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,043
which raises another question.
What if exposure to information doesn't 

73
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,600
necessarily compel us to fix injustices 
or clamor for a better world,

74
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,350
but just makes us more content with the 
status quo?

75
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,090
The author was inspired by another paper
that looked at East Germans living under

76
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,520
communism who had access to Western 
media.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,610
I understand our gathering today as 
being broadcast as well.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,200
In the east to those listening in East 
Berlin a special word.

79
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,153
You might think that seeing a world of 
freedom would inspire the East Germans 

80
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:37,460
too to test their oppressive regime and 
spur them to rebel,

81
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,653
but it did exactly the opposite.
Eastern Germans with access to western 

82
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:47,480
TV found their life under communism more
tolerable than their peers without it.

83
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,530
TV offered an escape from food lines at 
state propaganda.

84
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,800
Why fight for a better world when you 
can just watch one?

85
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,023
Why jump over a shark on water skis if 
you can just watch the funds do it and 

86
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:03,980
why participate in politics when you can
just retweet someone else's virtue.

87
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,780
In 2014 researchers looked at the saved 
are for cause on facebook.

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,260
What they found at this point probably 
won't surprise you.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,760
The vast majority of caused members 
recruited no one else into the cause and

90
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:17,594
contributed no money to it,
suggesting facebook conjured and 

91
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:25,040
illusion of activism rather than 
facilitating the real thing.

92
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,593
To be fair.
There are counter examples like the als 

93
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:29,414
ice bucket challenge,
which raised unprecedented amounts of 

94
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:32,594
money to fight the disease,
but entering a credit card number is a 

95
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,860
lot different than being an engaged 
citizen where problems are a little more

96
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,410
complicated than dumping money into 
research.

97
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,993
And what about our electronic town halls
or the promise that digital citizens 

98
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:50,030
will be more informed than previous 
generations.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,193
In 2014 a pew research poll claimed that
thanks to the Internet at least people 

100
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,233
felt more informed,
but what should we make of feeling more 

101
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,950
informed?
Well,

102
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:05,951
as early as 1996 mit researchers 
prophetically declared that the internet

103
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,190
ran the risk of becoming what they 
referred to as a cyber Balkans,

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,440
like the countries of the Balkan 
peninsula,

105
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:16,010
which became increasingly fragmented and
hostile toward one another.

106
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,550
The Internet would create insular 
realities for its users.

107
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,863
In other words,
they identified echo chambers 20 years 

108
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,190
before everyone freaked out about them.

109
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
The point is access to information 
doesn't necessarily dispel falsehoods.

110
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,240
It can amplify them rather than 
discrediting flat earthers,

111
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,670
anti-vaxxers and whatever the hell goop 
is.

112
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,270
The Internet has helped them thrive.
And for the rest of us.

113
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,650
Why challenge your own perspectives when
you can find sources that think like you

114
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:49,520
do.
So what gifts as one philosopher notes,

115
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,790
as we produce more knowledge,
what we gained in Brett,

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,893
we lose in depth.
Everyone has an opinion but is never 

117
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,180
committed to act on it.
Why?

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,313
Because of what he considers to be two 
of the worst calamities of the modern 

119
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:04,184
era and an entity and the press.
But this philosopher wasn't talking 

120
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,554
about the internet or even the modern 
era because he died in 1855 what soren 

121
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:19,100
kierkegaard identified as problems in 
the 18 hundreds anonymity,

122
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,240
public opinion and arm chair 
intellectual wisdom have been given mega

123
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,074
steroids in the age of the Internet here
regard argued the press invited us to 

124
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,720
become detached spectators.

125
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,763
Divorcing thought from action ideas 
where homogenized as everyone began to 

126
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,654
read the same sources.
Now we read the same and hit like and 

127
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,200
share if we agree,
no independent thought needed,

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,860
but before getting too cynical,
should we ask,

129
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,843
is this the fault of the Internet itself
or things on it like facebook or 

130
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,740
Blowgun?
Paul,

131
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,203
there are tons of examples.
Some studied and some not of the bright 

132
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,270
side of the Internet,
times for the Internet helped organize a

133
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,440
community or connect old friends or let 
people explore who they really are.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,650
But rather than looking at specific 
content,

135
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,513
it's important to understand the modern 
internet as a system with a supreme 

136
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,270
mandate to produce knowledge,
specifically knowledge about you,

137
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,070
tailored for you and often produced by 
you.

138
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,310
The Internet isn't about what kind of 
knowledge is produced.

139
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,383
It's concerned with the ever 
accelerating exchange of information in 

140
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,250
general.
More photos,

141
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,830
more kickstarters,
more video watch time.

142
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,640
It's a system that cares about scale,
not quality,

143
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,683
not integrity.
And despite this ever increasing 

144
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:42,200
exchange of information,
the Internet seems to generate isolation

145
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:47,030
wherever it goes from early Internet 
studies that show users feel more lonely

146
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,320
and depressed on a micro level to the 
balkanization of our political landscape

147
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,183
on a macro level.
Whereas Internet evangelists thought 

148
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:58,500
that access to information would connect
people like never before.

149
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,060
It's managed to do exactly the opposite.
But Hey,

150
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
at least there's this Bay Bay Bay,

151
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,640
cause I don't know what happened.
Oh No.

152
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,660
Just say it.
Just say,

153
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:27,210
you love me,
me fall back into speed.

154
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,723
All right,
hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I 

155
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,460
did.
A lot of work went into this.

156
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,440
We've been working on it since about 
February.

157
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,610
We actually cited 36 different sources 
to make the script work,

158
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,613
so you guys can access that research as 
well as the research for all of our 

159
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,810
videos over@wisecrackplus.com
it's our patrion site.

160
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,703
It's because of our patrons that were 
able to do video experiments like this 

161
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,370
one.
Most importantly,

162
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,350
let us know what you guys think.
Drop us a comment.

163
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:16,184
Check out our other pilots,
the one on fake news and the film 

164
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,880
tourist.
Let us know what you guys like,

165
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:20,714
what you don't like.
Your feedback will let us know what we 

166
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:24,530
should continue doing,
so appreciate it guys.
