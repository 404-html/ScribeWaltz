00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,180
I think the celebrity chef phenomenon 
has been,

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,880
has gone on way longer than I expected 
it to be honest.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,530
Um,
uh,

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,640
I have worked at a couple of big food 
magazines,

5
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,980
food and wine and bon appetit in 
particular,

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,203
and I'm the celebrity chef phenomenon 
really started in the early to mid 

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,170
eighties.
It really kind of exploded at that time.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,200
Really led by people like emeril.
And um,

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,720
I think it's been fantastic for food.
I really do it because it exposed people

10
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,554
to different cuisines and cultures and 
brought everyone's palate's up 

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,113
tremendously.
I do think it's time for farmers to be 

12
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:48,490
the new celebrity chefs.
I really do.

13
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:49,890
I think that,
um,

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,793
they're kind of connection,
a vital connection to the food is so 

15
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:56,854
crucial and that they need to be getting
more of our claims and our love and 

16
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,550
thanks.
And,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,340
um,
while the chefs are a huge and important

18
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:08,680
conduit to translating those 
ingredients,

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,893
it has,
it all starts with the farmer and I 

20
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,600
would really like the farmer to be the 
next celebrity chef.
