00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,863
Hey wise crack jared again and today 
we're talking about everyone's favorite 

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:08,220
drug.
Addled Gandalf,

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,100
Alan Moore.
Alan Moore has authored many of the most

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,993
acclaimed comics of all time including 
watchman miracle man and the killing 

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,914
joke and like the joker and Batman and 
that story more straddles the thin line 

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,730
between genius and insanity.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,743
Oh,
decided it might be more interesting to 

8
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:26,924
actually terrified them.
Boy going completely mad and declared 

9
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,180
myself to be a magician.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,213
He calls himself a ritual magician,
not the kind that pulls Ravitz from 

11
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,714
hats,
but these Stephen strange variety that 

12
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:44,260
consults grimoires and conjures demons 
seriously at first glance.

13
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,094
Much of what more means by magic seems 
more like the superstitions of a man 

14
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,520
hitting his corn cob wizard pipe a 
little too hard,

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,473
but if we take more seriously for a bit,
there's a pretty fascinating philosophy 

16
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,124
at play here.
So what can we learn from a guy who 

17
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:01,180
claims he tried to end the world?
Well,

18
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:02,014
we're going to have to dive into a 
little known and even less understood a 

19
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:08,300
cult tradition known as hermeticism 
welcome us.

20
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,870
Wise crack addition on the philosophy of
Alan Moore.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,980
Today's topic is magic real.
There's a ton more to cover however,

22
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:16,720
so if you want more,

23
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,443
let us know in the comments.
But first a quick shout out to our 

24
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,474
sponsor hymns who allows men to turn to 
science rather than magic when it comes 

25
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,884
to hair loss.
Hims is a personalized and private 

26
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:30,794
online way for men to get access to 
medical grade products and connect with 

27
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:34,604
real doctors.
They offer solutions to treatable 

28
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:37,334
problems like hair loss and adult acne,
so you can hopefully look like Alan 

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,593
Moore well into your adult years.
They're also your one stop shop if 

30
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:46,070
you're looking for help in the boner 
department,

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,993
they've got science based treatments for
Ed and since 18 to 40 year old men are 

32
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,750
less likely than any other group to 
visit the doctor or pharmacy,

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,643
which is where you get your medicine.
I'm told Hams lets you chat with real 

34
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:00,980
doctors all online so you never have to 
leave the house again.

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,053
And because hymns offers generic 
equivalents to name brand prescriptions 

36
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,474
and direct shipment,
you're getting major savings that you 

37
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,210
can use for anything.

38
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,253
Hims is offering wisecrack viewers a 
full month trial of their comprehensive

More is a student of Hermeticism,

42
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,350
which is less a religion with set 
doctrines and more a set of interrelated

43
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:34,250
practices and principles hermeticism.
His goal is to seek understanding of the

44
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:36,380
world through three methods,
Alchemy,

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,040
astrology and fear g.
The first two are familiar enough,

46
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,874
but the third theory is basically the 
process of achieving spiritual 

47
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:47,900
perfection with the goal of growing ever
nearer to God.

48
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,003
Hermeticism is largely based on the 
teachings of the Corpus Hermetic up by 

49
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,694
the mythical Hermes Trismus justice.
He's a mixture of Hermes and thought 

50
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,194
both the Greek and Egyptian gods of 
language and wisdom respectively to 

51
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,474
more.
This mixture of language and 

52
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:07,621
understanding is the heart of magic in 
his upcoming the moon and serpent bumper

53
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:12,430
book of magic more defines magic as a 
purposeful engagement with the phenomena

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
and possibilities of consciousness.

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,453
So what does that mean?
Essentially Morris saying that what we 

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,580
call reality can be broken up into two 
categories.

57
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,503
Who material and the immaterial.
The material is all the physical stuff 

58
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,480
matter and energy,
space and time,

59
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:30,250
fundamental forces,
all that,

60
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,190
but we never experienced those things 
directly.

61
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,200
Photons hit our retina,
pressure,

62
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,700
waves,
impact or eardrums.

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,593
Those signals get sent to our brains and
based on that limited sensory 

64
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,164
information,
the brain makes a mental model of what 

65
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,400
it perceives the external world to be 
like.

66
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,413
That mental model is the immaterial to 
understand how the material and 

67
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,050
immaterial affect each other in profound
ways.

68
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,670
Let's think of watchman more had an 
ephemeral idea in his head for a story,

69
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,350
but it wasn't until artist Dave gibbons 
gave the idea form by penciling in those

70
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,184
panels that it achieved a four.
Moore's intangible thought had a 

71
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:10,270
tangible effect on the arrangement of 
the atoms that became watchman.

72
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,900
The opposite is true as well.
You're picturing in your mind's eye,

73
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,734
doctor Manhattan statuesque and 
uncensored Azor Fallis for no other 

74
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,294
reason than because I mentioning it,
the physical sound of my voice has 

75
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,050
altered your perception by conjuring 
that image in your mind.

76
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,973
I cast a genuine spell to more.
That's all magic is magic bridges the 

77
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:36,010
divide between the material and the 
immaterial art language symbols.

78
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,023
These are the real wizards wants per 
more magic is intrinsically connected 

79
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:41,764
with art,
language and consciousness to the point 

80
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,434
where these four things almost become 
different aspects of the same 

81
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,854
phenomenon.
This same principle as seen in the 

82
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,794
rabbit duck illusion.
At first glance you see either a rapid 

83
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,543
or a duck.
Just because someone's mind initially 

84
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,920
interpreted as duck doesn't mean that 
meaning is fixed.

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,933
All it takes is for someone to tell them
it's also a rabbit and all of a sudden 

86
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,340
it changes right before their eyes.

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,290
It's storytelling as spell craft.
Just as storytelling can be used to cast

88
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,124
illusions.
It can likewise dispel them as an 

89
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,304
anarchist.
More counts money among the more 

90
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,770
destructive illusions to ever distort 
mankind's collective conscious.

91
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,783
When miracle man tasks himself with 
making earth a utopia among the first 

92
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:25,894
things he does is abolish money.
Suddenly announcing money is a promise 

93
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,394
to redeem the cache of every bearer for 
its worth in gold or merchandise and 

94
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,773
empty promise.
Should we all demand at once redemption 

95
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:40,420
of our coins,
we learned such wealth does not exist.

96
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,570
Monies imaginary real.
If we believe in it,

97
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,770
come summer money won't exist,
but then it never did.

98
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,963
This method of magically altering 
something by changing the way you think 

99
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,803
is most clearly seen in promethium.
A notable example happens when 

100
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:01,321
protagonists has a rematch with the 
demon king as modus initially and co are

101
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,774
set on slaying asthma day in anger,
but it's only when they accept that so 

102
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,960
called demons are just a part of human 
nature.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,400
The worst parts that as modus is 
appearance shifts to that of a human.

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,530
He explains,
approached us with fear,

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,800
with hatred and revulsion and we will be
fearsome,

106
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
hateful,
and while approaches humanely and with 

107
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:25,880
respect and we will be human and 
respectable for the magician,

108
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
expectation creates perspective.
Even doctor Manhattan is a magician in 

109
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,110
this sense.
He externally appears as an ageless aqua

110
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:34,944
marine adonis with alopecia solely 
because this is how he internally 

111
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:39,254
perceives himself.
So if a sufficiently compelling story 

112
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,620
can magically change our perception of a
single phenomenon,

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,573
what happens if we tell a story that 
tries to account for all the phenomenon 

114
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,933
in existence more does exactly that in 
promethium telling a story about 

115
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,460
everything as a spell to change our 
perceptions about everything.

116
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,250
Of course,
we can never quite wrap our heads around

117
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,370
the infinite expanse of all space time,
but we don't need to.

118
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,413
One of her medicines,
his most famous principles is something 

119
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,900
called macrocosm and microcosm expressed
in the Maxim as above.

120
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:12,734
So below this principle presumes that 
every level of reality reflects every 

121
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:21,200
other like an infinite fractal or like 
how everything wrong with youtube can be

122
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,034
distilled down to Logan,
Paul and all the worst things about 

123
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,990
Logan Paul or echo throughout youtubes,
other channels.

124
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,063
Being able to understand one part of the
pattern allows you to better understand 

125
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,480
the whole and in turn move from lower 
levels to higher levels.

126
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,583
With promethium.
The entire structure of the series is 

127
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:42,630
deliberately based upon a specific 
structure that repeats at macro,

128
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:47,630
cosmic and micro cosmic levels from 
entire neve existence to each individual

129
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,970
soul,
the Kabbalah tree of life.

130
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,690
For more the tree of life is the roadmap
to all reality,

131
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,980
including our inner lives.
At the bottom rung is mere perception.

132
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,400
Seeing the rabbit or duck above that is 
imagination.

133
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,300
The ability to make mental models of 
things not directly apprehended with our

134
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,134
senses.
Above that is our capacity for art and 

135
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,014
language.
You build lead to tie ideas to sound 

136
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:12,314
symbols,
pictures and stories and above that our 

137
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,180
capacity for emotion and reason 
respectively.

138
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,283
At the macroscopic level,
the physical universe is the basis 

139
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,580
sphere of the world.
Soul.

140
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,623
Above that is everyone's collective 
unconscious and at the very top of the 

141
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:30,680
tree is what early her medicines called 
the all the one God.

142
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,933
That's why premia is 32 issues long 
corresponding to the 10 spheres and 22 

143
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,540
paths of the tree of life added 
together.

144
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,630
The story itself ends at issue 31 so he 
wrote a 32nd issue itself,

145
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:48,290
32 pages with each page expounding upon 
one of the paths.

146
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,363
Thus,
the issue was a deliberate microcosm of 

147
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:56,261
the series as a whole and the series a 
macrocosm of the issue or as above.

148
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,623
So below another hermetic principal used
by more is solve at Coagula or separate 

149
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:03,714
and combined basically breaking a thing 
down into its component parts to better 

150
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:07,894
understand how the whole fits together.
Dr Manhattan's are in watchman is all 

151
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:15,190
about him learning solve at Coagula.
When we first meet him,

152
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,024
he expresses an understanding of the 
first half separate better than anyone 

153
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:21,730
else.
He's detached from humanity because he's

154
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:24,880
mentally broken humans down into their 
base components,

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,500
not unlike his father did with watches.
His breakthrough on Mars is learning not

156
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:33,190
merely to break humans down into 
abstract arrangements of atoms.

157
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,173
In my opinion,
the existence of life is highly over 

158
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,290
right,
this phenomenon,

159
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:40,880
but

160
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,690
rather to conceptually recombine and 
perceive them as holistic.

161
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:49,190
Four dimensional objects solve at 
Coagula is seen even more clearly in the

162
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:50,024
sixth issue of promethium.
Sophie finds herself inside humanity's 

163
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,650
collective imagination and faces off 
with writer Marto Nip Tura the pseudonym

164
00:09:57,651 --> 00:10:00,590
for a writer of the promethium character
as a writer,

165
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,100
nip turns power over the land of fiction
is nearly absolute.

166
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,143
Sophie is only able to defeat him by 
understanding that nip Turo was the 

167
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:11,060
collective pen name of various 
novelists.

168
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,953
Cut Down to is separate unique styles.
So if a compelling story can change 

169
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:19,370
one's view of the world,
what happens when a story is so complete

170
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,204
a model of the world that it changes the
perception of our entire species for 

171
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:26,870
more.
When everyone's way of viewing the world

172
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:30,040
one way ends,
the world ends in promethium.

173
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,470
This is exactly the task that's sophie 
has given Margaret,

174
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,870
one of the prometheans before Sophie 
explains,

175
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,310
humans are amphibious.

176
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,440
That means they live in two worlds at 
once.

177
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,550
Matter and mind promethium makes people 
more aware of the fast,

178
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,490
immaterial realm.
Maybe tempts them to explore it.

179
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,310
Imagine if too many people followed 
where she led.

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,233
It would be like the great Devonian leap
from C to land to entity slithering up 

181
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:57,980
the beach from one element into another 
from matter to mind.

182
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,730
More believes that it was through a 
similar leap from matter to mind.

183
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,400
Vet Our ideas about the world began in 
the first place.

184
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,420
Representation allows for the 
origination of verbal language with this

185
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:09,254
sound or this collection of mark.
Somehow also standing for that buffalo 

186
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:13,154
over their language is the necessary 
precursor of are apparently unique form 

187
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:17,594
of consciousness.
Humanity's first purposeful engagement 

188
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,070
with the phenomenon and possibilities of
consciousness.

189
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,320
Out of this engagement sprang almost 
full blown the entirety of human culture

190
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,790
writing,
painting,

191
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,860
Song,
Usic Theater,

192
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
science,
medicine,

193
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,710
and even politics.

194
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,700
And so in the same way that this idea of
the world began,

195
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,940
it also ends in the series penultimate 
issues.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,050
Sophie succeeds in bringing about the 
apocalypse by explaining to everyone the

197
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,450
same hermetic principles we've been 
talking about.

198
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,160
Everyone now perceives the immaterial 
and the material worlds as equally real.

199
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,173
But while permia bringing about the 
world's end within the comics more was 

200
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:01,291
contemplating how our world will end in 
a similar fashion in the 12th issue more

201
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:02,434
uses the Taro to trace the history of 
the world from the initial quantum 

202
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:06,394
vacuum and God big bang,
the universe into existence all the way 

203
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,204
to the coming leap to expanded 
consciousness more places his own doom 

204
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:17,650
say cock quite close to midnight,
like his character roar shack carrying a

205
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:18,484
sign that says the end is nigh.
How near riding that issue in 1999 more 

206
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:27,460
predicted the end of the world as we 
know it would occur in 2017 when the sum

207
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,294
total of our knowledge would double at a
rate of every half second with so much 

208
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,674
new knowledge coming so quickly,
our old ways of understanding the world 

209
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,940
wouldn't be able to keep up and we 
naturally need new ways of understanding

210
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:40,774
the new world.

211
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,793
Those of you alive back in 2017 may 
recall that the world did not in fact 

212
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:46,684
come to an end,
but before the year came and went more 

213
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:53,350
himself tried like his character 
promethium to herald the apocalypse.

214
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,184
At the hour heat appointed in September 
of 2016 on the eve of his prophesized 

215
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,540
worlds in more released his magnum opus 
Jerusalem.

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,553
If promethium was a spell,
he has to magically change the minds of 

217
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,800
individual readers.
Jerusalem was the ritual he performed to

218
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:09,634
bring about worldwide revelation as more
himself a test rather than performing a 

219
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,794
ritual to produce a successful book.
The book itself is the 10 year ritual 

220
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,770
working that is intended to have a 
certain,

221
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,430
hopefully beneficial effect upon the 
consciousness of its readership.

222
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,600
Jerusalem seems to me to be my most 
sophisticated and complex,

223
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:32,770
magical working thus far and certainly 
the most ambitious in its aims.

224
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,010
Ambitious in its aims is an 
understatement.

225
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,963
More rights in such a way that the 
reader experiences the higher states of 

226
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,194
consciousness that the narrative is at 
the same moment describing not this 

227
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,184
similar to the way the heptopods 
language in a rifle profoundly affects 

228
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:48,874
lois lane's perception of time.
This is especially evident in a chapter 

229
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:52,894
told from the perspective of Lucy,
a joist during her confinement in an 

230
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:56,404
asylum in employees,
the same linguistic style found in her 

231
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:01,390
father's novel,
Finnegan's wake abounding in puns,

232
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:02,224
portmanteaus and the alogia slums in 
order to replicate Lucy as condition 

233
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,513
more explorers.
How those exhibiting certain forms of 

234
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:09,364
insanity might be closer to perceiving 
external reality than those who are 

235
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,014
deemed quote sane in watchmen.
Doctor Manhattan perceives every moment 

236
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,514
of his life simultaneously a far 
different perception than quote sane 

237
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:26,350
individuals.
But more like Einstein regards time as a

238
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,213
stubbornly persistent illusion.
So the fact that Manhattan is not taken 

239
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:33,520
in by this delusion of time makes him 
more sane,

240
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,600
not less.

241
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,523
It's we who are deficient for perceiving
only the now rather than being able to 

242
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,780
gaze upon the past,
present and future.

243
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:44,380
Like we might take three dimensional 
plane in order to get us in the habit of

244
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,214
perceiving the dimensions which we might
not initially perceive more employees 

245
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:49,504
solve at Coagula to language itself.
Taking apart the written word into its 

246
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:55,490
base components,
separating phonetics,

247
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,340
how vocalized words sound from Graph 
Fenix,

248
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,233
how written words appear more writes 
dialogue as a series of words that look 

249
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:06,050
like Jibberish,
but when read phonetically makes sense,

250
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,093
more forces the readers who read 
multiple layers of meaning in every 

251
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,730
word.
For example,

252
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:13,370
if you read this aloud,
you get the phonetic dimension.

253
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,323
Her father in his time maintains that we
are in a universe composed of four 

254
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:18,674
dimensions,
only three of which are naturally 

255
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,990
visible.
This phonetic dimension is only one side

256
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,720
of the techs and if it's the only part 
we observe,

257
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,150
we miss out on its other possible 
meanings.

258
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,240
The jibberish is full of double 
Entendre,

259
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,193
like spelling dimension in a way that 
resembles dementia or universe in a way 

260
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,534
that resembles loony more teaches us to 
read with more dimensions than we 

261
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:46,910
normally perceive in a text about how 
the universe has more dimensions than we

262
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:50,750
normally perceive.
It's explanation and example at the same

263
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,584
time magically changing how our mind 
models of the world by changing the 

264
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:57,800
language with which our minds construct 
that model.

265
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,903
Of course,
even if everyone in the whole world did 

266
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,860
read Jerusalem and have their minds 
expanded by more,

267
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,813
it doesn't necessarily follow that.
We'd make the great leap from the murky 

268
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,420
waters of matter to the solid land of 
ideas and imagination.

269
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,583
While more may not have managed to bring
about his revelation in 2017 given his 

270
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,160
status as the most influential writer in
the history of comics,

271
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,570
his literary efforts are likely to 
remain influential for centuries.

272
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,570
So is magic real?
If more is right,

273
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,000
it's at least as real as our 
imagination.

274
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,270
This is prometheans revelation that ends
the world.

275
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,820
Speaking not to any of the characters in
the comic,

276
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,430
but to you the reader.
I'm an idea,

277
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,510
but I'm a real idea.
I'm the idea of human imagination,

278
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,643
which when you think about it is the 
only thing we can really be certain 

279
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,330
isn't imaginary.
See,

280
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,433
I'm imagination.
I'm real and I'm the best friend you 

281
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,550
ever had.
Who Do you think got you?

282
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,980
All this cool stuff.
The clothes you're wearing,

283
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,570
the room,
the house,

284
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,670
the city that you're in,
everything in.

285
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:01,910
It started out in the human imagination,
your lives,

286
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:03,920
your personalities,
your whole world,

287
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,060
all invented,
all made up and there's nothing here but

288
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:08,894
a funny little twist of amino acids 
playing a marvelous game of pretend to 

289
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:16,100
that list of cool stuff that imagination
has given us.

290
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,000
We can certainly add the highly 
imaginative works of Alan Moore.

291
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,283
Thanks for going down this weird and 
wacky rabbit hole with us and if you 

292
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:24,794
want to spend more time with the wise 
crack crew as we continue to go down 

293
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:27,794
these weird and wacky rabbit holes,
then I recommend punching our logo in 

294
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:34,010
the face to check out the whys cast 
channel where we have video,

295
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,390
podcast,
special clips,

296
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,224
and even a new vlog format coming soon.
So if you like what we do and want to 

297
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:39,734
see more of us subscribe to wise casts 
and I'll see you on the other side 

298
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,723
piece.
