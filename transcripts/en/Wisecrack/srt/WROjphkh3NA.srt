00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,420
This video is brought to you by wix 
villains.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,690
Oftentimes,
the best part of a movie can't live with

3
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,524
them,
can't feed them to a pack of rabid 

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,384
hyenas.
Usually villains are the people we love 

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,310
to hate or fear with the occasional 
motor.

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,144
Come have empathy,
but something has been happening with 

7
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,634
villains lately.
If you found yourself nodding along to 

8
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,514
the logic of a diabolical plot or 
feeling more empathetic than usual 

9
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:29,100
towards a film's antagonist,
you're not alone.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,113
Today's villains from killmonger and 
Black Panther to screen slaver and 

11
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,880
incredible to have become weirdly 
relatable,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,970
each equipped with their own cogent 
critiques of the world.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,210
People will trade quality for ease every
time.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,133
Villainy is and always has been a 
reflection of the value systems and 

15
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:47,724
fears of the time.
So how did we get from this to this and 

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,240
what does it say about our past and our 
world today,

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,363
or we're gonna find out in this 
wisecrack addition on the cinematic 

18
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,580
history of villainy and warning.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,770
There's a ton of spoilers here for 
movies,

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,960
both old and new,
but before we do that,

21
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,510
want to give a quick shout out to our 
sponsor over at Wix,

25
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,750
look like Comic Sans and Papayas had a

28
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,460
eating donuts,

or by clicking the link in the 
description and now onto the villainy.

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,863
To understand how we got here,
we have to explore multiple arrows and 

34
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:49,620
see how film villains embody the spirit 
and anxieties of the times.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,060
Now,
a quick disclaimer,

36
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,460
none of these trends are absolute 
villains,

37
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,310
can break the mold or jump back into the
past for inspiration,

38
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:00,000
but what we're discussing here are 
noticeable trends among some of the most

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,893
enduring films of each era.
We're going to start our journey from 

40
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:07,800
these simple mustache twirling villain 
to the complex philosophizing radical by

41
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,470
looking at the 19 fifties and early 19 
sixties,

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,483
the height of the war that wasn't hot in
the post World War party in the suburbs 

43
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:19,380
era of American history describing our 
world seemed pretty simple.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,950
We were the heroes who saved the world 
from the evil Nazis,

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,910
and we're now tasked with staving off 
the also evil Ussr.

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,660
It was very black and white,
and so where are villains?

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,823
Well,
yeah,

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,693
literally,
but also metaphorically movie screens 

49
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,560
were full of bad Russian people,
bad Asian people,

50
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,394
and very bad aliens.
What do all these naughty dudes have in 

51
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,220
common?
They're the other inherent,

52
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,143
inexplicably evil that stoked on 
destroying America and our apple pie 

53
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:48,984
values sometimes that other took the 
form of an amorphous read for Kami blob 

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,783
or the creature from the black lagoon.
Other times the other was an alien 

55
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:57,774
hatched in a pod and designed to look 
exactly like you as in the invasion of 

56
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,684
the body snatchers,
which some critics say represented the 

57
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,070
fear of communist brainwashing and 
infiltration,

58
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,260
and you're reborn into an untroubled 
exactly what a world.

59
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,053
Also in the fifties,
the movie industry went way back to 

60
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,054
basics British thing,
a number of biblical Sagas with running 

61
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,951
times of four hours or more of these 
expensive epics proved massively popular

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,250
with three ranking in the top 10 highest
grossing films of the decade.

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,143
Perhaps this was partially because they 
so perfectly embodied cold war 

64
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,744
propaganda which depicted a face off 
between God fearing Americans and the 

65
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,550
godless communist Ben Hur showed an 
aristocratic Jews being persecuted by an

66
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,100
Evil Roman commander while quo Vadis 
pits.

67
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:49,180
New Christian converts against the Evil 
Emperor Nero and his Roman Empire.

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,280
A world is mine and mine,
and the 10 commandments depicts good old

69
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,950
Moses staring down the Egyptian Emperor 
Ramses.

70
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,130
These films all portrayed the Noble 
Judeo Christian taking on a cruel,

71
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
powerful,
desperate of a non monotheistic 

72
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,364
religion.
These villains were representative of 

73
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,990
larger groups of bad people who want it 
to cancel baseball.

74
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:12,100
Tupperware parties,

75
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,080
rain is not only been washed as they 
say,

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,000
just being dry,
clean,

77
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,940
even when villains weren't explicitly 
foreign or pagan.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,833
They were just anti American communists,
double agents as seen in a flurry of 

79
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:27,794
cold war propaganda films later spy 
mania of the 19 sixties would also 

80
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,144
reflect cold war anxiety with James Bond
facing off against various agents have 

81
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,404
smashed the imaginary Russian 
intelligence agency not to remain that 

82
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,643
much longer.
What all these movies had in common was 

83
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:45,854
an US versus them mentality with no good
commies portrayed as pure and simply 

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,313
evil.
One dimensional foreign slash communist 

85
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:54,224
slash alien slash blog villains took a 
backseat in the late sixties and 

86
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,770
seventies as we saw a definitive shift 
in the portrayal of villains.

87
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,790
It was fitting for a time of major 
social turbulence and soul searching.

88
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,430
As the civil rights movement and Vietnam
made visible,

89
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,630
some of the not so perfect aspects of 
America like racism and war,

90
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,010
this period also saw a startling drop in
public trust of government,

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,840
a phenomenon that changed movie villains
dramatically as outrage over the war met

92
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,520
outrage about Nixon's tapes.

93
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,170
Notably 19 seventies movies shined a 
light on the corrupt social systems that

94
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:29,660
Americans were increasingly 
disillusioned with.

95
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,370
Evil politicians and public officials 
loomed large popular political thriller.

96
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:35,204
All the president's men brought the 
Watergate scandal to the big screen in 

97
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:38,594
1976.
Fictional accounts also touched on 

98
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:44,330
institutional corruption like in Steven 
Spielberg's jaws,

99
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,283
which depicts a crooked mayor who cares 
more about tourism revenue then keeping 

100
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:51,160
people from becoming shark bait.
For Christ's sake,

101
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,440
Kumar's the fourth of July at we will be
open for business.

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,390
It's going to be one of the best summers
we've ever had.

103
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,253
Further depictions,
the evil in mighty came in Chinatown in 

104
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,674
which these sinister billionaire rejects
audiences judgments of him by claiming 

105
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,830
that his evil acts were brought about by
his environment.

106
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,040
People never have to face the fact the 
right time,

107
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,130
the right place,
they're capable of anything.

108
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,083
The suggestion is that circumstances 
have power make the villain rather than 

109
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:19,254
any innate nature.
Corrupt cop films where another popular 

110
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:22,824
way of portraying the power struggles 
taking place serpico based on a true 

111
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:26,904
story,
depicts a world in which police 

112
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:30,090
corruption is an assumed fact.

113
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,550
You're fine,
you're fine without a warning,

114
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,040
right in your head.

115
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,023
In this world,
bribes and brutality are the coffee and 

116
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:41,820
donuts of police work,
so much so that Alba,

117
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,653
Chino Serpico,
is distrusted because he's not willing 

118
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:45,900
to accept bribes.
Let's face it,

119
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,400
who can dress the cabin?
We don't take money.

120
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,420
Corrupt cops were mainstays on the big 
screen popping up in the Godfather,

121
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,343
white lightening,
the French connection and the 

122
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:54,294
conversation to name a few institutions,
it seems had lost their presumption of 

123
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,640
goodwill,
and as a result,

124
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,910
we started seeing villains who embodied 
the very broken systems.

125
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,744
People were angry about take nurse 
ratchet from one flew over the cuckoo's 

126
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,254
nest who turned a benevolent profession 
into one that turns a vivid individuals 

127
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,860
into drugged up dependent ghosts of 
themselves.

128
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,803
You're no crazier in the average ass 
flat walking around on the streets and 

129
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,190
that's it.

130
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,010
In a similarly bleak depiction of 
institutionalization.

131
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,933
Escape from Alcatraz renders prisoners 
sympathetic heroes struggling against 

132
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:25,954
the efforts of an evil warden.
Something very similar can be seen in 

133
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:31,000
cool hand luke.
In all these cases,

134
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,090
the person tasked with imposing law and 
order or societal norms is recast as the

135
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:37,804
villain.
The 19 seventies further muddied the 

136
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:40,354
waters by blurring the line between hero
and villain and told the distinctions 

137
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,284
became all but meaningless.
These characters are depicted as 

138
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:47,494
conflicted,
heavily flawed protagonists with 

139
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:52,420
questionable even hideous morals in 
Martin Scorsese's.

140
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:57,040
Nineteen 76 film taxi driver,
Travis bickle is one such heroic villain

141
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,470
or villain is hero depending on your 
perspective.

142
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,353
He swings on the pendulum of violently 
bad to violently good ish as it goes 

143
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,810
from plotting to gun down a presidential
candidate,

144
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,260
the plotting to rescue a 12 year old 
prostitute in the previous years.

145
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,220
Dog Day,
afternoon,

146
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,000
novice crook and hero slash villain 
Sunny Warcek botches,

147
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:19,540
a bank robbery and spontaneously takes 
all the workers hostage.

148
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,523
However,
we soon learned the reason for sunny's 

149
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,790
dalliance with crime.
He needed the money to help his wife,

150
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,730
Leon get sexual reassignment surgery 
right away.

151
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,400
Sonny wanted to get me money for the sex
change operation,

152
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,670
but when is he going to get it?
We find out that sunny is a quality dude

153
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:37,510
who pays his parents rent and doesn't 
typically go around holding up banks,

154
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,480
not your villain of the past.
Meanwhile,

155
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,314
one particularly popular series.
Star wars stands out as markedly 

156
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,170
simplistic in this era of more complex 
villains.

157
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,213
It might seem to counter our theory as 
it presents a pretty basic black and 

158
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,234
white paradigm of good versus evil,
even if it goes against the grain later 

159
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:57,360
on with he walks reminiscent of the Viet
Cong.

160
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,023
The 19 eighties backpedaled hard on the 
anti villain by reveling in more 

161
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,164
cartoonish villains who directly 
embodied the biggest threats of time 

162
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,393
effectively,
it ushered back in an US versus them 

163
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:13,860
paradigm by tapping into the fear 
surrounding the war on drugs.

164
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,873
Unsurprisingly,
the villains of the time wanted a piece 

165
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,364
of that sweet,
sweet drug money in films like scarface 

166
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,520
to live and die in La.
Beverly Hills cop and raw deal,

167
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,683
this depiction of evil drug lords could 
be seen as a Yin Yang response to the 

168
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,250
less than savory cops of the seventies.
Films Take Tango and cash,

169
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,084
which depicted to roguish cops who are 
treated as irrepressible protagonists 

170
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,930
despite engaging in some of the exact 
same violence,

171
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:40,764
serpico condemned,
however they're portrayed as the best 

172
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,180
cops in the city because they're 
unconventional.

173
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,014
Tactics have costs.
Local drug lord and rat kissing villain 

174
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,980
Eve's Perrey oodles of money then said 
kingpin,

175
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,823
as if schooled in the bad cup films of 
the seventies gets them falsely 

176
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,454
incriminated for murder.
The film ultimately comes down hard on 

177
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:02,280
the side of cops and a by any means 
necessary model of policing.

178
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,293
I've been a policeman for 12 years and I
think it's the best organization in the 

179
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:08,280
country.

180
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,113
At the same time,
the decade saw the resurgence of cold 

181
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,574
war anxieties as president Ronald Reagan
increased military spending and ended 

182
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,414
arms control.
Americans rediscovered their fear of 

183
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,350
nuclear war.
At the same time,

184
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,320
evil Russians had their moment in the 
sun with films like rocky,

185
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:26,400
for which remain the highest grossing 
sports flick until 2009.

186
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,443
It's also been accused of being pure 
anti Soviet propaganda because of its 

187
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,370
villain Soviet boxer,
Ivan Drago,

188
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,550
who was decidedly not a charmer,
the film red heat,

189
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,553
really one the villain jackpot in its 
depiction of Soviet drug lord Victor 

190
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,523
Rostow,
who in a Trifecta of evil also murdered 

191
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,564
the protagonist partner,
but arguably the clearest example of 19 

192
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,240
of these cold war villains came with 
1984 is red dawn,

193
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,300
which imagine Soviet forces invading 
America and worse,

194
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,330
taking photos in our national parks.
The film's director,

195
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,164
John Milius,
explicitly saw the film as a warning to 

196
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,014
Americans to take seriously the threat 
of the Soviet invasion by a Central 

197
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,030
America.

198
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,750
And if this seems like a scaremonger for
you,

199
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,733
consider that Melius was the direct 
inspiration for this guy multimode 

200
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,743
front,
you're entering a world of pain despite 

201
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,534
some return to the other as the enemy.
There are hints of the seventies 

202
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:19,694
skepticism towards institutions in the 
19 eighties when villains are not pure 

203
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,380
character traits.
From an Ansi Reagan fever dream,

204
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,690
we see them continue exploiting corrupt 
institutions for personal gain.

205
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,550
Gordon greed is good.
Gecko,

206
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,384
for instance,
uses the corrupt financial industry to 

207
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:37,980
fulfill his own gold plated desires.
Meanwhile,

208
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,180
diehards,
Hans Gruber,

209
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:42,180
emerges as one for decades.
Most enduring villains,

210
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,133
when he and his cronies sees a high rise
building and take hostages during a 

211
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,034
Christmas party,
operates under the guise of being a 

212
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:49,614
terrorist,
exacting revenge on an Evil Corporation 

213
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,950
director.
The Naca trauma corporations legacy

214
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
agreed around the globe.
They are about to be taught a lesson in 

215
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,350
the real useful,

216
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,010
but interestingly enough,
his moral high ground crumbled when it's

217
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:06,780
revealed that just like Gordon Gekko,
he's really only after cold hard cash.

218
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,050
This is all about the robbery.

219
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,793
The whole building odds are under $600.
You can just disappear when you still 

220
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:24,210
$600 million.
They will find you unless you're already

221
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:24,730
dead.

222
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,490
In the nineties,
American cinema swapped out the reds for

223
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,324
homegrown terrorists to fit a decade in 
which domestic terrorism and going 

224
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,900
postal dominated headlines Fittingly in 
cinema.

225
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,800
It was an era of disgruntled Middleclass
dudes and bombers next door,

226
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,420
a prime time for complex anti villains 
who are fighting small localized battles

227
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,240
by radical means,
take the villain from speed.

228
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,074
Howard Payne,
this former bomb squad officer turned 

229
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,950
extortionist,
turned psychopathic.

230
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,650
Terrorists is partially motivated by 
that suite.

231
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:54,484
Three point $7,000,000,
but he also expresses a sense of 

232
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,420
superiority.

233
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,310
You still don't get it,
dad,

234
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,390
Jack,
a bomb was made to explode.

235
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,830
That's its meaning,
its purpose.

236
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,620
That's bananas,
but it's a hint of philosophy,

237
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,230
a motivation beyond cold,
hard cash.

238
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,720
Howard's more complicated than say 
gruber,

239
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:19,750
in that he genuinely desires meaning and
purpose.

240
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,690
It just goes about getting them in the 
worst way possible.

241
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,823
Same goes for Kevin Spacey,
supremely sadistic John Doe in the 1995 

242
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,204
films,
seven who sees himself as a chosen 

243
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:32,270
warrior in the crusade against everyday.
Since

244
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,460
we see a deadly sin on every street 
corner in every home and we tolerate it,

245
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,710
we tolerate it because it's common 
sense.

246
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,880
It's trivial.
We tolerate it.

247
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,561
Morning,
noon,

248
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,550
and night.
Well,

249
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:49,551
not anymore.
I'm setting the example.

250
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,703
By the end of the decade,
Arlington Road became the pinnacle of 

251
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:56,290
the domestic terrorists genre,
who's villain mans the girl at the block

252
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,750
party as he carries out plans for his 
militant groups,

253
00:13:58,751 --> 00:13:59,980
latest deadly bombing.

254
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,043
I'm a mess.
There's millions of waiting to take up 

255
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,510
arms ready to spread the word.

256
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,330
He claims to be pursuing a lofty noble 
goal,

257
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,343
but within his critique of government is
also an indictment of the supposed 

258
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,570
niceties of Clinton era prosperity.

259
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,980
Are you happy in your godless

260
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,383
trouble in suburbia?
Also bounded in American beauty which 

261
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:25,730
depicted the enemy as lester's neighbor 
be homophobic.

262
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,564
Nazi memorabilia.
Hoarding Frank Fits who kills Lester 

263
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:31,490
after he rebuffs his romantic 
advancements.

264
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,683
In both cases,
the villains feel victimized by the 

265
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,930
system or circumstance and seek justice 
on their own terms.

266
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,093
Sometimes these villains have genuinely 
noble causes as they rail against the 

267
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:46,240
systems that have long take.
Nineteen 95.

268
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,800
The Rock in which Ed Harris has general 
humble,

269
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,783
a disgraced USFC.
SMC Brigadier General threatens a nerve 

270
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,084
gas attack on San Francisco.
15 vx gas rockets into the hardest San 

271
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,463
Francisco.
You've got 17 hours to deliver the 

272
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,024
money,
demanding that the families have slain 

273
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,244
marines be compensated for their deaths.
Here we come to an interesting question 

274
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:08,210
of whether noble ends justified by what 
means in this way,

275
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,044
the film acts as a prelude to the 
questions being explored by current day 

276
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,360
villains,
though usually on a much wider scale,

277
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,343
movies couldn't not be changed by an 
event as pivotal as nine slash 11 and 

278
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,454
the subsequent war on terror with the 
two thousands came a new shift in movie 

279
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,294
villains,
as America confronted an existential 

280
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,530
threat to its sense of safety and power 
in the world.

281
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,663
Fittingly the first two installments of 
Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy 

282
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:33,500
captured the Popular Imagination.
In this decade.

283
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,543
In 2005 Batman begins,
we see the dangerous metropolis under 

284
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,354
attack by an international terrorist 
group called the League of shadows and 

285
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,870
its leader rouse.
Oh,

286
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:44,900
cool.
Who in remarkably on the nose metaphor,

287
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,600
wants to blow up Gotham's tallest 
skyscraper.

288
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,240
Arguably the decades most salient 
villain came,

289
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,223
of course,
with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the 

290
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:53,834
joker in the dark knight.
The joker manifests as the spirit of 

291
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:59,900
terrorism,
the embodiment of anarchy and chaos of a

292
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,480
particularly destructive and nihilistic 
nature.

293
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,610
As critic Douglas Kellner writes in his 
book,

294
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:05,444
Cinema Wars,
the only sensible way to live in this 

295
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:07,634
world is without rules in case the 
comparison between the joker and real 

296
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:14,210
world terrorism wasn't clear enough.
Calendar notes that the film is bursting

297
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,044
with nine slash 11 iconography.
Nolan's film also gave us one of two 

298
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,490
coin flipping evildoers with the 
character of Harvey Dent alias to face,

299
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,473
a representation of how a confrontation 
with the joker's evils can corrupt even 

300
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,600
the noblest person to face goes about 
deciding people's fates,

301
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,583
do a plunge into a completely 
meaningless existence of pure 

302
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:35,060
contingency and nihilism.

303
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,740
Meanwhile,
the Coen brothers,

304
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,633
Anton sugar from no country for old men 
also uses a coin to decide the fate of 

305
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:41,954
his victims.
He doesn't kill out of greed self or 

306
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,163
some kind of practical goal.
Leading one character to comment is a 

307
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,674
peculiar man might even say he has 
principles transcend money or drugs or 

308
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,300
anything like that.
Indeed,

309
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,134
sugar is quite simply an active 
nihilists who believes that if all 

310
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:00,974
morality is contrived,
a coin flip is as good a way as any to 

311
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:04,634
decide who lives and dies,
but you don't need a coin to affirm the 

312
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,340
random or meaningless nature of our 
lives are deaths.

313
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,790
Take Martin Scorsese's 2006,
film the departed,

314
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,683
which featured Jack Nicholson as chief 
gangster Frank Costello from merciless 

315
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,154
killing.
She felt funny to his refusal to 

316
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:22,934
subscribe to any rules.
I don't want to be a product of my 

317
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:30,731
environment.
I want my environment to be a product of

318
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:31,400
me.

319
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,233
Frank's action seems shaped by the 
belief that life is meaningless as you 

320
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,130
will act accordingly.
Frank,

321
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,830
who we later find out was an FBI 
informant sees life as one long struggle

322
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,723
during which any actions that sustain 
you for just one more day are entirely 

323
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,960
excusable.
Of course,

324
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,930
plenty of other villain archetypes 
punctuated the two thousands,

325
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,883
but if the two thousands where a time 
when the villain is creed was no credit 

326
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:00,780
at all.
We've come a long way since then.

327
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,913
Today are villains are the product of an
increasingly divided America bracing 

328
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,740
itself for impact with trust in 
government,

329
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,020
media,
and religious faith at all time.

330
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:10,854
Lows,
villains reflect America's innate 

331
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,880
skepticism towards systems.
Any systems,

332
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,773
all the systems villain simply embody 
solutions that are way too radical and 

333
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,574
usually mind bogglingly violent,
the polar opposite of a 19 fifties 

334
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,843
villain who represented an evildoer 
infiltrating and inherently good system 

335
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:29,034
in hopes of corrupting it.
Today's villains increasingly face 

336
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,770
objectively evil systems which they want
to change for the better.

337
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,843
The only thing that makes these 
characters villains rather than starry 

338
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,280
eyed heroes is their means of carrying 
out that change.

339
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,380
You agree to end the war on drugs once 
and for all.

340
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,890
My colleagues and I received full legal 
immunity.

341
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,700
The classic caveat of,
Hey man,

342
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,040
you'd be really cool if we weren't 
trying to kill half the world.

343
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,993
For instance,
Black Panthers killmonger played by 

344
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,364
Michael B.
Jordan has an entirely legitimate 

345
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:57,794
critique of how the world treats its 
black citizens and will conduct past 

346
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,420
severity as they suffer.
In fact,

347
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,254
killmonger would argue that the real 
villains of the film are Wakandans who 

348
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:06,584
sit on a stockpile of vibranium while 
pretending to be a helpless third world 

349
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:10,634
country.
We're killmonger is perspective gets 

350
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:14,170
debatably.
Tricky is in the means.

351
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,103
He wants to ship bill condon weapons all
over the world and instigate a militant 

352
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,330
uprising.
The world's going to start over,

353
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:25,331
and this time we're on top.
The Sun will never set on the will.

354
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,324
Conduct empire,
though to Cholla defeats him and stops 

355
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:28,934
the scheme.
He does go to the UN to admit Wakanda's 

356
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,054
real capacities and even establishes a 
candy and outreach center in Oakland 

357
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,060
suggesting an end to Wakanda is 
isolationism.

358
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,073
So killmonger is radicalism,
actually brought about a less radical 

359
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,260
but positive change in policy.
Then there's mission impossible.

360
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:49,040
Six is new utilitarian villain,
August walker slash jog Lark,

361
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,023
who wants to destroy a third of the 
world in the hopes that the other two 

362
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,070
thirds would come together in the wake 
of the attacks,

363
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,113
or as he says,
there's never been peace without first 

364
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,054
the great suffering or the suffering 
that created the piece or if it any 

365
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:06,290
worse than those who wants to kill half 
of everyone to solve resource scarcities

366
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,830
that play for universe or incredibles,
two's bill and screen slaver.

367
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,763
We use uses hypnotic screens to mind,
control her minions or personal beef 

368
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,624
with the system that the endless 
repackaging of life into consumable 

369
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,164
media has made us all lazy.
Passive observers and that superheroes 

370
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,513
are an integral part of the equation,
keeping us docile and meet her plan to 

371
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,600
change the system.

372
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,603
Mind control superheroes and ruined 
their public approval rating so people 

373
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,870
will learn that they have to protect 
themselves.

374
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,943
What all these villains share is a 
majorly out their plan that appeals to 

375
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:37,964
our country's growing fears.
That the world is screwed beyond repair 

376
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,330
and the only way to fix it is to tear it
all down.

377
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,850
In this brave new world of villainy,
we're able to,

378
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,560
with the villains critique of the system
and their desire to change it.

379
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,650
In this through the looking glass 
reinterpretation of Villainy,

380
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,330
the heroes are almost inevitably cast as
slightly flawed protectors of the status

381
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:01,600
quo that no one's really happy with.
In the grand scheme of things,

382
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:02,434
contemporary villains seemed to be a 
weird mirror image of fifties villains 

383
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,663
who want to corrupt good institutions.
Whereas killmonger types want to effect 

384
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,140
good change in corrupt institutions.
They just go about it in very bad ways.

385
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,273
At the same time,
our contemporary villain seemed to have 

386
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:17,704
merged the complexity and sometimes 
apparent innocence of nineties villains 

387
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,970
while broadening the social critiques of
the seventies and standing in opposition

388
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:25,804
to the nihilism of the two thousands.
They do believe that there's a cause 

389
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,780
worth fighting for,
and if they drafted different blueprints

390
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:32,614
for creating social change,
they might just resurface as complex 

391
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,544
heroes.
So what do you guys think are today's 

392
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:40,130
villains more interesting than past evil
doers?

393
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,060
And what do you think will come next for
Hollywood bad guts?
