00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:11,140
Jared here,
it may be the new year,

4
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:15,520
but we've still got a massive hangover 
from 2017 final blockbuster,

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,543
right?
A film that left us cross eyed and 

6
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:20,560
confused.
Netflix spent $90,

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,810
million dollars combining two of our 
favorite things,

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,703
the dystopian fantasy and the buddy cop 
and left us with the world's most 

9
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,084
expensive WTF.
We've been scratching our heads trying 

10
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:33,400
to figure out how such an awesome 
concept.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,263
Think rush hour too.
If the deathly hallows or lethal weapon 

12
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:40,630
of the rings ended up feeling as biggest
show as David Ayers last movie.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,770
Sorry,
I couldn't help it.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,783
Like other fantasy films,
it seems to be using it's imaginary 

15
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,054
setting to tell a compelling story while
also illuminating truths about our 

16
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:50,680
society.
However,

17
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,514
both its plot and any potential 
underlying meaning become completely 

18
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,840
muddled by the films.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,673
Poor world-building,
lousy character development and ill 

20
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,450
suited metaphors about American racial 
politics.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,810
So let's find out what happened in this 
week's [inaudible] condition on bright,

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,850
what went wrong,
and if you liked this sort of thing,

23
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,160
there's more where this came from in our
movie podcast.

24
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,130
Show me the meaning,
links in the description,

25
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,090
and be sure to check it out.
And as always,

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,953
major,
minor and vaguely judgmental spoilers 

27
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,490
ahead.
Headscratcher number one,

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,070
building the world.
Every time you see a film,

29
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,904
you're asked to take a leap of faith and
accept some kind of proposition that 

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,103
loving parents occasionally leave their 
youngest child behind when they go on 

31
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:32,380
vacation or that Keanu reeves is the 
most bad ass assassin ever.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,560
But when you're watching a fantasy that 
plays with gravity,

33
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,980
object permanence or the entertainment 
potential of a piece of furniture,

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,873
filmmakers have to convince you to take 
a mountain everest size leap off a peak 

35
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,600
of disbelief and land with their 
characters in a distant galaxy,

36
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,870
middle earth or a far away distant land 
inside a wardrobe.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,913
A good script gets the audience to buy 
into its world by explaining the rules 

38
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:58,330
of that world coherently and concisely 
and getting the heck on with the story.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,313
Think of how effective Lord of the rings
is in briefing the audience on the 

40
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,120
history of middle Earth's most sought 
after jewelry

41
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,300
with the forging of the great rings.
Three were given to the elks,

42
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,450
seven to the dwarf loads,
and nine,

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,750
nine rings were gifted to the race of 
men,

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,973
but they will,
all of them to see for another ring was 

45
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,630
made.
I'm mastering to control all others.

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,610
One ring to rule them all

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,190
with an origin story clocking in at six 
minutes.

48
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,024
That film situates US firmly in this 
complex world for it even leaner 

49
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:34,904
example,
consider star wars epic rolling title 

50
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,334
card that introduces you to an 
intergalactic space war in the time it 

51
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:40,814
takes to unwrap a candy bar.
Both films Orient the audience quickly 

52
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,400
and then they're off to the races.
Brights,

53
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,930
origin story.
On the other hand,

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,810
it's just plain messy to voltage and 
sloppy,

55
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:55,280
repetitive yet in complete fragments,
but before we analyze the world building

56
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:57,950
strategies,
a brief overview of the mythology behind

57
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:58,784
bright 2000 years ago,
something gnarly went down with a dark 

58
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,164
Lord.
All your excited with him except this 

59
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,474
one ORC Gerard,
who somehow united the nine races 

60
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,580
together and who are the nine races.
While it's not exactly clear,

61
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,750
we've got the elves,
humans or fairies and for the eagle eyed

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,560
viewers,
but anyway,

63
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,200
they managed to take down the dark lord 
except oops.

64
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,230
Ease ready to come back and all his 
demons,

65
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,970
Elvis need to do is bring three ones 
together.

66
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,043
Watch out though.
Only a bright can hold a one which 

67
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,330
creates complications still.
Even if the dark Ford does rise,

68
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,164
he can be stopped with magic.
That whole subplot never comes to 

69
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,074
fruition though.
Probably to be saved for the recently 

70
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,090
greenlit sequel that will hopefully come
with some clarification now.

71
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,924
It's totally understandable that the 
minds behind Brian wanted to veer away 

72
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:44,050
from the dramatically narrated storybook
style opener of Lord of the rings.

73
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,063
It's not exactly the freshest turf in 
the screen writing world or it would be 

74
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,294
understandable if bright hadn't started 
out with an equally cheesy but less 

75
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:52,984
eloquent quote.
That sounds like it came out of a 10 

76
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,470
year old's dungeons and dragons game.
From there,

77
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,200
they have an opening sequence of 
cringeworthy tagging.

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,273
You would think with $90,000,000
they can afford to hire a decent la 

79
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,250
graffiti artists.

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,650
Through this we learned there's 
interspecies upheaval,

81
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:09,130
police brutality and lizard people 
roaming the streets.

82
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,063
You know,
it's pretty rude to tease the existence 

83
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,900
of Lizard people and not the liver,
but I digress.

84
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,650
These shots of the street explained some
atmospheric aspects of the film's world,

85
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,020
but we're still missing the cold hard 
facts.

86
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,973
For instance,
who is the dark lord and what did he do 

87
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,110
and why are all the social media 
influencers,

88
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:26,944
elves.
We weren't the only people scratching 

89
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,230
our heads either after fans expressed 
widespread confusion as to what the heck

90
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,030
was going on with all this dark lord 
stuff.

91
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,923
Netflix released what amounted to a two 
minute instruction manual for the film 

92
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,753
and it's we're given a few thousand 
years of magical history with factual 

93
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,890
nuggets like Jurek was hailed as the 
first,

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,150
but if Dirac saved everyone,
why do people hate orange so damn much?

95
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,490
And how did this world social order come
about?

96
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,683
This video feels more like a hastily 
concocted admission of guilt that this 

97
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,314
film was confusing as hell.
Another world building issue is the way 

98
00:04:59,021 --> 00:04:59,854
the film conveys the limited information
it does tell the audience which brings 

99
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,040
us to a fundamental screen writing rule 
showing versus telling.

100
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,130
Showing is when a film conveys 
information through characters.

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,580
Actions telling is when characters chat 
about the events of the world,

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,520
the narrative equivalent of an Intel 
briefing for the audience,

103
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,563
and boy is bright a telephone for route.
The film characters regularly serve as 

104
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:21,574
embedded narrators,
a strategy that swallows the action and 

105
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,470
create stiff,
unrealistic dialogue.

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,513
For instance,
the award for worst line in the film 

107
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,930
goes to wards daughter in this cringy.

108
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,930
Everybody hates please.

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,110
Okay,
we get it.

110
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,590
Another prime example comes from ward 
early on.

111
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,740
Hey,
look,

112
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,830
I got to do to my car.
The whole world is watching.

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,080
All right.
I didn't ask for it.

114
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,260
I don't want it,
but I don't get a vote.

115
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,263
First of all,
this speech is stupendously heavy 

116
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,510
handed.
Nobody talks like this.

117
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,403
Secondly,
these facts can be shown in a natural 

118
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,730
way through the narrative.
In fact,

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,573
Ward makes it pretty clear he'd rather 
be done by a ferry than right to work 

120
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,630
alongside Jacoby,

121
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,890
so I'm in a phase where he just shut up.
Don't say anything,

122
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,450
just draw out a word.

123
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,933
Still.
The winner for the most forest proxy 

124
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:14,574
narrator has to be the smelly sword.
Wielding bum who goes from trying to 

125
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:20,490
Samurai,
a crowd of people to calmly relaying the

126
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:23,290
entire world's backstory without even a 
shower break.

127
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Nine races shoulder to shoulder to give 
you the world you neglect the.

128
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:29,834
Now,
the dark one returned to reclaim our 

129
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:35,550
carts.
Then as the feds interrogate him,

130
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:39,540
he gives a plotting explanation of the 
shield of light in Fernie wands.

131
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,374
The dark Lord Layla Tika,
and write this scene is a boring and b 

132
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,743
doesn't make sense unless you assume 
federal agents in charge of magic crime 

133
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,950
are Asfa confused by the rules of their 
world as we are.

134
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,880
This strategy continues throughout the 
film wants to and ward,

135
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,550
find the magic one and call for backup 
for skeezy.

136
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:03,840
Cops show up and give us another forced 
lecture on how magic works.

137
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,840
That's magic right there.
That's whatever you want.

138
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,150
You want a million dollars,
10 million,

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,860
you want to be taller or shorter,
make it bigger.

140
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,743
You want to go back in time and marry 
the girl who didn't blow you on prom 

141
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,260
night.
That's how you do it right there.

142
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,223
They continue to narrate the plot as it.
The audience would be absolutely 

143
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,820
flummoxed by the concept of dirty cops,
so it's thrilling.

144
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,630
Two cops die tonight.

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,530
It's clearly done for the audience's 
sake and it's Corny as hell.

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,513
The scripts spooned feeds us.
Huge plot points and small details 

147
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,710
alike.
Like when Ward Jacobian Tika are fleeing

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,200
the Mexican gang and ward yells,
windows up.

149
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,350
Bulletproof.
Is he patronizing Jacoby or the audience

150
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,840
who even knows just for fun,
they remind us.

151
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,050
Needless Exposition,
head.

152
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,093
Sometimes this tire,
some exposition manages to somehow be 

153
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,680
both forced and and complete.
For instance,

154
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:05,480
Jacoby gives a snooze inducing and 
scattered explanation of his orchid idle

155
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,950
Jeruk chemos who changed the world.
Okay.

156
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,540
And

157
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,250
they raised their place to him.
He was flooded in that very moment.

158
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,270
Okay,
so Dirac was a former farmer who was.

159
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,230
Wait,
what was that?

160
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,663
Flooded

161
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,040
in that very moment.

162
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,121
Okay.
Seriously,

163
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,680
what is the deal with this flooding 
thing?

164
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,523
He's out.
He's like a finger that got cut off the 

165
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:31,660
hand.
He's dead to us.

166
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,080
Jacoby who is not flooded explains that.
It's a sign of honor in the community.

167
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,173
What you did tonight.
That's what it takes for an org to get 

168
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,520
blooded,
an active,

169
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,560
great bravery.

170
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,543
So are we supposed to think that all 
these other orcs are brave except 

171
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,620
Jacoby,
the one who professionally puts his life

172
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,990
in harm's way and what does blooding 
even mean?

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,580
Jacoby sad dental situation as compared 
to his brother and it's definitely tooth

174
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,414
related.
We finally get a peek at this blooding 

175
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,754
ritual at the end of the film after 
Jacoby Saves Ward and the same orcs who 

176
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,804
only half an hour ago killed him slip 
their palms because apparently clan 

177
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,600
loyalty means never having to say you're
sorry.

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,950
Hey,
least that's showing,

179
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,570
not telling.
So Goldstar.

180
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,733
If only we understood what the heck is 
going on or how this crowd of orcs knew 

181
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,810
that Jacobi had just committed an act of
bravery.

182
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,913
Is there some kind of work bat signal?
Are they just following Jacoby all 

183
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,970
night,
waiting to shed blood,

184
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:27,540
which would magically give jacoby the 
perfect or smile on the bright side.

185
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,910
The next day.
Jacoby does appear to be teething on his

186
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:32,820
new fangs moving onto head scratcher.
Number two,

187
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,180
hero Shamiro.
Whether you're writing about outer space

188
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:39,120
downtown Baltimore or a wizarding school
in an English castle,

189
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,150
the first ingredient of a good story is 
a hero or two or three in bright.

190
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,294
We have ward and Jacoby and neither will
undergo significant character 

191
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,464
development over the course of the film.
Ward begins the film as a snarky 

192
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:52,710
dickhead.

193
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,270
Well,
if you in a box,

194
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,590
I'll probably be like more song

195
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,280
and ends the film as a snarky dickhead 
dog.

196
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,520
Now you blooded,
Huh?

197
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,503
Jacoby begins as a toothless,
insecure guy who can't stand up for 

198
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:07,774
himself.

199
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,473
Hold.

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,770
Can you make a shootout?

201
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,030
Awkward.
Sorry.

202
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,013
And ends.
The film has a slightly tooth guy who 

203
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,680
ward still treats like a tattooed 
forrest gump thing.

204
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,500
The nice federal agents.

205
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,470
Thank you.

206
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,303
Beyond that,
for a film centered on an unlikely 

207
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:28,404
friendship,
their relationship also seems pretty 

208
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,620
stagnant.
At best,

209
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,490
it could be said that ward learns to 
tolerate Jacobi and not narc on him,

210
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,040
which is pretty bleak as far as buddy 
films go.

211
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,353
It's not surprising.
They never changed because they never 

212
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,750
really had character journeys to begin 
with.

213
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,753
He number one rule in making a 
compelling hero according to Aaron 

214
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,110
Sorkin,
is that somebody's gotta want something.

215
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,480
Something's got to be standing in the 
way of getting it.

216
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,463
You do that and you have a seat.
Eventually you'll have a movie to 

217
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,333
Westley wants Princess Buttercup,
Ferris bueller wants to cut class and 

218
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,634
party and so on and bright,
not so much or doesn't appear to 

219
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,194
actively want anything except maybe to 
lose Jacoby as his partner and keep his 

220
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:08,784
job without being a corrupt asshole.
That said he doesn't pursue those goals 

221
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,320
in any meaningful way.

222
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,380
Jacoby does want to be blooded,
but as explained earlier,

223
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,333
we don't really understand what the heck
being blooded is or what it means for 

224
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,234
him as a character.
Does he have to submit the clan loyalty 

225
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,380
to hang out with those Miami orcs?
I mean,

226
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,030
they seemed fun.
While a,

227
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:27,864
what makes a hero initially compelling 
the heroes choices or what makes it 

228
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,154
characters stay compelling,
apparently Dustin Hoffman won't even 

229
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,664
sign onto a movie unless his character 
has no less than 40 points of choice in 

230
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,370
the script.
Rather than 40 points of choice,

231
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,293
our main guy's face approximately 40 
points of coincidence that saved their 

232
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,164
butts.
Such a coincidence is called a deus ex 

233
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:48,804
machina or a person or thing that 
appears suddenly and provides a 

234
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:54,970
contrived solution to and apparently 
insoluble difficulty.

235
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,240
Most notable among these is the one in 
one instance,

236
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,900
the wan solves the inconvenience of 
Jacoby dying in another awards,

237
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:02,734
totally random status as a bright turns,
what would have been an act of suicide 

238
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,940
into a semi heroic,
a 100 percent coincidental fee.

239
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,250
Now for a head scratcher.
Number three,

240
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,203
when a metaphor is a train wreck,
bright is littered with unsubtle 

241
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:17,704
metaphors comparing interspecies 
discrimination with real world racial 

242
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,054
discrimination.
Even chance the rapper are called the 

243
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,250
metaphor a little shallow.
We more than a little degree,

244
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,950
but before we take a deep dive into the 
meanings at play,

245
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,840
we want to give the following.
Disclaimer,

246
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,763
yes,
this is a fictional world in which nine 

247
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,720
races coexist with varying levels of 
friction.

248
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,703
Maybe the filmmakers had no intention of
it being read as a precise metaphor for 

249
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,754
American racial politics.
Problem is the movie practically begs 

250
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:46,594
you to draw this comparison.
Where's the diversity hire you ride 

251
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,200
with?
First off,

252
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,093
it's a film about cops set in La,
a city that was home to one of the 

253
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,874
country's most violent race riots ever.
One which was specifically ignited by 

254
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:00,940
police violence towards black folks.
Bright,

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,770
very deliberately draws comparisons 
between orcs and black Americans in ways

256
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:09,350
that are too obvious to ignore from the 
graffiti to the urban street,

257
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:10,184
wear visual adaptations of black culture
about their marginalized by other races 

258
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,124
in society and face victimization at the
hands of the police in truly 

259
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,264
sophisticated symbolism.
The films that just the cops would 

260
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,840
definitely kill the hooded or

261
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,560
and the troops are coming up.
Humans with gone looking for new.

262
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,810
Who shot a cop.
You pick that kid had a chance

263
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,530
just for fun.
One ORC tells Jacoby your buddies,

264
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:34,364
so happy to say he's got an ORC friend.
Not knowing that ward very dramatically 

265
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,240
doesn't do friends.
You don't want me as a friend.

266
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,560
Oh Jeez,
dude,

267
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,453
save it for your art therapist.
That metaphor is referenced most 

268
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,940
disturbingly when Jacoby is hung by a 
rope during a fight scene with an Elf.

269
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,013
I don't need to spell out why.
Putting a character that has been 

270
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,660
signified as black in this situation is 
more than a little messed up.

271
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,823
Oh,
and one very important distinction 

272
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,044
between ORCS and black Americans.
ORCS apparently caused their oppression 

273
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,610
or at least their great,
great,

274
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,444
great,
great grand daddies did when they 

275
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:11,250
decided to side with the dark Lord Lord,
a long time ago,

276
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,670
and navient paid for it ever since.
Needless to say,

277
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,280
real racial prejudice does not work that
way.

278
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,490
I eat black Americans have zero sins to 
pay for.

279
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,470
When you're making a metaphor about 
race,

280
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,363
it's important to be very,
very precise because there's a real 

281
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:25,994
danger that an ill conceived metaphor 
can muddle an already complicated 

282
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,104
conversation to understand why.
Let's examine the cognitive function of 

283
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,990
metaphors in there.
Influential book metaphors.

284
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:39,530
We live by scholars,
George Lakoff and Mark Johnson explained

285
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:43,460
that metaphors are vital to human beings
understanding of the world around us.

286
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,443
That's because metaphors are a way of 
taking a human's understanding of a 

287
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:47,804
simple,
often physically tangible concept and 

288
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:52,130
transferring that understanding onto 
another poor,

289
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:52,964
complicated concept,
often one hidden from our senses or 

290
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,830
difficult to explain,
play golf and Johnson.

291
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,870
Are you then when we make a metaphor,
say,

292
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:00,704
comparing madness to love.
We're not just momentarily linking to 

293
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:04,364
ideas.
We're also transferring an extensive 

294
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,274
array of our cognitive associations 
about what constitutes madness onto 

295
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,690
love.
As a result,

296
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,524
a human struggling to write a Valentine 
card can explain why they have 

297
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,730
butterflies in their belly.

298
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,850
As a result,
metaphors may create realities for us,

299
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,900
especially social realities leading us 
to view the metaphor as being true.

300
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,120
So in this case,
lovers be cray.

301
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,730
So what does all this have to do with 
fictional orcs?

302
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,653
When a film like bright unsubtly evokes 
a metaphor that transfers the viewer's 

303
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:36,680
understanding of the inhuman orcs onto 
black Americans,

304
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,663
they inherently invite the possibility 
that viewers will transfer all their 

305
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,190
cognitive associations about what 
constitutes orcs,

306
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,350
a race of homogenous,
inarticulate,

307
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:49,910
tattooed gangsters onto that of the 
extremely complex and most importantly,

308
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:50,744
human group of black Americans.
It's not like bright is going to 

309
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:54,314
radically harm race relations,
but this practice does place it 

310
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:57,464
somewhere in an ugly history of American
cinema comparing people of color to 

311
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,320
inhuman creatures.
Before we go further into this,

312
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,200
it's important to address the colorblind
elephant in the room.

313
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,153
Bright depicts a world where a black man
of wards status can exist seemingly 

314
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:13,550
without facing bigotry or to quote 
chance the rapper.

315
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,533
Racism has gone because we hate ORC.
Now that's messed up more so even when 

316
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,870
you couple it with wards,
treatment of marginalized creatures,

317
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,230
all of which have OIC treatment of black
Americans by police officers.

318
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,760
Whether he's saying very lives don't 
matter today or watching a bunch of orcs

319
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:32,560
get beat up.
Then asking Jacoby Your Cup first.

320
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,533
It just feels odd in a country where 
violence against black men by police 

321
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:39,734
officers remains heartbreakingly common 
depicting a black cop this way just 

322
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,830
feels way,
way off the mark wards.

323
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:46,664
Character seems to be there to both 
protect the film against charges of 

324
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,054
racism because how can a movie be racist
when it shows a black man as equal and 

325
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,344
even getting to be racist himself and 
make a backwards argument about how far 

326
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,430
black America has come through an 
individual representation of a black man

327
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,264
who's made it and earned respect.
Now back to the specifics of the films 

328
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,150
depiction of Orcs,
which makes it even more.

329
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,900
While Jacoby is an honorable guy with a 
working moral compass.

330
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,620
His depiction is not particularly 
flattering for starters,

331
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,250
and there's no easy way to say this.
Jacoby is not the sharpest,

332
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,563
most painfully obvious near the end of 
the film would Jacobi cannot stop 

333
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:26,750
spilling incriminating evidence to the 
two federal agents turn turned around,

334
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,923
just rocked the film.
Doesn't make it better when ward tells 

335
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:35,990
his daughter.
All of the races are different.

336
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,943
While there is something to be said for 
respecting ethnic and cultural 

337
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:39,854
differences,
wards comments seemed to suggest the 

338
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:45,840
existence of actual biological racial 
differences to have mad,

339
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,113
Huh?

340
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,850
Excuse me.
Her,

341
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,010
the

342
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,320
detective.
How many dogs play pro basketball?

343
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,970
None.
They're slow.

344
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:56,370
They're heavy.
That's why half the NFL defensive lines.

345
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,470
It's not racist to physics.

346
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,693
Yes,
they're fictional characters who are 

347
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:01,344
literally have different species,
but the metaphor is still evokes black 

348
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:04,614
Americans and it feels plain weird.
That coupled with Jacoby's clear 

349
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,054
inability to match words,
intellect which falls into the trap of 

350
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,204
evoking hundreds of years of junk,
racist biology that tried to excuse 

351
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:19,140
racism on the grounds that people of 
color were intellectually inferior.

352
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,123
At the same time giving orcs,
they super strong sense of smell gives 

353
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,424
them an animalistic quality.
That again makes the metaphor super 

354
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,114
ugly,
particularly when you consider the 

355
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:28,914
hundreds of years of white Americans 
treating black Americans like sub human 

356
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:34,550
beings as lakoff and Johnson explained 
what is it?

357
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,470
Issue is not the truth or falsity of a 
metaphor,

358
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,423
but the perceptions and inferences that 
follow from it and the actions that are 

359
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,144
sanctioned by it.
Metaphors like the one in bright in 

360
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,354
comparing people of color to in human 
beings are up even if they had good 

361
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,720
intentions and as lake often Johnson 
explained,

362
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,460
we define our reality in terms of 
metaphors and then proceed to act though

363
00:18:56,461 --> 00:19:00,120
it makes some superficial points about 
tolerance and encourages the audience to

364
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,880
empathize with Jacoby's experience of 
marginalization,

365
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,860
abusive friendships and kick me signs.

366
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,210
Brights overarching metaphor is just 
plain sloppy brights.

367
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,044
Let us down,
but given our world of inevitable 

368
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,230
sequels,
prequels,

369
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:16,530
three goals and squeak walls,
we suspect elves and orcs.

370
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,610
We'll be duking it out on your favorite 
streaming platform for years to come and

371
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:21,444
we're not mad at it.
Netflix has a cool concept to work with 

372
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,713
and in case you haven't heard a 
disgusting amount of dough to throw at 

373
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:28,554
it.
So here's to hoping the cql gives us 

374
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:31,830
something special.
Thanks for watching.

375
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,080
Everybody pays.
