00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,800
Hey,
wise crack corporeal.

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,140
Jared here on the set of earthling 
cinema,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,740
so we just saw star wars,
the last Jedi and seems like it's pretty

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:19,020
divisive.
While the critics seem to love it,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,883
it's one of the least liked star wars 
movies by audience reviews and the wise 

8
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:23,804
crack team is similarly divided,
but regardless of whether you loved it 

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,414
or hated it,
it's hard to deny that the movie took 

10
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,054
some big interesting risks.
It deliberately plays with our 

11
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,400
expectations of what a star wars movie 
is.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,000
Rethinks the eternal battle between 
light and dark and questions.

13
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:39,834
The efficacy of heroics.
Welcome is wisecrack quick take on the 

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,000
last Jedi and for the love of God,
spoilers ahead.

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,834
If you haven't seen it,
go watch it and come back the last July 

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,710
puts forth two major ideas.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,420
One,
let go of the past.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,550
Kill it.
If you have to end to.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,980
Don't be a hero.
Preserve the light.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,400
So let's break down the first one.
Should we let the past die?

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,730
Raise whole reason for seeking out luke,
in addition to getting him to join,

22
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,970
the resistance is to get answers about 
her powers and her parents.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,833
Rose holds onto a family heirloom that's
reminder of her deceased sister and 

24
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,764
Leah.
After the murder of Han Solo is 

25
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,040
struggling to hold onto the memory of 
her son.

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,800
Other characters try to outright reject 
their past.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,783
Luke renounces.
The Jetta convinced that the force is 

28
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,574
about balance,
not a bunch of dudes with laser sticks 

29
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:25,140
convinced that they're the arbiters of 
that ballads,

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
even decides to burn the temple,
and the foundational texts within luke 

31
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:30,144
also rejects his legacy.
The legends of Luke Skywalker rose is 

32
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,630
compelled to part with her past by 
giving away her precious family.

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,463
Ambulant Kylo Ren is killing off the 
memory of Ben Solo and he also urges 

34
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,364
rate to forget about who her parents are
or his own lineage and join him in a 

35
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,640
galaxy.
We're home.

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,370
Planets have a tendency to get blowed 
up.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,413
It's not bad advice,
but ultimately the film projects this 

38
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,820
message reasserting the importance of 
embracing the past.

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,400
Even though Lucan Yoda burned down the 
Gi temple,

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,353
turns out Ray has those foundational 
texts still safely stashed in her 

41
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,560
belongings.
Luca firms,

42
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,394
he won't be the last Jedi,
and rose eventually gets her pendant 

43
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,390
back,
but most importantly,

44
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,320
luke revives the legend of Luke 
Skywalker when he confronts Kylo Ren,

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,050
but more on that later,
now onto the next lesson.

46
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,590
Don't be a hero preserved the light or 
more specifically,

47
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:17,424
if being a hero means yelling,
Leroy Jenkins in the face of 

48
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,480
insurmountable odds,
then don't do that.

49
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,343
This is embodied by Poe who disobeyed 
his orders and gets a bunch of people 

50
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:25,794
killed and taking down a dreadnought and
Finn who goes on a suicide mission to 

51
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,540
destroy the battering Ram Canon.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,660
The whole point of this is to say,
when things are so dismal,

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,523
the battle can't be about winning.
The best we can do is preserve the 

54
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:38,604
light.
This is decidedly a different attitude 

55
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,700
than other star wars films which 
characterize the day being saved by Jed.

56
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,900
I'm hopping and swings and blowing stuff
up,

57
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,360
but with Vice Admiral,
oh,

58
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,530
skepticism of Po,
the last jet,

59
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:53,460
I takes a new approach.
Fin suicide charges interrupted by roads

60
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:57,030
who tells them that at this stage it's 
not about defeating the enemy so much as

61
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:57,864
protecting what you love,
except that's exactly what Finn was 

62
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,430
trying to do and after admonishing po 
for the entire film,

63
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,570
Vice Admiral,
Oh,

64
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,413
saves the transport ships by sacrificing
herself and ramming the first order 

65
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,280
cruiser more or less what Finn tried,
but in space.

66
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,930
So what the hell?
Star Wars.

67
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,610
By the way,
if you want to hear more of that kind of

68
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,444
fan rage,
check out our last episode of our movie 

69
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,490
podcast.

70
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,323
Show me the meaning.
It's available wherever you get your 

71
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,430
podcasts.
Anyway,

72
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,264
it's in Luke's arc in which we see these
two themes of the past and heroism 

73
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,194
collide in a really interesting way.
Most of the movies shows luke 

74
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,420
incessantly refusing to get off his ass 
and join.

75
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,254
The rebellion is even confronted with 
the exact same call to adventure as 

76
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,680
episode four,
which he also initially refused,

77
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,523
but this time he refuses for like two 
hours precedent joining up with the 

78
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,770
cause like he did an episode four.
He does something else.

79
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,100
He projects his image to the rebel 
holdout echoing roses,

80
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:48,934
words he's not here to defeat the enemy,
but to preserve the light by saving his 

81
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,344
sister and stalling the first order.
He projects his image and dies from the 

82
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,244
tremendous energy the feet requires,
but why didn't he just go in person and 

83
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:05,620
kill Kylo or at the very least,
let Kylo strike him down all our ob one,

84
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,020
because the galaxy doesn't need a hero.

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,890
They need a symbol.
While layers call for assistance fell on

86
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,010
deaf ears.
The final scene of the film details poor

87
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:15,844
exploited children of Canto bight 
retelling the story of Luke skywalker 

88
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,060
surviving the impossible barrage of 
fire.

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,810
This is where Luke comes to accept his 
legacy and his past.

90
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,673
This revitalized legends of Luke 
Skywalker will inspire more people to 

91
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,650
join the resistance.
Then layers cries for help.

92
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,100
Luke Skywalker as a symbol will do more 
for the resistance.

93
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,530
Then Luke Skywalker,
the man ever could.

94
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,630
There's another reason I find this 
really interesting.

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,673
The original star wars was heavily 
inspired by Classic Westerns with its 

96
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,980
ensemble of outlaws and the lawlessness 
of open space,

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,873
and in that tradition,
Johnson takes an idea that we see in 

98
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,874
classic Westerns like the man who shot 
liberty valance and Fort Apache in both 

99
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,960
films and undeserving character is 
enshrined in legend for the greater good

100
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,794
of the West and the man who shot liberty
balance the false narrative that the 

101
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,274
idealistic ransom stoddard killed the 
seemingly unkillable liberty valance 

102
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,640
brings order to the west and in Fort 
Apache,

103
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,474
the lie that captain Thursday died,
a noble hero enables the US military to 

104
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,870
continue its duty.
He must have been a great name,

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,370
great.
Norman died more gallantly.

106
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,910
Luke skywalker may not have been the 
hero people thought he was,

107
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,630
but belie created around his epic last 
stand.

108
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,653
We'll go on to spark the next wave of 
resistance in a quote that equally 

109
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:34,734
describes all three movies.
A reporter in the man who shot liberty 

110
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,190
balance,
proclaims,

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,570
and the legend becomes fact.
Print the legend the last July even uses

112
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:44,880
the western tropes of a retired 
Gunslinger,

113
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,640
hesitant to enter back into the world of
violence.

114
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,563
Now,
if you'll allow us to get Meta for a 

115
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,184
second,
there's another way of thinking about 

116
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,134
all this.
The force awakens in dealing with its 

117
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,210
own past decided to make a more or less 
scene for scene remake,

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,690
a new hope,
but unlike Jj Abrams,

119
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,040
writer,
director Ryan Johnson,

120
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:01,874
did something much different.
Johnson took the fundamental building 

121
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:05,414
blocks of star wars for saw audience 
expectations and deliberately subverted 

122
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,670
them every step of the way.

123
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,593
In many ways,
the last jet is similar to the empire 

124
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,294
strikes back a wannabe jet.
I traveled to an isolated planet to be 

125
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,950
trained,
ignores their masters advice,

126
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,784
then finds out who their parents are,
even swapped out billy dee Williams for 

127
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,620
Bco del Toro,
betrayal and all.

128
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,740
However,
in the last jet,

129
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:29,750
I are mentor refuses to help and raise.
Parents aren't legendary Jetta.

130
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:34,751
I bought junkers who sold her for booze,
money and snow just dies with no fleshed

131
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,880
out backstory.
When I first saw the gaping dark hole in

132
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,900
the last jet,
I was like,

133
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,430
oh,
this looks familiar,

134
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,520
but unlike Luke,
Rey finds nothing there.

135
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,460
It was a deliberate misdirect.
And finally,

136
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,200
and I'm still a little unsure about 
this,

137
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,350
the powdery white base is pretty much 
the same as hoth,

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,193
but covered in salt instead of snow.
I was a little confused as to be very 

139
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,310
deliberate proclamation that the white 
powder was salt.

140
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,830
But here's what I've got salting the 
earth.

141
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,370
In ancient history,
salting land was a way to curse the land

142
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:05,204
and prevent anything from being built on
top of it as salt is toxic to crops is 

143
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,750
Johnson salting the earth of Star Wars 
Lore.

144
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:15,020
By redefining the resistance and what it
means to be a hero.

145
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,943
Also,
unlike the original trilogy which finds 

146
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:21,200
its heroes and princesses and people 
with quote unquote noble blood,

147
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,560
the last Jedi Knight does a lot of work 
to move away from this narrative.

148
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,440
Our heroes are fin,
a janitor rose,

149
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,080
a pipe mechanic,
and ray,

150
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,033
who we learn is not the descendant of a 
powerful family lineage like the 

151
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,260
Skywalker's but junkers.
And unlike the rest of the film,

152
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,630
which seemingly argues for preserving 
the past,

153
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,673
the last gi is moving away from the 
narrative model that defined its 

154
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,394
predecessors.
So what do you think wise crack was the 

155
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,004
last jet,
a cinematic masterpiece or a medic 

156
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,084
laurian dumpster fire also will be doing
an ama for the first hour of this video 

157
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:52,460
gets released.

158
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,920
We'll have a pinned comment or you can 
ask us about star wars,

159
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,350
how we work,
my favorite Korean barbecue restaurant.

160
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,780
My dog would eat or anything else you 
want to know?

161
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,913
As always,
thank you so much for watching guys 

162
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,193
piece the last shit.
I's amazing story wouldn't have been 

163
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,690
possible without the technology needed 
to power it.

164
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,703
In that same vein,
Intel is paving the way for emotional 

165
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,340
stories in virtual reality dedicated to 
innovation and technology and content.

166
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,100
Intel is supporting the vr film Pale 
Blue Dot,

167
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,970
allowing audiences to explore their way 
through deep space where earth is just a

168
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,804
speck in the cosmos.
Inspired by the iconic Pale blue dot 

169
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,134
photograph.
The film brings other worlds to life 

170
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,200
with visual effects,
sound design,

171
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,034
and an original score under the 
direction of indie filmmaker Eliza 

172
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,484
mcnitt.
The film is part of Intel's commitment 

173
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,410
to empower vr filmmakers and as huge 
Scifi nerds.

174
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,500
We love this.
While the film premieres in early 2018,

175
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,440
you can catch every episode of the 
making of the Pale blue dot,

176
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,690
the behind the scenes miniseries right 
now.

177
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,733
The series offers key snapshots of 
beignets journey with her fellow 

178
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,670
filmmakers.
In this new medium,

179
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,713
we learned firsthand what it takes to 
create a vr experience and how to 

180
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,234
immersive you were in a story when the 
audience has control over what they see 

181
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,853
a wisecrack.
We're constantly analyzing the ways we 

182
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,224
experience stories and we couldn't be 
more excited to see how vr filmmaking 

183
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,883
shapes the way stories are told.
