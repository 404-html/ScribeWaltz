1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,540
There are a lot of factors that make 
Florida weird.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,783
It is not like any other state that I 
know of in the sense that there is no 

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,640
Florida.
I mean,

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,780
there is Miami where I live,
which is Latin America.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,260
Um,
there,

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,090
I mean,
it is.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,420
I mean,
you spend anytime in way Emma,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,470
you will discover that not only is it 
Latin America,

9
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:30,480
but it's more and more Latin America 
every day.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,330
Uh,
if you go south into the keys,

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,990
it's the sixties.
If you go west to Naples,

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,850
it's Ohio.
Uh,

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,730
if you go north to boca,
it's long island.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,060
If you go to Orlando,
it's like a,

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,710
you know,
Russian limousine drivers driving,

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,683
you know,
tourists from everywhere in the world 

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,540
all around.
And if you go much north of that,

18
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,330
it becomes Georgia and Alabama.
So it is really not.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,190
One state has no coherence at all.
Um,

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,960
and I think less so as the time goes by.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,813
It's a vacation spot.
So you have people coming down there 

22
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,154
just to have fun.
A few people who are not feeling it 

23
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,660
necessarily in a serious mood.
You have,

24
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,510
it's a very transient state.
So you have a lot of people,

25
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,320
again,
who don't,

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,153
don't feel rooted there but are just 
there because it's convenient or the 

27
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,610
weather's nice or whatever.
Uh,

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,160
and it's,
it's,

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,170
it's an,
it's a pretty corrupt state.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,980
Governments,
we've had a lot of corruption in Florida

31
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,760
and um,
and it's convenient to uh,

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,090
you know,
all kinds of borders.

33
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,700
So it's very easy to get there from the 
Caribbean,

34
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,750
from Latin America,
whatever.

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,500
So if you wanted to smuggle something in
Florida is a great place to start.

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,843
So the result of this is it's just kind 
of this very loose during non 

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,510
structured,
very nontraditional state where anything

38
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,344
feels like it could happen.
It's kind of like if you made Las Vegas 

39
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,630
much bigger and with less controls,
you know,

40
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,523
not,
not the efficiency of the casinos and 

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,053
the Las Vegas police department,
just as kind of a big area where people 

42
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,010
feel they can do things.

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,180
And so people come from everywhere to,
to party to do whatever to do,

44
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,810
commit to commit criminal acts.
And it's the weather's warm.

45
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,740
So you can always be outside and you 
know,

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,050
there's always a party going on 
somewhere.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,110
It's just conducive to weird things 
happening.

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,050
My argument has been for a long time 
that we are not,

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,453
it's not so much floridians who are 
weird and I consider myself when I've 

50
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,510
been there 30 years.
Uh,

51
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,340
it's,
it's people come to Florida.

52
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,400
We are like the Ellis Island for weird,
stupid people.

53
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,070
They come to come to Florida to commit 
stupid acts.

54
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:35,970
If,
if,

55
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,950
um,
one example I like to use,

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,540
you know,
they've got an international,

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,560
a publicity woman was arrested driving 
south on the overseas highway from Miami

58
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,590
to key to key west a,
b,

59
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,020
she had an accident,
um,

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,280
because she was shaving her bikini 
region while a while driving.

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,143
Well,
she actually had an outsourced the 

62
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,310
steering to her,
her passenger.

63
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,010
She was in a hurry to see her boyfriend 
in key west.

64
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,540
This is all according to the police 
report.

65
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,883
Um,
so she said he'd rather than pull over 

66
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,650
to the side of the road to shave her 
bikini region,

67
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,800
she keep going and outsource the,
uh,

68
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,570
steering to a passenger who was,
as it happened.

69
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,030
And this is where it's a Florida story,
her ex husband.

70
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,050
So they're,
they're driving south 40 miles an hour,

71
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,060
she's shaving,
but not looking at the road,

72
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,920
just operating,
accelerate your steering into what could

73
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,590
possibly go wrong.
Uh,

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,280
anyway,
the car in front of them slows down,

75
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,143
they slam into it is an accident,
international news or they don't get as 

76
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,720
all Florida stories are,
you know,

77
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,750
oh,
can you believe it?

78
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,584
This woman,
is she shaving her bikini area while 

79
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,480
driving to,
you know,

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,450
the woman was from Indiana.

81
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,450
That's the key.
So he was shaving her hoosier.

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,130
Um,
so,

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,100
which is I think with that term,
but we,

84
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,760
Florida gets the blame for that,
but it's actually,

85
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,620
you know,
it's,

86
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,250
it's somebody who came to Florida and 
that's so often the case.

87
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,084
If somebody decides he wants to pleasure
himself into a stuffed animal in 

88
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,254
Walmart,
that person's going to come wherever he 

89
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,624
is.
He's going to go to Florida to commit 

90
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,510
that act.
And you know,

91
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,803
this is why we have so many people doing
just so many weird things naked with 

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,760
love reptiles.
We have a lot of reptiles also.

93
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,703
So.
