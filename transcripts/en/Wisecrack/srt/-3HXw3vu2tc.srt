1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,330
You know,
I,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,910
I knew a guy

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,763
who was a bartender in Washington named 
Steve Daley and I found myself covering 

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,743
Wimbledon with him because I was a 
sports writer for two years at the 

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,043
Washington Post because that's the job 
that they had open after my being a 

6
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,730
police report.
And I said,

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,760
how did you get from being a bartender 
to a columnist for the Chicago Tribune?

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,403
He said,
well,

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,070
I used to be a funny bartender and they,
you know,

10
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,450
the sports editors will come and they 
said,

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:40,670
you ought to try writing a column.
And he did it and then he did it again.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,533
He did it again and he got this job.
So what happens when you become a big 

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,800
shot editor or a big shot columnists,
sooner or later,

14
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,634
people ask you questions like this.
What advice do you have for young 

15
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,630
journalists?
And unfortunately,

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,610
if you're honest,
you have to say,

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,770
number one,
get real lucky,

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,443
but number two,
and maybe more important than number 

19
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:07,690
one,
is to work like a nut.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,233
To work really,
really hard and to learn as much as you 

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,503
can and to hope that you have some 
talent almost equal to or equal to your 

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,720
sense of effort,
because I have to tell you,

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,563
as an editor,
what always impresses me are the people 

24
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:31,171
who are obsessed,
people who are gifted perhaps,

25
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:33,574
but I'm obsessed and they can't even 
imagine themselves doing anything other 

26
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,444
than a political covering the political 
campaign or writing about the war in 

27
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:48,780
Iraq or Afghanistan or for that matter,
uh,

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,713
writing fiction at the level of an Alice
Munro or George Saunders or whoever you 

29
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,893
happen to.
Like those people invariably do it all 

30
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,634
the time.
And with a sense of passion and 

31
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,570
obsession that makes them as successful 
as they are.
