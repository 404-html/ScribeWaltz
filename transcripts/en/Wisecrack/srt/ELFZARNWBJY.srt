00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,253
Jared here today we're talking about the
show that launched a thousand Halloween 

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,970
costumes.
Stranger things,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,923
pretty much every 20 something with a 
borrowed Netflix password is losing 

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:16,644
their mind over season two but why is 
everyone so obsessed with a show that's 

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:24,520
basically the goonies meet Fox mulder,
some may Pinot on the stall chip,

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,110
but I'm going to argue it has a lot to 
do with toys,

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,123
whether it's kids becoming the rulers of
a nation by engaging in literal warfare 

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,250
or an animated baby in a suit doing 
espionage,

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,203
TV and movies about powerful children 
tend to age them up in order to 

11
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,270
demonstrate their abilities rather than 
taking seriously.

12
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:46,104
The potential of childhood.
Childhood is either something to be 

13
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:52,290
overcome or just comic juxtaposition 
against their adult roles.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,243
What makes stranger things unique is 
that the kids win by being kit rather 

15
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,850
than by growing up or pretending to be 
adults.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,863
By paying attention to the way stranger 
things in Birch that convention and 

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:07,920
shows the inherent power of children,
we can perhaps better understand why the

18
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,380
series resonates so much for 
millennials.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,020
Being a kid at heart doesn't mean you're
regressing.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,960
Sometimes it means being a total bad 
ass.

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,973
Welcome.
This wisecrack addition on stranger 

22
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:22,050
things and as always spoilers ahead if 
you need to get caught up.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
Here's a quick rundown on the first 
season,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,833
a decade before the start of the show,
a secret government funded experiment 

25
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:31,440
kidnaps a girl names her 11 and it makes
her use her psychic powers to spy on the

26
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,274
Soviets and whoops,
summon a demon hell beast from another 

27
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,180
dimension.
This piece of tax,

28
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,900
a boy named will and brings him back to,
it's really depressing home dimension,

29
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,380
which is just like earth except the 
atmosphere is full of Kleenex pieces and

30
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,000
everything is kind of dam wills.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,030
Three best friends,
Dustin Lucas and Mike set out on a quest

32
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,150
to find him once 11 escapes or creepy 
fake dad.

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,073
She joins the junior rescue crew and the
rest as they say is eight hours of 

34
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,484
quality television,
80s and 90s kid nostalgia certainly 

35
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,020
helped give rise to the popularity of 
the show,

36
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,410
but that nostalgia extends far beyond 
the reach of Netflix.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,100
We also see a certain longing for the 
past in the current millennial obsession

38
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:12,060
with toys witnessed the insane 
popularity of Funko pop figurines,

39
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,894
hoverboards and subscription boxes 
filled with everything from star wars 

40
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:16,314
pillows to Batman themed ramen bowls,
toys as a symbol express 

41
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,514
lightheartedness and innocence,
but they're also an important means for 

42
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,874
rational and emotional connection.
Toddlers learn about the world through 

43
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,640
their toys.
Children use toys to share or fight with

44
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,160
friends and to act out the possibilities
of the future.

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,210
Despite this many popular depictions of 
toys trivialize their role,

46
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,103
labeled them as immature and their 
popularity has given rise to dozens of 

47
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:42,810
really think pieces on how millennials 
need to grow up.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,913
Stranger things takes toys seriously.
They're not only an essential part of 

49
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,084
the storyline there,
the foundation on which the rest of the 

50
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:50,814
story is built.
The quintessential example of this is 

51
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,994
the way that the language of dungeons 
and dragons is used to make sense of 

52
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:00,640
events both for our plucky gang of four 
and for the viewers themselves.

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,533
We were thinking of more of an able to 
mention like do they look shadows when 

54
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,030
we first meet the boys in episode one 
there in Mike's basement playing d and,

55
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,864
d,
The demo gorgon monster is first shown 

56
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,174
is a figurine in their campaign and so 
when they meet the interdimensional 

57
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,610
monster later on,
they talk about it in terms of a monster

58
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,540
they are familiar with.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,970
This is one of my,
the demagoguery with your wrist rocket.

60
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,140
I took art to do to go into fight darth 
vader.

61
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,870
The same is true of the alternate 
dimension.

62
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,530
The Monster hails from as 11 tries to 
explain what this place is.

63
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,423
Nobody understands until she takes the 
campaign board and flips it upside down 

64
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,030
to represent an alternate and parallel 
side to our own reality.

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,253
Since those concepts are fundamental to 
making sense of the paranormal element 

66
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:41,110
in the boys' lives there also 
fundamental to the viewer.

67
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,123
We really have no way to understand or 
express the upside down or the Demo 

68
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,880
Gordon,
except through the language of d and d.

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,110
That board and that figurine shaped the 
mythology for the entire series.

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,700
We see the same kind of language framing
in Dustin's constant references to comic

71
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,930
books and Star Wars.

72
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,973
Do you think 11 was born with her powers
like the x men or do you think he 

73
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,520
acquired them like like Greenland here

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,503
to ham?
11 is one of the x men and the chief is 

75
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:09,474
Lando Kalryzian.
When the boys think he's setting them 

76
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:11,934
up,

77
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,910
what were the chief set us up,
Nancy,

78
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,290
maybe Lado Corinthian.
Would you shut up about Lando?

79
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,690
Dustin knows that Jean Grey has 
telekinesis,

80
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:24,750
so 11 similar powers don't seem 
impossible.

81
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,763
His relationship to games and toys and 
cartoons gives him and the other 

82
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:31,920
children the ability to understand.
It's powerful.

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,680
What does,
this is Hawkins.

84
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,250
This is the robos.

85
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,203
In contrast.
Joy sees evidence of the paranormal and 

86
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:45,240
it pretty much destroys her because she 
has no way to communicate this knowledge

87
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,280
to the other adults or even herself

88
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,710
is after him.
He said danger.

89
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:50,930
We have to find,

90
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,950
everyone thinks she's cuckoo for cocoa 
puffs because they simply don't have the

91
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:59,330
right frame of reference to make sense 
of the events except for Mr.

92
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,163
Clark.
His connection to childhood toys and 

93
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:02,024
Games makes him an understanding ally 
who entertains the idea of an upside 

94
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,580
down well before the other adults.
You know,

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,060
that'll shadows echo of the material 
plane where necrotic and shadow magic.

96
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,990
Exactly the significance of toys goes 
beyond just making sense of the Eggo.

97
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,840
Snuffing demi goddess in the basement on
one level,

98
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,703
stranger things gives credibility to 
toys by showing that they have the 

99
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,004
potential to be powerful.
When Lucas suggest bringing his wrist 

100
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:27,530
rocket on their adventures,
even his friends make fun of him.

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,960
You're going to take out the demo Gorgon
with a slingshot,

102
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,973
and it's true that in the end,
the wrist rocket gets literally beaten 

103
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,900
to the Punch by 11 psychic attack on the
demo.

104
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,733
Gorgon.
This may seem like it detracts from our 

105
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:39,164
argument,
but the mere fact that the wrist rocket 

106
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:41,354
was part of the fight shows that it 
can't be easily dismissed successfully 

107
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:45,920
or not.
That slingshot,

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,783
that toy fought a monster from another 
dimension in the world of stranger 

109
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,370
things,
toys become objects of great utility.

110
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,383
Nancy's costume chest provides 11 the 
ability to move around comfortably in 

111
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,980
public.
She can go to school,

112
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,620
meet adults,
and navigate the world more easily after

113
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,340
she plays dress up without the new found
confidence provided by the dress and the

114
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,174
blonde wig.
11 wouldn't have found will on the heat 

115
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,560
hit radio or saved Mike from the class 
bullies.

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
She has super powers,
but a dress up bin did something that 

117
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,903
esp couldn't.
We can also see the utility of toys and 

118
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:21,050
will's homeaway from home castle buyers.
It's a kid's fort built in the backyard,

119
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,840
but it probably saves his life when he's
in the upside down.

120
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,330
Not only does it shelter him from the 
Demo Gorgon,

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,193
at least for a little while.
It's also somewhat implied that the 

122
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:29,834
sense of familiarity and comfort 
provided by the Fort helps to keep him 

123
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,320
alive in the toxic atmosphere.
Perhaps one of the most obvious examples

124
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,070
is the scene where Joyce and 11 pulled 
together a makeshift sensory deprivation

125
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,620
tank so that our girl Elle can go 
dimension hopping.

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,693
They go to a school and Philip,
a Kiddie pool that was once used to bob 

127
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,724
for apples.
This scenario despite the participation 

128
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,664
of the adults is so laden with kid 
fueled ingenuity that it's almost over 

129
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,654
the top,
but it's that kitty pool that makes it 

130
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:59,330
possible for 11 to discover barbs body.
Sometimes the role of toys in the show,

131
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,164
it's a little less blatant.
You might've forgotten the scenes were 

132
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,804
11 practices,
her powers on the Millennium Falcon 

133
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,114
figurine or when we'll get an Atari for 
Christmas at the end of the first 

134
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:08,504
season,
definitely an Atari and Atari by making 

135
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,100
toys.

136
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,933
A constant presence in the show.
Stranger things emphasizes their 

137
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,040
omnipresence and importance in the lives
of children.

138
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,640
The significance of toys isn't always 
limited to the kids either.

139
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,553
There are also a few occasions where 
toys are important tools for teens and 

140
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:26,954
adults.
Joyce's alphabet light display looks an 

141
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,384
awful lot like a wiki board.
Nancy and Jonathan basically recreate 

142
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,300
home alone to catch a monster and top it
off with a smiley face.

143
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,000
Yoyo.
Jonathan's very fancy camera is referred

144
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,400
to as his toy was have to take away his 
toy.

145
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,183
Please got the camera and it's key to 
documenting the existence of the demic 

146
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:48,140
organ by first producing another toy,
a puzzle.

147
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,750
These examples all point to the same 
idea.

148
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,740
The Times when the teens and adults are 
most successful at fighting the enemy or

149
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,490
understanding the world are when they 
adopt the conventions of kids.

150
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,890
This isn't just children having power.

151
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,753
It's the power of childhood itself.
We can see an interesting presentation 

152
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:05,744
of this idea.
In the case of the walkie talkies and 

153
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:08,264
the campuses used in the show,
radios and campuses are not inherently 

154
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,254
toys.
They're primarily used for adults for 

155
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,730
distinctly uncoil like purposes,
but in stranger things.

156
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,623
They are toys used by the boys as a form
of play prior to taking on their 

157
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:21,554
strategic roles.
The walkie talkies are vital for 

158
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:24,494
communication during the search for will
and the magnetic misdirection of the 

159
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:31,880
campuses leads the gang to the 
conclusion that the portal is inside the

160
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,713
Department of Energy Facility,
but we don't see the adults using them 

161
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,500
to similar effect.
The police have radios,

162
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,334
but they never hold the same kind of 
power or usefulness as the toy radios 

163
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,054
belonging to the kids.
So stranger things takes toys seriously 

164
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,490
because it takes childhood itself 
seriously.

165
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,920
The kids don't save the day despite 
being kids.

166
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,440
They save the day because they were 
kids.

167
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,513
This doesn't mean that everyone loving 
the show wishes they were actually 10 

168
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:55,574
years.
Again,

169
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,470
I wouldn't deal with troy and his elk 
for all the fun dips in the world,

170
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,090
but stranger things fights back against 
the idea that being a kid or liking toys

171
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:03,924
is some sort of deficiency.
There isn't just nostalgia in 

172
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:08,670
remembering childhood.
There's power to,

173
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,683
so what does it mean to give toys?
This kind of influence by empowering 

174
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,254
childhood is stranger things.
Fanning the flames of our nostalgia 

175
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,194
driven culture.
Is it fighting against that by making 

176
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:21,300
childhood into something more than an 
ironic tee shirt?

177
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,403
Either way,
we're happy to keep watching season two 

178
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,520
pass the eggos and thanks for watching

want something a little more 

180
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,890
substantial,
