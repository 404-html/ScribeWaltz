1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,223
In the entire universe.
The two greatest scientific mysteries 

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:05,820
are,
first of all,

3
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:09,630
the origin of the universe itself.
And second of all,

4
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:12,810
the origin of intelligence,
believe it or not,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,653
sitting on our shoulders,
is the most complex object that mother 

6
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,340
nature has created in the known 
universe.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,683
You have to go at least 24 trillion 
miles to the nearest star defined a 

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:30,360
planet that may have life and may have 
intelligence,

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,763
and yet our brain only consumes about 
2030 watts of power and yet it 

10
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:39,720
performance calculations better than any
large supercomputer.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,200
So it's a mystery.
How is the brain wired up?

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,243
And if we can figure that out,
what can we do with it to enhance our 

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:48,504
mental capabilities?
When you look at the brain and all the 

14
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,834
parts of the brain,
they don't seem to make any sense at 

15
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:54,444
all.
The visual part of the brain is way in 

16
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:56,580
the back.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,413
For example,
why is the brain constructed the way it 

18
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,804
is?
It's just nothing but an accident of 

19
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,910
evolution.
Well,

20
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,940
one way to look at it is through 
evolution.

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,810
That is the back of the brain is the 
sole call reptilian brain.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,570
The most ancient primitive part of their
brain,

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,070
their governance,
balanced,

24
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,020
territoriality,
mating,

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,273
and so they're very back of the brain is
also the kind of brand that you find in 

26
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,604
reptiles and when I was a child,
I would go to the Science Museum and 

27
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,594
look at the snake sometimes and they 
would stare back at me and I would 

28
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,540
wonder,
what are they thinking about?

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,280
Well,
I think no,

30
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:36,150
I know what they're thinking about was 
is this person lunch?

31
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,883
Then we have the center part of the 
brain going forward and that's a so 

32
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,990
called monkey brain,
the Mammalian brain,

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,190
the brain of emotions,
the brain of social hierarchies.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,970
Then finally the front of the brain is 
the human brain,

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,013
especially the prefrontal cortex.
This is where rational thinking is and 

36
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:00,540
when he asked his self a question,
where am I anyway,

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,600
the answer is right behind your 
forehead.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,750
That's where you really are.
Well,

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,130
I have a theory of consciousness which 
tries to wrap it all up together.

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,510
There have been about 20,000
or so papers written about consciousness

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,733
and no consensus,
never in the history of science have so 

42
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:23,280
many people devoted so much time to 
produce.

43
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,190
So little well,
I'm a physicist.

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,060
And when we physicists look at a 
mysterious object,

45
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,910
the first day we tried to do is to 
create a model,

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,133
a model of this object in space,
and then we hit the play button and run 

47
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:39,354
it forward in time.
This is how Newton was able to come up 

48
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,770
with a theory of gravity.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
This is how Einstein came up with 
relativity.

50
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,210
So I tried to use this in terms of the 
human brain and evolution.

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,433
So what I'm saying is I have a new 
theory of consciousness based on 

52
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,154
evolution.
And that is consciousness is the number 

53
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,744
of feedback loops required to create a 
model of your position in space with 

54
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:12,250
relationship to other organisms.
And finally in relationship to time.

55
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,670
So think of the consciousness of a 
thermostat.

56
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,150
I believe that even a lowly thermostat 
has one unit of consciousness that is,

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,960
it senses the temperature around it.
And then we have a flower.

58
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,530
A flower has maybe,
maybe 10 units of consciousness.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,930
It has to understand,
uh,

60
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,670
the temperature,
the weather,

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,504
humidity where gravity is pointing.
And then finally we go to the reptilian 

62
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,600
brain,
which are called level one.

63
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:41,434
Consciousness.
And reptiles basically have a very good 

64
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,090
understanding of their position in 
space,

65
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,360
especially cause they have to lunch out 
and grab prey.

66
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,900
Then we have level two consciousness,
the monkey consciousness,

67
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,230
the consciousness of emotions,
social hierarchies.

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,930
Where are we in relationship to the 
tribe?

69
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,610
And then where are we as humans,
as humans?

70
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:08,590
We are in at level three,
we run simulations into the future.

71
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,510
Animals apparently don't do this.
They don't plan to hibernate.

72
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,613
They don't plan the next day's agenda.
They have no conception of tomorrow to 

73
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,020
the best of our ability.
But that's what our brain does.

74
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,123
Our brain is a prediction machine.
And so when we look at the evolution 

75
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,980
from the reptilian brain,
the mammalian brain,

76
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:30,814
to the prefrontal Cortex,
we realized that it's the process of 

77
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,630
understanding our position and space 
with respect to others.

78
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,490
That is emotions.
And finally,

79
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,160
running simulations into the future.
