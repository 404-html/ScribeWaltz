00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,910
This video is brought to you by 
Skillshare,

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,620
a wise crack jared in the pale flesh.
Again,

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,990
today we've got an episode for you about
Pokemon go,

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,610
urban exploration and some dead French 
guy,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,170
fusion,
pokemon go temporarily gripped the world

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,140
like an epidemic.
The augmented reality mobile game,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,033
just days after it's released,
was installed in five percent of all 

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,880
android devices and even surpassed 
tinder in downloads.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,080
To say that we were gripped by Pocomania
all over again is an understatement.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,860
The media and now wisecrack just 
wouldn't shut up about it.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,150
Pokemon goers have discovered dead 
bodies been lured into being robbed,

12
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:42,984
crash their cars,
and even trolled the Westboro Baptist 

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,860
church.
At the same time,

14
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,694
plenty of people were less than an 
hammered by Pokemongo filmmaker Oliver 

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,840
Stone decried the games ramp in data 
collection as a new form of surveillance

16
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:55,674
capitalism.
He also warned that the idea of people 

17
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,434
running around to catch imaginary 
monsters as dictated by a giant 

18
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,340
corporation can go by another name,
totalitarianism,

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,710
so it's Pokemongo a nightmare.

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,380
Confluence of phone addiction and 
corporate surveillance.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,423
Maybe let's find out.
Welcome to this wise crack addition on 

22
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:14,754
the philosophy of pokemon go,
and for once no spoilers ahead at its 

23
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,644
heart,
pokemon go is a game about walking you 

24
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,614
saunter to a pokey stop dash towards a 
raid stampede towards a dragonite 

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,950
trespass into a neighbor's yard,
stumble into a crime scene,

26
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,784
and so on,
and while walking may seem as 

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,040
philosophically unimportant as an Adam 
Sandler movie,

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,370
you'd be surprised,
but before we can understand how pokemon

29
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:41,640
go radically changes how we interact 
with physical spaces,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,630
we need a little history of walking.
Unsurprisingly,

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,493
walking played a prominent role in 
society until the rise of the 

32
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:49,764
automobile,
besides getting people from point a to 

33
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:52,524
point b,
walking was a sort of sport and 

34
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,870
aristocratic circles as Frederic Gros 
writes in his book,

35
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,704
a philosophy of walking well to do.
Men and women would stroll around in 

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,693
fancy clothes,
occasionally striking a pose to woo 

37
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,790
potential suitors.

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,310
It was kind of like the physical 
manifestation of rich people.

39
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:14,190
Selfies on Instagram for others,
walking was a holy matter every year.

40
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:18,120
Scores of people would undergo a 
pilgrimage to various sanctified sites.

41
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,223
Meanwhile,
philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche 

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,413
saw walking as an invaluable part of the
philosophical process today are walking 

43
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,580
and movement in general still serves a 
social function,

44
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,950
though it's a little more pragmatic.
Now,

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,920
our morning commute running to the 
grocery store,

46
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,110
picking up sunny Jim from soccer 
practice.

47
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,100
Most of these comings and goings are 
programmed into our daily lives.

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,143
We move from place to place,
generally unaware of our surroundings 

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,193
and never venture far from our planned 
route all to fulfill our societal 

50
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,694
obligations as gross writes this kind of
rushing around is always in the service 

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,853
of doing something and never to just be 
walking according to gross is in its 

52
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,414
purest form about doing nothing which 
allows us to rediscover the simple joy 

53
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,334
of existing I kind of childlike 
wonderment with the world surrounding 

54
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:09,840
us.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,580
Some might argue that pokemongo 
according to this logic,

56
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,414
follows the always doing something logic
of our time frantically running from 

57
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,923
pokestop to pokey.
Stop chasing down legendary rates and 

58
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,124
battling.
Kim's isn't exactly the kind of 

59
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,280
exploration grosses,
writing about.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,960
We'll tackle that in just a second,
but first let's talk about space.

61
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,303
Every street building and open space 
carries with it and assumed social code 

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,110
wouldn't behave in an office building 
the same way you would at a concert.

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,153
You don't play football and freeway and 
many would say it's important to wear 

64
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,504
your black sabbath tee shirt to church,
but those social codes change with time 

65
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,230
and culture.
Public bathing used to be a thing.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,153
Bars used to be a place to find a date 
and rivers used to be a fine place for 

67
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,530
you to drop,
trow and do your business.

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,903
Pokemon go and the technology it uses 
might change everything by radically 

69
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,520
recoding.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,353
This space that we live in the game has 
literally mapped onto reality and 

71
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:11,590
entirely new set of social codes,
parks for hiking now,

72
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,270
more like a sweet place to battle of 
Mutu churches for worship now,

73
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,450
pokey balls for days and it crowd all 
running in the same direction could be a

74
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,504
Zombie apocalypse,
but it could also be an unknown museums 

75
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,260
to memorialize the millions of people 
slaughtered more like,

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,513
okay,
seriously,

77
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,510
don't play pokemon go and the Holocaust 
museum in short,

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,170
Pokemongo disrupts how we perceive 
space.

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,513
There's a common fear with pokemon go,
should we really trust a massive 

80
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,444
corporation with such intimate knowledge
of where we're going and how we're 

81
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,104
getting there?
Is it a little scary that a company can 

82
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,344
so artfully tell us where to go?
Niantic has integrated sponsored pokey 

83
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,900
stops and starbucks,
for instance,

84
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,734
was more than happy to oblige.
The idea is you get to buy a Pumpkin 

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,533
Spice Latte once you've decided to take 
a break from catching mythical monsters 

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,300
so far,
aside from some sponsored pokey sops,

87
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,173
that intake has taken the high road 
organizing things like beach cleanups 

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,033
for Earth Day,
but that doesn't mean it can't go 

89
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,330
downhill fairly quickly.

90
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,373
What if you could pay niantic a couple 
million dollars to have a rare pokemon 

91
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,544
spawn at your political rally or worse,
your friends Improv show for French 

92
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,620
philosopher,
Guy Debord.

93
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,730
Modern capitalism has neatly organized 
time and physical space.

94
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,700
Where we are,
where we're going and when we're getting

95
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,370
there is a function of the totalizing 
control.

96
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,550
The economy plays in our lives.
We traveled through life,

97
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,190
mesmerized by our commodity filled 
environment.

98
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,070
We go to work to make money to a leisure
activity,

99
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,810
to spend money,
go home,

100
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,763
go to sleep,
and repeat with a sort of systemic 

101
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,930
pressure to do this in a more and more 
productive way.

102
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,670
Work harder,
enjoy more sleepless.

103
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,040
You get the idea for some pokemon go,
easily fits this dystopic narrative.

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,233
Yesterday,
we were mesmerized by billboards and 

105
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,910
where they told us to go probably to 
some tgi Friday's today.

106
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:11,570
We're mesmerized by our phone screens 
and where they tell us to go.

107
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,280
What's missing from all this is chance,
randomness and discovery,

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,860
but before you think we're being overly 
paranoid,

109
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:23,480
edge Laura's those who decry pokemon go 
as the harbinger of some dystopic,

110
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,481
augmented reality are only half right,
Pokemongo as Edwin Montoya's rewrites in

111
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,260
the Hong Kong.
Review of books resembles deary.

112
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,343
A revolutionary strategy proposed by 
debord to combat the entrenched and 

113
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,620
alienated ways in which we move through 
cities do receive,

114
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,503
which is French,
for drifting means abandoning the 

115
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:46,340
preprogrammed way in which we interact 
with cities.

116
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,010
By performing a sort of experiment in 
space,

117
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,540
wandering around aimlessly,
debord encourages people to walk around,

118
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,330
be drawn in by their surroundings,
interrogate them,

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,480
and to give themselves up to randomness,
and that's kind of what pokemon go does.

120
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,743
Players venture to locations they never 
would have dreamed of going to namely 

121
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,870
outside,
but if you're anything like me,

122
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,450
you've discovered new neighborhoods,
new landmarks,

123
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,610
and even this one's a shocker.

124
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,593
Made friends in the myspace.
Pokemon go is combating the kind of 

125
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:21,740
social alienation that our culture 
actively promotes.

126
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,753
Well,
most games have you glued to a screen 

127
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:27,350
with headphones on.
Pokemon go encourages you to explore and

128
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,200
make new friends.
After the raid system was introduced,

129
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,063
you could battle boss level pokemon for 
a limited time with friends or 

130
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,560
strangers.
They also recently rolled out trading,

131
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:39,290
adding new ways to meet new people.
Psychologists,

132
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,143
we've been noticed that the game was 
helping their patients with anxiety and 

133
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,880
depression by getting them to get out of
the house and socialize in this way,

134
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:51,110
pokemon go actively recode's the space 
around us in a positive way.

135
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,423
It might not be exactly the kind of 
revolutionary walking that debord 

136
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:58,670
envision or the useless kind of walking 
gross writes about,

137
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,803
but it's also better than the 
alternative that are tech obsessed 

138
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,530
society offers us.

139
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,843
Who knows?
Maybe pokemon go is a gateway drug for 

140
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:07,634
hiking and social interaction.
What do you think wise crack is pokemon 

141
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:11,594
go's society,
savior or a harbinger of disciple times 

142
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,014
to come?
Or is it just a game about animals and 

143
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:17,714
balls?
Let us know what to think in the 

144
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,570
comments and as always,
thanks for watching.

145
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,270
Hey wisecrack.
It's Alec Polka Master.

146
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,880
Extraordinary reading.
This episode was a ton of fun,

147
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:30,110
but we came across one big problem.
Jared went on a much deserved vacation,

148
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,363
so in service of Jarrod's mental health,
a bunch of us in the office have to do
