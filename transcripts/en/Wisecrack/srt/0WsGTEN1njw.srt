1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,113
One of the reasons that the gun debate 
in this country is so contentious is 

2
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:09,984
that there's very little good data on 
who owns guns and what share of guns 

3
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,704
used in crimes are illegal guns.
And part of the reason there's not good 

4
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,860
data is because the debate is so 
contentious in the first place.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,723
But you know,
one proposal that I like a lot is to 

6
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:30,480
create kind of a national firearms 
safety administration,

7
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,020
something like the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration Nitsa,

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,063
which correlates transportation data.
So if we want to know about what really 

9
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,421
causes,
you know,

10
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:42,780
there's still 30 to 35,000
traffic fatalities a year,

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,330
that's a lot considering how much we 
drive.

12
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,200
It's not that much,
but it's,

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,063
that's a lot of death.
The more we know about how every 

14
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,410
accident happens,
the better we can do at preventing.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,303
Similarly with something like guns,
the more we know about how guns are 

16
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,784
used,
how they get in the hands of the people 

17
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,760
who use them for crime.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,220
The vast majority of guns are never,
ever,

19
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,840
ever,
ever used in any crime.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,250
So,
you know,

21
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,084
um,
that I think is a really useful way to 

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,803
look at what data can do.
I think right now we have people on the 

23
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,300
gun on one side of the gun debate 
saying,

24
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,330
you know,
uh,

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,940
we need our guns for whatever and uh,
you know,

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,680
leave us alone.
The other side saying,

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,563
ah,
all guns are terrible and you need to 

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,220
take them all away.
Um,

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,700
both those arguments would seem to be a 
little bit naive,

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,970
but we can't really get to a better 
place because we don't have the data.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,990
I,
you know,

32
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,930
I grew up in,
I personally grew up in a gun culture.

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,290
I grew up in upstate New York where most
families had guns for hunting,

34
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,250
target practice,
whatever.

35
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,450
The vast majority of people I knew never
use their guns for any crime.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,433
Most laws that we make to protect people
from guns are usually ignored by the 

37
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,970
criminals and obeyed by the law abiding 
people.

38
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,030
And so I think that if you had better 
data,

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,260
there'd be no one more in favor of it 
than law abiding gun owners because they

40
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,230
don't want to be smeared and lumped in 
with the criminals who use guns.

41
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,630
So that's where data,
um,

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,733
can be kind of different tool in the 
arsenal when you're trying to make 

43
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:11,874
better policy or public policy because 
otherwise you're just kind of shouting 

44
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:16,704
at each other with your ideology rather 
than understanding how people actually 

45
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:20,454
behave.

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,953
Okay.
