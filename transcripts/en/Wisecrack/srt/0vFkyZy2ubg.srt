00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,660
There's been a lot of talk over the past
few years.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,783
Um,
and in some popular books about the 

3
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:08,504
power of intuition and how if we trust 
that our intuitions or went with our 

4
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,464
guts more often,
we would actually wind up making better 

5
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,280
decisions in the world would even be a 
better place.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,383
Some researchers have talked about how 
our intuitions and the intuitive 

7
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:22,034
judgments we can make,
the snap judgements are actually 

8
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:26,870
accurate a lot of the time.
And a lot of that is true.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,943
But what we noticed when thinking about 
our gorilla experiment and doing 

10
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:31,544
research for this book is that there's a
whole category of intuitions that are 

11
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,760
actually systematically wrong and in 
very dangerous ways.

12
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,580
And those are the intuitions we have 
about how our own minds work.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,683
So the gorilla experiment shows that we 
intuitively think that we pay attention 

14
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:46,580
to a notice much more than we actually 
do.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,470
And that can have tragic consequences if
you get into a car accident or at one of

16
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,304
the examples in our book is a nuclear 
submarine that surfaced right into a 

17
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:55,874
Japanese fishing boat because in part 
the captain of the submarine looked up 

18
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,584
in the periscope,
didn't see any boats around and surface 

19
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,224
right into one that he didn't see.
That was actually probably right in 

20
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,094
front of him.
So there's a case where intuitively we 

21
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,750
think something and it can really get us
into big trouble.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,673
We realized as we were thinking about 
the book and putting together the idea 

23
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:17,360
is that this category of intuitions is 
very broad.

24
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:20,120
It's not just about visual attention,
it's also about memory.

25
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,000
We think we remember things much more 
accurately than we really do.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,560
I,
it's about confidence.

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,053
We think that people who are confident 
are also more skilled and accurate and 

28
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,490
knowledgeable.
It's about our own knowledge.

29
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,324
We think that we know and understand 
more about the world and we really do 

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,620
and so on.
They're sort of like a whole sort of set

31
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,620
of these intuitions which,
um,

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,880
can really lead us astray if we're not 
aware of them.

33
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:42,470
And that's what we decided to write the 
book about.

34
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,103
We are in a way,
taking on the impression that a lot of 

35
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:49,984
people have from books like blink by 
Malcolm Gladwell and others in that 

36
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,980
category,
which is sort of an uncritical belief in

37
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,380
the power of intuition and snap 
judgments and so on.

38
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:00,590
And the idea that,
um,

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,410
you should rely on them whenever 
possible.

40
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,060
Um,
we sort of are,

41
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,013
uh,
in a sense taking on the cult of 

42
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,650
intuition or the myth of intuition as we
call it in the book.

43
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,723
I should also say that we're very 
pleased at Malcolm gladwell actually 

44
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:12,754
read our original scientific journal 
Article about the invisible gorilla 

45
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:18,340
study and talked about it and one of his
New Yorker articles,

46
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,174
which helped it get more publicity and 
ultimately led to it becoming more 

47
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:23,220
widely known,
uh,

48
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,580
and as famous as it is.
