1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,833
The pharmaceutical industry has an 
important role to play in American 

2
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,160
health.
First of all,

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,320
uh,
this is a lifesaving industry.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,693
This is the industry that we hope is 
going to be able to control Alzheimer's 

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,610
and Parkinson's and these other diseases
of the elderly.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,141
Uh,
so,

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,390
um,
we are dependent upon the pharmaceutical

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,400
industry,
but at the same time,

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,400
prescription drugs cost too much in this
country.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,803
And we have to really move to generics.
We have to get costs so that they're 

11
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:34,974
affordable for people.
We have to figure out a way so that the 

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,544
pharmaceutical companies can make a 
reasonable profit and people can afford 

13
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,430
their drugs.
And right now we're not there.
