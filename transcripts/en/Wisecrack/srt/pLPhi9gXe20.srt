00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,960
This video supported by our friends over
at Cheddar.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,250
Hey,
wise crack jared here.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,650
Unless you're living in a galaxy far,
far away,

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,500
you've probably heard about the recent 
star wars backlash.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,210
Some fans hated last I so much they 
issued an anti Disney manifesto,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,133
run an actress off instagram,
are crowdfunding for a remake and have 

7
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:26,140
claimed credit for Solos failure at the 
box office.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,980
There were even rumors that Kathleen 
Kennedy v President of Lucas films would

9
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,680
retire early,
possibly influenced by twitter.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,180
This may seem like a bunch of fanboys 
throwing tantrums or Russian bots.

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,340
And while both of those may be partly 
true,

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,460
I can't help but think there's something
way deeper going on here.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,443
So join us as we try to use philosophy 
to explain the current crisis of the 

14
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:49,240
Star Wars Universe and some minor last 
jet.

15
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:50,074
I spoilers ahead.
Also for any of our fans that live in 

16
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:52,714
la,
we're going to be hosting a live 

17
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:54,364
Halloween show on October 26 with our 
movie podcast crew and Adam Kovac from 

18
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,434
fun house.
So check out the invite and the link to 

19
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,374
tickets in the description.
But first a quick recap of what people 

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,064
hate about the new star wars.
While there's some rather unpleasant 

21
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,770
threads of criticism on the Internet,
some people hate the new star wars for a

22
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:12,604
reason.
That director Ryan Johnson is pretty 

23
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:17,950
overt about subverting the Canon or as 
he likes to call it,

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,150
killing the past

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,900
raised parents aren't skywalkers or 
[inaudible] or some other great family,

26
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,530
but nobody's,
despite the constant mystery box teasing

27
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:43,364
in the force awakens,
we get no storied rise of snuck or 

28
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,140
reveal that he's Mace Windu or 
something,

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,100
just an unceremonious death and then 
there's luke.

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,083
We're supposed to believe this wholesome
hero who once saw the light in the 

31
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:56,564
darkest of villains is now throwing 
light sabers off cliffs and almost 

32
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:03,710
killing his child nephew.
That just didn't seem right with Disney.

33
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,544
Now putting all of their extended 
universe movies on hold and New Star 

34
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,850
Wars spinoffs getting universally panned
by fans.

35
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,120
It seems like the world of star wars is 
in crisis.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,253
What's happening with star wars is not 
so different from a problem often faced 

37
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:18,854
by social systems or what political 
philosopher Juergen Habermas calls a 

38
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,600
legitimation crisis,
I.

39
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,434
E.
N existential crisis that threatens the 

40
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:27,410
foundation of a social system.

41
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,200
Social Systems are made of three 
subparts,

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,180
the governmental,
the socio cultural,

43
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:35,810
and the economic.
They all interact and in some ways these

44
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,960
three systems map onto the system of 
star wars fandom.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,180
Let's start with the government side.
See,

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,900
the system needs some kind of story or 
idea to give it legitimacy.

47
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,940
Governments do this through different 
means.

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,060
Monarchies claim their legitimacy is 
derived from God.

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,190
Democracies through election by the 
people,

50
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,250
constitutional governments through well 
constitutions.

51
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,520
Even dictators claim legitimacy in one 
way or another.

52
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,120
Some by they represent the will of the 
people.

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,193
Other things help to making sure your 
citizens are warm and fed or the 

54
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,274
economic does wonders to make them ask 
fewer questions about how or why your 

55
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,780
allowed to be in.
So what happens when this is called into

56
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:14,614
question?
What happens when the people no longer 

57
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,704
feel a system is upholding its values or
that those values are antiquated and 

58
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:21,880
useless?

59
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,713
What if people feel betrayed when a huge
corporation takes over their beloved 

60
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:30,220
franchise only to birth what some 
consider to be an unholy abomination.

61
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,880
When this happens,
people stop obeying and start rebelling.

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,013
Think about countries whose populations 
take to the streets when they suspect 

63
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,260
that their new leaders rig the election 
and therefore aren't legitimate.

64
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,660
If we use this as a metaphor for star 
wars,

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,523
a lot of things start to make sense.
Lucas was basically the divinely 

66
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,140
ordained monarch of the Star Wars 
Universe,

67
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,600
which consisted not just at the six 
films he made,

68
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,420
but also a ton of spinoffs in the form 
of video games,

69
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,640
board games,
cartoons and tie in novels.

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,520
They got the royal seal of approval from
Lucasfilm,

71
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,370
so maybe it's more like a constitutional
monarchy,

72
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,250
but his legitimacy also came from the 
fact that he,

73
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,084
you know,
created it all together with Lucas Star 

74
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,383
Wars fans helped create a fully 
functioning social system with shared 

75
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:14,410
practices,
beliefs,

76
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,810
values,
and agreed upon rules of operation.

77
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,530
That's what harbor might call the socio 
cultural side of this system.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,560
Habermas calls this kind of socially 
cohesive system.

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,680
Laytonsville a life world.
And the Jed,

80
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,690
I could Laban Svelte with the best of 
them.

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,900
The general meaning of Star Wars,
the values it represents,

82
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:35,410
the characters that is develop,
the stories it tells and the themes that

83
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:39,730
define it were originally laid out by 
Lucas and we're more or less agreed upon

84
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,350
within the community.
Okay,

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
maybe you hate George Jar book.
You got over it.

86
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,800
Lucas's word was still star wars law.
Even if you didn't exactly like it,

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,680
they need a medical rank like all life 
worlds.

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,573
This star wars universe also helped 
create a sense of individual identity 

89
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,360
when people use these values and beliefs
to make meaning of their lives.

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,463
That is until 2012 when Disney bought 
Lucas films and she started to get 

91
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,054
crazy,
I guess you could say there's been a 

92
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,094
regime change and suddenly,
at least from the perspective of some 

93
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,424
fans,
Lord Lucas was replaced by a money 

94
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:12,580
hungry animated mouse.

95
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,740
Now do we have a problem?
It's like the governmental equivalent of

96
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:21,010
Queen Elizabeth relinquishing the throne
and after a nice surprise,

97
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,110
ending the British monarchy to Mary 
Berry.

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,393
After Disney gained rights to all star 
wars intellectual property and started 

99
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,414
making controversial decisions,
they found themselves in a big old 

100
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:31,954
legitimation crisis.
What the fan base is going through can 

101
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,254
perhaps be best understood by looking at
one of the biggest legitimation crises 

102
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,124
of the last millennia,
one that changed the landscape of the 

103
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,970
entire world.
You see,

104
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:43,804
Disney is facing the same kind of 
legitimation crisis the Catholic Church 

105
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,350
did in the 15 hundreds when their 
congregations began to rebel.

106
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,513
Up until the 16th century,
the leadership of the Catholic Church 

107
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,960
had total control over the meaning of 
the Bible.

108
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,680
Since only priests,
bishops,

109
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,410
the pope and maybe the occasional rich 
guy had access to hard copies.

110
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,380
Books,
including the Bible,

111
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:06,590
were so expensive that very few ever 
learned to read.

112
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,150
This famously allowed the church to get 
away with some seriously shady shit like

113
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:11,984
making people pay the church and the 
form of indulgences to get their loved 

114
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,344
ones out of purgatory.
But all that changed when good old 

115
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:18,484
Johnny Gutenberg invented the printing 
press in 1440 and enabled the rapid 

116
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,114
reproduction of texts.
Suddenly regular people could read the 

117
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,324
Bible and what do you know?
They had slightly different 

118
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,410
interpretations of some of those crucial
techs.

119
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,543
In this case,
a crisis of legitimation happened 

120
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,734
because the masses,
we're no longer merely consuming 

121
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,404
religious meaning,
but also helping produce canonical 

122
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,524
interpretations.
The legitimacy and authority of the 

123
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,733
Catholic Church was seriously thrown 
into question by people like Martin 

124
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,613
Luther who posted 95 reasons why the 
Catholic church sucked right on their 

125
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,484
door.
This crisis of legitimation and the 

126
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:55,280
proliferation of different kinds of 
Christianity really sucked for Europe as

127
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,280
competing factions really,
really liked murdering each other.

128
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,503
So in this metaphor,
the Bible is the original star wars 

129
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,354
universe.
And why did George Lucas get to 

130
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:06,230
interpret it however he wanted because 
he wrote it,

131
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,423
maybe he's not Jesus in this analogy,
but he's at least an apostle or a 

132
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,994
prophet.
But now the authority has moved from a 

133
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:17,000
single divinely inspired leader to a 
larger and fallible organization.

134
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,490
And people question why they wield 
authority and developing clause.

135
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:23,270
I holy texts or it's Canon and the 
recent films,

136
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:24,104
but especially with the last Jedi,
they changed many of the agreed upon 

137
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,794
values,
meanings and truths of the star wars 

138
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,060
system.
If there was just a change of hands from

139
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,800
Lucas to Disney with the administration 
of star wars remaining mostly the same,

140
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,370
people may not have asked questions,
but without the legitimacy of Lucas,

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,390
people started asking more questions and
Disney didn't stop there.

142
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,343
They also put the very identity of the 
community when they took a super laser 

143
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:51,080
to the Canon,
the canonizing radio dramas,

144
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,370
video games,
comics,

145
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,204
and hundreds of spinoff novels that 
Lucasfilm previously considered part of 

146
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:56,924
the Gospel.

147
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,943
Remember that a life world is important 
because it defines a community by 

148
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,870
clarifying who's in and out and who you 
can trust.

149
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,853
You can't just go around hacking and 
slashing what counts as star wars 

150
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,004
because people's identities are wrapped 
up in this star wars enthusiasts aren't 

151
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,474
just consumers of this cannon.
They've helped make the meaning of the 

152
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,000
Star Wars universe like the Catholic 
church.

153
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,000
Disney now faces the wrath of the 
educated masses,

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,510
except now the problem isn't just that 
people can read a blog,

155
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,190
tweet,
make video essays,

156
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,024
produced their own cartoons and stream 
content to millions of viewers and for 

157
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,494
every Martin Luther,
there are a million angry youtubers and 

158
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,470
bloggers each posting their own 95 
problems with Disney star wars.

159
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,453
We live in an age where people aren't 
just consuming media but are also 

160
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,024
producing it where pro sumo and if 
protestantism emerged with a printing 

161
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,124
press and literacy took the interpretive
power away from the dude's with the 

162
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:49,730
funny hats.

163
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,563
It seems like the age of the prosumer 
empowers people to criticize the few 

164
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,734
anointed successors of Lucas.
Now pro-sumer I know it sounds like we 

165
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,124
made that word up,
but it's actually a technical term 

166
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,674
coined in the 1980s by Futurists,
Alvin and Heidi Toffler to describe how 

167
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:08,850
the role of the producer and consumer 
merge in the age of modern technology.

168
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,450
Star wars hands are basically prosumers.
Extraordinary.

169
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,980
Everyday fans have played a huge role in
creating meaning of star wars by sharing

170
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,920
youtube videos,
posting video essays or fan theories.

171
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,370
Subscribing to our slash empire did 
nothing wrong or re tweeting.

172
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,204
Lord palpatine in the age of pro-sumer 
ism every theory about where Luke was 

173
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,030
all this time,
who snuck his,

174
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:30,864
which Jeddah uses which light saber 
fighting styles is one way of 

175
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:38,190
contributing to the Star Wars universe.
It's a way for the community to practice

176
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,024
star wars.

177
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,133
Now imagine if you engage in your 
religious tradition in your community 

178
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,463
and all of the sudden the recently 
appointed Church authority tells you 

179
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,920
you're doing it all wrong.
The wafers are alive and while star wars

180
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,754
maybe the latest,
it isn't the only franchise open to 

181
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,810
legitimation crises within their 
communities.

182
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,823
Pro symbolism is beginning to affect the
relations between fans and producers 

183
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,900
even scaring away.
James Mangold,

184
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,734
director of Logan,
who recently tweeted at the point when 

185
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:04,554
work writing and directing big 
franchises has become the emotionally 

186
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:07,944
loaded equivalent of writing a new 
chapter of the Bible with the probable 

187
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,050
danger of being stoned and called a 
blast femur.

188
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,130
Then a lot of bolter minds are going to 
leave these films to hacks and corporate

189
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:17,964
boards.
So is the star wars system about to 

190
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,770
collapse under the weight of its crisis?
Not necessarily.

191
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,693
The Catholic Church obviously didn't 
crumble under there legitimation hiccup 

192
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:30,780
and maybe star wars won't either because
the thing is systems learn.

193
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,360
After a few Vatican council's and papel 
death,

194
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,253
the Catholic Church managed to revise 
some of the violent theology and really 

195
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,720
solidified the community under common 
goals and shared beliefs.

196
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,470
Sure there were Protestants who totally 
pieced out and started their own thing.

197
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,250
But in general the system learned,
adjusted and stayed intact.

198
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,323
So the question is,
which direction will the star wars 

199
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:52,830
system take?
We'll Disney find a way to evolve in the

200
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:53,664
time of prosumer ism,
respecting their fans and the universe 

201
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,400
they've helped create.
Will fans choose to grow with the system

202
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,220
and find new ways of interacting with 
their beloved material?

203
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,430
Or will there be a reckoning where 
Disney in the fans part,

204
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,264
ways like the Catholics and Protestants 
each starting their own version of the 

205
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,460
religion and competing for the souls of 
viewers.

206
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,803
Let us know what you guys think.
And if you enjoyed our take on the star 

207
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,180
wars crisis and I highly recommend 
checking out our friends over at Cheddar

208
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,163
the recently launched their own youtube 
channel and are cranking out awesome 

209
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,074
videos that cover business,
tech media and news without the boring 

210
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:27,360
parts from the inside scoop on the 
latest news stories,

211
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,194
too detailed answers or even the most 
ambiguous questions Cheddar has got you 

212
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:31,980
covered.

213
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,813
Gender also produces videos that examine
the triumphs and failures of the media 

214
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:36,804
we enjoy.
So I just watched their video on how 

215
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:42,090
bankrupt marvel risked its main 
characters to save itself as suggest.

216
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:42,924
You guys check it out too.
So they give you an inside look at how 

217
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,294
marvel went from filing bankruptcy in 
1996 to making James Cameron quiver on 

218
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,330
his throne of shattered box office 
records.

219
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,283
So watch the video and perhaps you'll a 
new hope that Disney can redeem the 

220
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,090
beloved star wars franchise.
