7
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:23,681
Jared again here to ask you a question.
Why are a repetitive Sitcom intro and an

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:24,724
Ode to British Children's television?
Two of the most disturbing things on 

9
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:28,834
youtube besides the obvious,
is there a reason that this or this is 

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,783
more unsettling than say a dude who 
murders you in your dreams instead of 

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,940
cheap jump scares.
Too many cooks and don't hug me.

12
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:42,730
I'm scared into a kind of existential 
horror,

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,743
but two different ends.
So if you've ever pondered the eternal 

14
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:47,134
question of whether you'd rather be 
stuck in a song that never ends or an 

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,320
acid induced muppet nightmare,
then this is the video for you.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,040
Welcome this wise crack condition on too
many cooks versus don't hug me.

17
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,410
I'm scared.
And I guess spoilers ahead.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,150
For those of you who don't know,
here's a quick recap.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,980
Too many cooks begins like the opening 
credits of most 80 sitcoms,

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,780
like full house,
different strokes or my two dads,

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,130
and then just keeps going.
As the jingle repeats,

22
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:13,964
the opening credits mutate and begin to 
resemble things ranging from Gi Joe to 

23
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,850
Battlestar Galactica and it keeps going

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,320
and going and going,

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,980
and a serial killer shows up and look.
If you haven't seen it,

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,690
go watch it.
It's so good.

27
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,883
Don't hug me.
I'm scared as a six episode web series 

28
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:38,750
that resembles British children's 
television shows like the teletubbies,

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,730
but each episode quickly descends into 
terrifying psychological torture,

30
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,623
complete with cultish fees.
This embezzlement and uncomfortable 

31
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,314
amounts of raw meat,
although they don't seem terribly 

32
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,314
similar,
both utilize a special nightmare sauce 

33
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,314
that really gets under our skin that 
sauce king with nostalgia in too many 

34
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,714
cooks.
The aesthetic of the comforting TV 

35
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:05,510
families of the eighties and nineties 
are quite literally murdered while in.

36
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,680
Don't hug me,
I'm scared.

37
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,430
Our childhood mentors are inverted into 
orwellian despots,

38
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,060
but what makes this worse than say,
watching nightmare.

39
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:14,894
On Elm Street,
you see nostalgia offers three 

40
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,804
psychological benefits.
It acts as a repository for positive 

41
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,640
feelings,
a contributor to self esteem,

42
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,730
and as a method of social connectivity 
because who hasn't read all 52 ways,

43
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:31,460
you know you're a nineties kid,
since nostalgia makes us feel so good,

44
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,383
disrupting it can really mess with your 
head according to one school of thought 

45
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:36,494
called terror management theory,
nostalgia can be a handy way to combat 

46
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:44,420
the terror of our mortal existence,
no longer able to take comfort in God or

47
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:45,230
an afterlife.

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,220
Our secular age has put more emphasis on
other kinds of immortality,

49
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,740
like having kids,
making your mark on the world,

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,700
having a national identity or having 
your Dick cast and plaster.

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,550
This is where nostalgia comes in.
At 2006,

52
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,384
study found nostalgia helps to provide 
meaning in our lives by allowing us to 

53
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:07,270
relive idealized memories of our past in
order to feel better about the future,

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,493
but unlike some media that shamelessly 
parrots nostalgia to give us the warm 

55
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:14,020
and fuzzies.
Too many cooks and don't hug me.

56
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:14,854
I'm scared.
Using this to log references to draw us 

57
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,554
in and then give us a good old fashioned
mind rather than dressing up like 

58
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,560
ghostbusters.
Too many cooks and don't hug me.

59
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,394
I'm scared over.
Identify with these references to the 

60
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:30,400
point of absurdity.
They use the sappy intro music.

61
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,234
Too many cooks dated retro graphics and 
simple puppets with bright colors to 

62
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,924
pull you into a nostalgic state and then
under my so when everything goes to 

63
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,140
hell,
they're literally ruining your childhood

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,970
and not like the last jet I did.

65
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,063
The nostalgic fuel,
good memories that pacify you on your 

66
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,124
meaningless trudge toward death are now 
being murdered both metaphorically and 

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,073
literally,
but while both these properties utilize 

68
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,804
this subversion of nostalgia,
it's how and why they subverted that 

69
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:05,710
sets them apart to understand what sets 
too many cooks apart from.

70
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,850
Don't hug me,
I'm scared.

71
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,000
We need to look at the Early Twentieth 
Century Theater Practitioner,

72
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,600
Bertolt Brecht,
Brecht rejected realism and theater.

73
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,240
Arguing that because film was so much 
better at it,

74
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,800
why even bother theater doesn't have the
endless takes multiple locations,

75
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,634
camera angles,
and perfectly mixed audio that puts you 

76
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,394
in the moment the way cinema does.
Theater requires a lot of suspension of 

77
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,354
disbelief and audience imagination,
so breck developed what he called epic 

78
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,914
theater.
Epic theater sought to disrupt the 

79
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,524
audience performer relationship where 
traditional drama expected an audience 

80
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,514
to be sad when the protagonist is sad,
frightened when he or she is frightened 

81
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,600
and so on.

82
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,523
Brecht wanted an audience to view the 
performance more critically and 

83
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,000
dispassionately.
To do that,

84
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,720
he used a technique called distantiation
or the alienation effect.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,793
For instance,
he would show the workings of their 

86
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:58,600
performance on stage to reveal its 
falseness in his play,

87
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,960
mother courage and her children.
Costume changes happen on stage.

88
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,823
Props and scenery are brought on and off
during dialog and placards are held up 

89
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,230
to explain the action.
Also,

90
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,064
the audience can't escape the awareness 
that they were watching a play and thus 

91
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,950
are able to judge the characters more 
critically.

92
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,520
Old birdie basically patented our 
culture's favorite thing,

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,563
breaking the fourth wall like Brecht.
Too many cooks draws our attention to 

94
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,704
its own falseness.
Characters run between sets that are 

95
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:26,754
stocked by their Chiron's.
The audio and video are disrupted and 

96
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,750
whatever.
This is another characteristic.

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,150
Too many cooks shares with Brecht is 
repetition.

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,193
In almost every Brecht play,
there is a form of repeated dance 

99
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,610
movement,
gesture or phrase,

100
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,130
even in the music.
Consider the Alabama sauce,

101
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,310
which you might recognize.
It's an awesome song by the doors.

102
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,260
Well,
Brecht wrote the lyrics.

103
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:54,220
Rhythm and instrumentation are highly 
repetitive and the harmony uses a lot of

104
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,054
dissonance to achieve the general 
feeling of creepiness on bestows upon 

105
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,084
the listener,
and if you two are creeped out by the 

106
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,270
song,
then congrats,

107
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,080
Brex alienation effect work.
The more you repeat something,

108
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:09,890
the more likely you are to look at or to
listen to it critically.

109
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,843
Seeing it a different way like have you 
ever repeated a word until it sounds 

110
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,710
like gibberish?
Just like saying,

111
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,000
pigeon pigeon,
pigeon,

112
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,834
pigeon for a minute straight,
we'll make the word pigeon sound 

113
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,680
extremely weird.
Hearing the phrase,

114
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,543
too many cooks over and over throughout 
and 11 minute video will remove any and 

115
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,460
all meaning the phrase too many cooks 
ever had,

116
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,503
but were Brecht would often use this 
distancing effect to explain an 

117
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,220
injustice or challenge or prejudice.

118
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,550
Too many cooks has a much more 
nihilistic view of the whole thing.

119
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,990
Every component of popular entertainment
is distance and robbed of meaning.

120
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,240
For instance,
the repetitiveness of the phrase,

121
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,074
too many cooks spoil the broth seems to 
parallel the repetition of other Sitcom 

122
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,790
catchphrases like,
hey,

123
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,780
even as more and more unsettling 
elements are introduced,

124
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,650
the repetition renders it all 
meaningless and uses this opportunity to

125
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,120
show how interchangeable at all is as 
our characters get murdered are greasy.

126
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,954
Serial killer begins to inhabit the 
generic and interchangeable tropes and 

127
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,584
aesthetics of television.
By deconstructing these old shows in 

128
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:16,490
this graphic way too many cooks up ends.
Any attempt at terror management through

129
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,324
our nostalgic love of he-man married 
with children or buck rogers by 

130
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,044
revealing them to be empty,
easily replicated junk all for a joke 

131
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,050
and a great one at that.
Don't hug me,

132
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:27,884
I'm scared.
Use this a lot of these same techniques 

133
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,344
of distantiation to like breaking the 
fourth wall by rotating a digital image 

134
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,580
of their set and repeating camera moves 
and dialogue over and over.

135
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,680
I wonder what will happen,

136
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,400
but

137
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,390
don't hug me.
I'm scared.

138
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:48,050
Has more in common with a different type
of pop culture deconstruction.

139
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,140
Whereas too many cooks is deconstruction
for its own sake.

140
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,360
Don't hug me.
Subverts nostalgia too.

141
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,670
Not only criticized children's 
television,

142
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,270
but to offer a way forward,
but how exactly.

143
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,343
Well,
first we need to talk about something 

144
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,330
that sounds really boring.
The British television act of 1954,

145
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,343
which allowed commercial television 
networks to compete with the publicly 

146
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,450
owned BBC.
Following the television act,

147
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,313
a new commercial channel called 
Independent Television was created in 

148
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:18,230
1955.
A fact not lost on.

149
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,064
Don't hug me.
I'm scared in the Erie fundraising 

150
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,310
campaign.
Trailers,

151
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,233
a violent bear monster demands money 
from the audience using a ransom video 

152
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,630
conspicuously timestamp as 1955.
With this in mind,

153
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:36,560
the reason for deconstructing children's
television becomes a bit clearer.

154
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,980
Subtle clues,
take jabs at the very idea of children's

155
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:44,300
television for profit or even profit in 
general throughout it's six episodes.

156
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:46,310
The three main characters,
red guy,

157
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,060
duck and yellow guy are terrorized by 
different guest teachers,

158
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,310
like a notebook that explains 
creativity.

159
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,550
What's your favorite ice is being 
creative,

160
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,493
a clock that explains time.
Time is a tool you can put on the wall 

161
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:04,520
or wherever it on your wrist.
The past is far behind us.

162
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,250
The future doesn't exist.
Nap Ap,

163
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,080
that explains love for some reason.

164
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,770
Together we get understanding

165
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,250
on the surface.
This seems like any episode of Barney or

166
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,143
whatever kids watch these days,
but as the fourth wall starts to 

167
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:20,380
dissolve,
everything gets weird.

168
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,910
Herder is trippy and even profound.
One could argue that this bat,

169
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,883
it insanity and the unexpected guys have
a kids show is been to expose the 

170
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,124
authoritarian and consumerists messages 
using a method known as culture jamming 

171
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,163
culture.
Jamming is a tactic used by anti 

172
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:37,434
consumer as groups to subvert the 
dominant narrative and iconography of 

173
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,104
our era,
mainstream media advertisements and so 

174
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,610
on.
This means revealing the message that is

175
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:46,444
quote,
really behind popular media and 

176
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:51,770
advertising and injecting their own 
meaning to serve their agenda.

177
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,280
I think of the coke billboard that says 
love,

178
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,920
but someone spray painted profit 
underneath it,

179
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,500
or a Mcdonald's billboard modified to 
read.

180
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm loving diabetes or anything banks 
he's ever done or vermin supreme,

181
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,103
a man who wears a boot on his head and 
wants to mandate brushing your teeth by 

182
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,900
law all to mark our political process.

183
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,620
This election year,
vote early,

184
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,110
vote often.
I remember a vote for me,

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,310
vermin supreme.
It was about completely thrown away.

186
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,253
This method of deconstructing a well 
known institution like children's 

187
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,424
television by jamming it with another 
more graphic image highlights the 

188
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:25,384
disparity between wholesome edutainment 
for kids and the excesses of profit 

189
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:33,190
driven media that the television act 
introduced throughout the series.

190
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,540
The teachers in every episode explain 
what something is or means,

191
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,360
but start to suggest better ways of 
doing things.

192
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,030
Could you're not thinking creatively

193
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,440
correct.
The main characters.

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,620
It's not by name.
If you can do it.

195
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,950
Oh,
they did,

196
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,980
and punish them if they do or say what 
the teachers see as the wrong thing.

197
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,050
Wanting to be creative.
Don't use green.

198
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,750
That's not a creative color.
One.

199
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,320
Eat fancy foods.
Sorry.

200
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,460
They'll clog up your body.

201
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,990
Ten feet.
Foods are very rude.

202
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,030
I must leave through the cat flap.

203
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,203
While these choices of excluding green 
or choosing a computer over a globe to 

204
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,080
learn may seem inane and meaningless at 
first,

205
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,660
they slowly begin to reveal what is at 
stake.

206
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,643
These saccharin notion of a child's TV 
mentor is jammed to reveal the dangers 

207
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:28,384
of letting media teacher child in the 
harsh realities of the commercial age 

208
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,523
and the touch of authoritarianism that 
is inherent to it all attempts to 

209
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,750
question their teachers are always shut 
down.

210
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,440
It doesn't make sense.
Let me just.

211
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,180
A construct of human perception and 
illusion created by.

212
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,823
Furthermore,
the danger of empty platitudes about 

213
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:52,160
love devolve into a cult.

214
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,263
His name is

215
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,160
age.
They can't get loud.

216
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,133
Optimism about technology is juxtaposed 
with some clockwork orange in the 

217
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,304
computer episode.
What you do with a computer seems to be 

218
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:07,490
dancing graphs and more importantly,
style as in,

219
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
you know,
buying clothes.

220
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,213
Wow.

221
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,993
The last few episodes even seemed to 
drop hints that this is all a plan to 

222
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:20,414
sell oats to kids.
Our computer teacher asks the puppets a 

223
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:23,834
series of questions like it's for a 
focus group and on the question of what 

224
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:27,464
do you like to eat?
Our beloved computer shows us another 

225
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,790
picture of oats.
In the next episode,

226
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:36,200
Our teacher tells us the merits of plain
foods and more oats are seen next to the

227
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,610
healthy juice.
This gives.

228
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:38,660
Don't hug me.
I'm scared.

229
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:39,494
A much more moral message than too many 
cooks while too many cooks literally 

230
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,660
self destructs the message of,
don't hug me.

231
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:45,610
I'm scared.
Instead,

232
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,780
alternate methods of childhood 
education.

233
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,763
Try managing your terror with that.
Just like almost everything else in pop 

234
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:53,810
culture right now.
Too many cooks and don't hug me.

235
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:54,644
I'm scared.
Recognize how we use nostalgia as a 

236
00:12:56,481 --> 00:13:00,690
safety blanket and then soak that 
blanket in blood and rip a few holes in,

237
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,843
but while too many cooks says that's 
because this kind of nostalgic is a lie 

238
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,260
and ultimately useless.

239
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,490
Don't hug me.
I'm scared.

240
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:08,324
Ruins our childhood because it loves us.
It wants you to challenge the lessons 

241
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:15,110
you've learned instead of blindly 
obeying that comforting kids.

242
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,120
Show voice.
So do me a favor.

243
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,470
Don't listen to these smooth voice of 
video host and think for yourself.

244
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,323
All right,
thanks for watching a wise crack piece 

245
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,110
and a huge thanks to hymns for 
sponsoring this video.

246
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,003
If you're like me,
you only go to the doctor every other 

247
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,590
decade.
In fact,

248
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,453
18 to 40 year old men are less likely 
than any other group to visit a doctor 

249
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:35,504
or a pharmacy.
Luckily Hims is your one stop solution 

250
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,250
for potentially awkward men's health 
issues.

251
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,323
Yeah,
I'm talking about going bald acne and 

252
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,270
yeah,
I'm going to say it.

253
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,193
Penis problems,
it happens basically all the things you 

254
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:47,654
try to hide on tinder,
but these conditions are as normal as 

255
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:54,400
they are treatable and hymns takes your 
privacy seriously through hims.

256
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,440
You'll get personalized recommendations 
from medical grade products,

257
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:01,580
from real doctors and with the doctors.
Awesome virtual visits online.

258
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,430
You never have to get off the couch or 
turn off your ps four.

259
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,790
While I've been blessed with a full head
of very thick hair,

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,030
at least for now,
you don't have to lose yours and because

261
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:15,020
hymns offers generic equivalents to name
brand prescriptions and ships direct,

262
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,973
you're getting major savings.
Hims is offering wisecrack viewers a
