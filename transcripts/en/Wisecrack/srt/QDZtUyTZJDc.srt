00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,660
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

2
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,790
I am your host.
Garrick's were ameloid.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,200
This week's artifact is jaws directed by
the wonder kid himself.

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,123
Stephen wonder.
The film follows police officer John 

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,873
Brody.
The town's only lifeguard when a shark 

6
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,290
rocks a girl back and forth until she 
dies.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,500
He tries to close down the beach so it 
can't get to land,

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,300
but the mayor's deepen the pocket of 
sustainable local business that crook,

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,380
the mayor's plan works for five minutes 
until the shark eats chucky.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,513
Naturally,
the town decides the safest solution is 

11
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,900
for everyone to just try and kill it 
themselves,

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,883
but not quint,
an actual shark hunter with a resume 

13
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:51,914
longer than his nails.
Brody brings on a brilliant scientist 

14
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:57,230
named hooper who offers his professional
opinion.

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,203
It was a shark.
The next day the fishermen catch dinner 

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,110
and the mayor opens the beach,
but who bird calls bullshit.

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,200
Since this sharks belly has an airtight 
alibi and said,

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,970
you still got a hell of a fish out there
on England day,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,720
some kids pull a hilarious prank while 
the shark pulls one of his own.

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,680
Oh wait.
And with no options left.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,090
The capitalist mayor is forced to hire 
quince and turn the town Communist.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,560
What follows is a human male getaway on 
a boat for the weekend full of fishing,

23
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,423
drinking,
and terrifying monologues about 

24
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:30,824
subtraction.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,840
So 1100 men when they were 16 and come 
out of the sharks took the rest.

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,600
It's so fun.
Even the shark can't stay away.

27
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,840
And the trio try throwing barrels at it 
like it's Mario,

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,750
even though its name is Dennis.
They hook the shark,

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,900
but their boat conveniently breaks down 
just like me.

30
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,180
Anytime I watched the fault in our 
quarks,

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,343
hooper tries to put it in a cage,
but ends up getting in himself the goof 

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,520
while Quinn tries kicking it,
remembering he's a policeman.

33
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,443
Brody shoots Dennis until he explodes.
Jaws Herald and the age of Hollywood 

34
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,384
blockbusters,
which always got there do come award 

35
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,624
season.
It's got everything a human with eyes 

36
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,054
could want from its merchandise tie-ins 
to it's complex to notes score to its 

37
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,724
high concept.
Premise high because you have to be 

38
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:20,964
stoned to think of this for reasons 
unknown to our archeologists earthlings 

39
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,660
met this film with immense amounts of 
critical thoughts.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,873
Uh,
first for the species through a Marxist 

41
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,374
Lens.
Amities devastation can be viewed as 

42
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:36,870
retribution for capitalism,
a disease that made humans rich.

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,330
Well,
a few of them early on.

44
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,164
The film shows how the economic 
interests of amities business owners 

45
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,790
trump the needs of the common people.

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I had a point of view and I think it 
speaks for many of the motel.

47
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,014
How do you feel?

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,190
Even though the common folk can't count

49
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,920
[inaudible]

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,940
the mayor refuses to band swimming.
It would hurt the town's bottom line.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
While you've Brodie is similarly 
preoccupied with this rich dude sick 

52
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:05,460
house.

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,290
I know you got a lot of founders 
downtown,

54
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
but I've got a couple of problems with 
the house or was she could take care of 

55
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,163
one.
I've got some cats parking in front of 

56
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,204
the house.
I can

57
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,350
lifeguard and handyman.
Well doesn't this cop do,

58
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,880
but ignoring the pleas of the common 
folk nearly ruins the town after Dennis,

59
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,340
his reign of terror claims various 
humans,

60
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,920
boats,
horses and boat porches.

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,700
The mayor finally allows brody hooper 
and quint to go kill the shark,

62
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,700
even though they could have done it on 
their own at any time.

63
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,863
This echoes marks belief that capitalism
will ultimately be overthrown by the 

64
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,790
unhappy masses on a beach.
This transition of power cures Amedee of

65
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,580
its capitalist hangover so it can get 
back to drinking.

66
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,803
At the same time,
jaws can be viewed more broadly as a 

67
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:51,790
metaphor for corrupt government,
also known as government.

68
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,923
Indeed,
the film offered American earthlings a 

69
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,154
way to vent their frustration with 
politicians in the wake of Watergate 

70
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:58,894
gate and this interpretation the mayor 
stands in for Nixon sharing his famous 

71
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,200
distrust for law enforcement or the 
fellas.

72
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,643
Let's be reasonable,
half his pension for covering up 

73
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,430
incriminating evidence.

74
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,300
What else could have done that to that 
girl?

75
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,040
Bulk of ballet?
Well,

76
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,630
I think possibly,
yes,

77
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,540
call me over the phone

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,320
and his nautical themed suits when he's 
publicly disgraced.

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,183
The audience experiences well-deserved 
relief just as the American people did 

80
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,460
when Nixon resigned from office to live 
on the moon.

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,190
If psychology is more your cup of herb 
water,

82
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,160
jaws can be read as a Freudian 
cautionary tale.

83
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,920
It's all psychological.
Freud posited,

84
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:39,050
there were three sections to the human 
brain.

85
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,860
The ID in charge of animal desires,
the Super Ego,

86
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,180
which controls morality and the Eggo,
which balances a healthy breakfast.

87
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,150
Dennis represents the primal desires of 
the ID,

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,170
driven to consume things both 
figuratively and literally.

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,840
The town and it's government or the 
Superego,

90
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,630
imposing laws ostensibly for the greater
good.

91
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,360
And the Eggo is where these two forces 
meet,

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,150
usually the shore.
But here,

93
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,984
the balance has broken down rather than 
finding the line between mindless 

94
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:12,740
consumption and moral snobbery,
the aid runs wild baby.

95
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,610
It's only when brody kills the shark 
that harmony corrine is restored,

96
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,420
symbolized by him standing in a boat,
half submerged in water,

97
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,523
where he'll eventually drown.
But the prevailing interpretation comes 

98
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:27,170
from filmmaker Stephen wonder who 
astutely proclaimed.

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,880
It's a movie about a shark named Dennis 
for earthlink cinema.

100
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,580
I'm Derek's warm,
and if you haven't heard,

101
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:38,810
