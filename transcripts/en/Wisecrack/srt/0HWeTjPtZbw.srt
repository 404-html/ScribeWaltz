1
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,893
It's hard to give money away.
Sometimes that's the worst thing it 

2
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:15,830
could do,
but I mean,

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,730
I would look to say the gates 
foundation,

4
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:21,150
which now has 60 billions of dollars to 
give away,

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,013
how are they doing it?
And I think they're going about it 

6
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,144
rather wisely.
I mean they have put processes in place 

7
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,464
and objectives in place and they're 
targeting certain things in certain 

8
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,634
parts of the world that would appear to 
be at first some of the lowest hanging 

9
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,320
fruit.
Some of the things that,

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,213
uh,
need to be done that might have the 

11
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,950
greatest leverage for us to move forward
looking at things like population growth

12
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,784
and demec disease,
a corruption and try to apply it in a 

13
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:57,241
ways that the money gets handed to 
people who are responsible for it,

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,783
uh,

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,510
using techniques that seem to be proven 
to be effective.

16
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,030
Hundreds of billions of dollars have 
already been wasted.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,970
Get people giving money away.
But at the same time,

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,430
when people say aid doesn't work,
I mean,

19
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:13,400
that's really not true because a lot of 
a's does work.

20
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,234
You can just look at some of the money 
that's been spent on recently for 

21
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,414
eliminating simple things like malaria 
and other diseases and there's been a 

22
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:21,980
lot of ways too,

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,453
uh,

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,530
how effectively do that.
And certainly we should learn from that.

25
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:32,310
And there's plenty of smart people 
working on exactly this and there are,

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,000
there would be ways to give away 
$100,000,000,000,

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,570
although I'm sure you wouldn't do it all
in a,

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,790
you wouldn't do it all at once.
