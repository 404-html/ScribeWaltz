1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,813
Taking shots for anybody who may have 
been in a position of where he's just 

2
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,360
one vote.
Granted the bigger vote getter,

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,960
the biggest voter on the FMC is that,
you know,

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,933
we all were sitting in a world again 
where we thought certain things were 

5
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:23,694
going to happen and not happen.
And clearly when you Monday morning 

6
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,470
quarterback somebody might say,
well,

7
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:29,304
we should have raised rates a little 
more quickly and made money a little 

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,330
less cheap and I would be one of those 
that would say that today.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,790
But when you sat there were making those
decisions,

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,791
I'm not sure that coming out of the 2000
tech bust and going through,

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,803
you know,
nine slash 11 and then having the Iraq 

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,723
war come up in the Afghan war that,
that you wouldn't have had a bit of a 

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,650
conservative view towards how rapidly 
you do that.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,800
Uh,
so clearly in hindsight you'd say,

15
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,350
yes,
we should have made money less cheap.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,170
But again,
I think to blame the Federal Reserve for

17
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:07,970
what human beings are doing individually
is,

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,190
is a bit of a stretch.
You know,

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,033
one thing we've done in our company that
is a direct reaction to this is that we 

20
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,160
actually have written into our equity 
and bonus plans now,

21
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,570
we just did it this year that if there 
is a material misstatement or financials

22
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,404
is that we're going to recapture from 
the executives the money we just gave 

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,180
because I thought it was just horrible 
what happened,

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,280
not because of any of the right to 
collect it,

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,020
but these guys walked away when their 
firms went and had a lot of suffering.

26
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,630
I don't want that to happen on my watch.
Doesn't mean we can't make mistakes,

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,410
but I think you're going to start see 
compensation plans also alter,

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,483
but that's a free market force that 
wasn't imposed by any government is 

29
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:51,480
boards will do that.

30
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,403
Our board was very receptive to it.
You happen to have a management team 

31
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,704
that wanted to do it and they saw 
something in the news they didn't like 

32
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:03,240
and they change things.
So through a combination of changes from

33
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:07,200
the Federal Reserve combination of state
implementing laws,

34
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,150
I think we'll get some of this behind 
us.

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,860
And I also think that what's remarkable 
is to think that you could have a war,

36
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:14,694
you could have nine slash 11,
you could have all these things happen 

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,040
where the global economy is still able 
to absorb it.

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,383
And until very recently,
main street wasn't suffering like Wall 

39
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:24,744
Street was.
So our economy is still very robust and 

40
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,540
I think it'll still end up being,
even with this tremendous impact.

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,940
Um,
it'll take awhile,

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,340
but I still think we're in.
We're going to end up in a good place at

43
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,183
the end of the day.
