1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,340
I want to read a passage,
it's almost a monologue.

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,860
Um,
after the murder of this,

3
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:15,170
uh,
this kid in the lower east side.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,723
Um,
the whole communities kind of turned 

5
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:23,140
upside down looking for the shooters.
And um,

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,283
one of the people who didn't get the 
message that he's not supposed to live 

7
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:31,691
in the lower east side anymore is this 
junkie who,

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,770
uh,
sees a crime,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,233
a crime of opportunity and snatches a 
bag in front of Schiller's and tries to 

10
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,620
get away with it.
And a,

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,670
he gets grabbed by the bouncer and a 
first thing he says in a panic is,

12
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,390
let me go and I'll tell you your shot,
that white kid.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,883
And so they have to track him down in 
the middle of the night to see the 

14
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,390
catching detective.
Who's this guy,

15
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,980
Mattie Clark,
the,

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,890
the two cops in this scene,
or Mattie Clark.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,830
And there's a guy named Iacono who's 
another cop who basically lives in,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,550
in the windowless bunk room,
has been for six months,

19
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,370
comes out every once in a while and a 
toothbrush,

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,071
shower,
clogs,

21
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:09,380
and does police work and then goes back 
into the bunk room.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,903
So this is about three o'clock in the 
morning and this is taking place in an 

23
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:15,434
interview room in a seventh precinct.
The city less to Kaufman said one knee 

24
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:21,884
crossed over the other,
a cuffed hand dangling languidly from 

25
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,930
the restraint bar.
People are doing so well,

26
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:28,180
you know,
but you can't,

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,890
can't ask them for shit anymore.
It's never been so bad.

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,713
Maddie grunted and sympathy the balance.
I had told them that the first thing 

29
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:36,674
this guy had said when he grabbed him 
after the attempted purse snatching in 

30
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,690
front of Berchmans was,
let me go and I'll tell you,

31
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,510
shot that white kid.
I swam man.

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,630
Less to said to Maddy for the 10th time 
in the last half hour,

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,003
I just said that like in a panic,
like the first thing that came into my 

34
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,150
head,
what's left in my head.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,033
Unfortunately mattie believed him.
Lester yawned like ally and revealing 

36
00:01:58,431 --> 00:01:58,840
adults.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,673
Steel Ball Pierce through his tone.
I a cone rouse from sleep for this you 

38
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,170
owned in response,
but I'll tell you man,

39
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:09,350
I'm really worried about my girlfriend.
I gave her $100 to get me something.

40
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,250
You know,
get me well,

41
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,490
she said 15 minutes and left me standing
at three hours.

42
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:16,370
I had no idea where she went.
What happened to a 15 minutes?

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,350
I mean,
I never would've done that if she didn't

44
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,184
lead me to at like half the night 
watching everybody come in and out of 

45
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,654
that place for smokes drunk or drunk and
half the damn bags right on the 

46
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:27,020
sidewalk.
Another titanic yawn.

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,190
The delta,
the tongue.

48
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:32,750
Pierce winking sucks.
I Cohen said strap for a partner.

49
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:36,230
Maddie had cajoled him out of the bunk 
room with the promise of overtime and an

50
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:38,030
easy commute.
I mean,

51
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm fucked,
I know it,

52
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,280
but can you just check your computer?

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
See if she's in the system.
I'm hoping she got college.

54
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,530
Nothing worse,
but what's her name?

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,150
Anita Castro or colony.
Elvis.

56
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,830
I colon rose and went to the screen on 
Yolanda's desk.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,540
Rich,
you get $100 Leicester Man.

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,490
He asked where he shifted then coughed 
into his fist.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,793
Oh Man.
You don't want to make extra work for 

60
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,490
yourself with questions like that.
No,

61
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,130
seriously.
Maddie,

62
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,770
let it slide.
Nothing I cold called out.

63
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,690
You.
Did you check Brooklyn?

64
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,340
No,
just Manhattan.

65
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,250
Could you check Brooklyn?
She scores on south second south third.

66
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,590
No one scores in Manhattan anymore.
My Net and is dead.

67
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:21,010
You guys took care of that Lester.
He crossed his knees.

68
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,844
A slice of grimy red,
long John Peeking out between his Pale 

69
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,460
blue ankle and the cuff of his jeans.
I mean,

70
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,294
what the hell happened to us?
She was going to take me to the 

71
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,090
hospital.
I have fluid in my lungs.

72
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,790
That's no problem.
We'll get someone to take you as soon as

73
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,290
we're finished.
Nothing.

74
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,210
I called and called out.
She got a third name.

75
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,160
She's not in the system,
Huh?

76
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,140
Jesus.
What do you think happened to her?

77
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,350
He asked Meti and me here.
This is a felony to right?

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,530
Not necessarily.
It depends how you say what you say.

79
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,090
You know visa vi,
sincerity.

80
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,950
Remorse.
I am remorseful.

81
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,360
I didn't miss.
I didn't threaten.

82
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,160
I didn't see anything.
What's a terroristic?

83
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,590
Alright,
just capture that and your statement.

84
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,760
In fact,
if you want,

85
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,740
we can even write your statement for 
you,

86
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,993
but less than,
what can I tell you that you haven't 

87
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,390
heard a million times before?
You help us.

88
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,970
We help you take this could go down as a
pet law.

89
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,223
I just,
I don't even want to pick the fucking 

90
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,204
thing up off the sidewalk.
I don't even think anybody was going to 

91
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,800
notice when that big black guy started 
running after me.

92
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,660
I was like,
he had taken and didn't even get to open

93
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,620
a damn thing.
I have no idea what was in.

94
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:23,020
Now obviously I'm not a pro at this now.
Now don't get down on yourself.

95
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,900
I Cohen said from Yolanda's desk,
you know,

96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,650
I got to say right now we're pretty much
eating out of garbage cans.

97
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,140
Me and Anita would,
a few years ago we had a store with like

98
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,450
$200,000
Oh yeah,

99
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,713
Matt,
he's turned to you and what kind of 

100
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,740
store?
It was like a punk boutique.

101
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,530
No kidding.
Can I have a cigarette?

102
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,510
Geez,
I got to get to the emergency room.

103
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,610
All right.
Mandy clapped his hands.

104
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:46,444
Here we go.
One time offer the hell would the guys 

105
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,080
who shot that kid just give us a stickup
team.

106
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,120
Just some names.
Anybody you know works the hood.

107
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,430
They check out.
Not only do you get a pass here,

108
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,650
but we take you to the Er,
get you squared away.

109
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,340
Then we go look for your girl.
A stickup team.

110
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,380
Let's just shrugged.
Recrossed crossed his legs,

111
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,790
looked away.
You know,

112
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,743
she used to use Carmen Lopez.
That was like a professional name at 

113
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:10,990
this one place out in Massapequa.
She's a bod dance exotic.

114
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,220
Very good,
very popular.

115
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,063
Had a regular schedule like to see you.
And she could go to the houses summit 

116
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,340
and embargo 30 $40 but she's four months
pregnant now.

117
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,610
So resting is Brown.
The curve is freehand.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,430
I Dunno.
Maybe it's time to go upstate.

119
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,200
It's getting too hard out here.
You know,

120
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,143
that's it.
