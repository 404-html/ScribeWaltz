1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,400
I believe in the power of images.
I think,

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:03,780
uh,
I wouldn't be a photographer.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,980
I didn't believe in the power of images.
I think there's an immediacy to an image

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,940
that obviously text or writing doesn't 
have.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,290
They both are incredibly powerful tools,
but they hit you at different moments.

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,124
So an image that can speak to people 
really can bring them to that place or 

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,733
transport them to that moment of pain or
that moment of urgency or whatever that 

8
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,240
emotion is I'm trying to convey in that 
image.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,283
I think that an image has the ability to
take the viewer there immediately 

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,110
because sometimes,
uh,

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,230
I feel like a hunter,
like I feel like I walk into a scene and

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,404
I kind of look,
the first thing I do is look at the 

13
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,630
light and I figure out where is light 
interesting.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,240
Whereas the light source and where is it
falling?

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,650
And then I look at the expressions on 
people and their faces and I'm trying to

16
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,484
think about what is the story I'm trying
to tell or what is the story that's 

17
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,760
being conveyed to me?
And then I have to look for details.

18
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,594
I'm looking for sort of anything that 
might be interesting or might sort of 

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,200
convey a message and I often kind of 
circle around that seen several times,

20
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,970
so I'll look at it from the front,
from the side,

21
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:15,804
from the back.
I'll go around it a few times and see 

22
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,250
how the light changes.
If it's backlit,

23
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:24,660
if I'm shooting straight on and then 
often I'll shoot the hell out of it.

24
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,820
I mean I'll shoot it every which way I 
can.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,990
I'm kind of very unconventional and how 
I learned to compose pictures,

26
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,210
it was really trial and error.
So for me,

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,480
uh,
I'm often trying to fit a certain amount

28
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,314
of information into a frame.
I'm trying to tell a story with each 

29
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,914
picture.
So that has a lot to do with how I 

30
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,350
compose a picture and then I'm trying to
make it beautiful.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,140
Not only even if it's a horrible scene 
I'm trying to,

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,070
to sort of bring the viewer in and make 
them interested.

33
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,550
So I don't want to take something and 
make it so horrendous or,

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,840
or capture it in such a way that the 
first thing they do is turn the page.

35
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,520
I want to engage the viewer.
