1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,590
Can take off the role with the makeup 
and the costume.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,710
Um,
obviously if you've,

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,280
uh,
play player a bit,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,320
that has tremendous moment,
they know that doesn't just leave you.

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,570
I remember once actually was here on 
Broadway,

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,600
I was in Martin Sherman play bent,
which was an extraordinary love story.

7
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,750
Again,
a very daring and you know,

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,600
pushing the envelope drama about,
um,

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,870
homosexuals in a sent to a camp and I'm 
dark and dangerous.

10
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,810
But at the core of it,
this wonderful story,

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,870
human monetarian story of love between 
two unlikely man.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,280
Um,
great play.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,320
And One night there was a young girl at 
the stage door and uh,

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,160
she said,
uh,

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,993
oh,
I came to the play tonight with my 

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,380
mother and I and I,
she says,

17
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,323
my mother was in a concentration camp 
and under some of the things described 

18
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,600
in the play,
terrible things happen to her.

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,090
And I went cold.
I thought,

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
oh my God,
what is this girl going to say?

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,870
How dare you,
you know,

22
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:25,871
welfare act to trivialize or miss,
you know,

23
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,290
to reduce her experience,
her memories.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,450
Instead,
she said,

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,160
I'd just like to thank you.
She's,

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,920
my mother has never been able to talk 
about the experience.

27
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,310
But seeing the play was like a key.
It unlocked the experience for her.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,240
And she's talking about it for the first
time,

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,470
and I thought,
my God,

30
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:49,850
you know,
this is,

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,740
this is the drama.
As we said earlier,

32
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:54,980
going back to that,
it's Greek origins,

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,320
you know,
as being sort of sacred,

34
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,570
therapeutic,
uh,

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,830
experience.
And I thought,

36
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:01,251
well,
you know,

37
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,900
if I never do anything else,
then

38
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,440
this one night is valuable.
