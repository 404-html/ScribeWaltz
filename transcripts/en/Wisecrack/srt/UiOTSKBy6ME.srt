00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,003
Wisecrack jared here and today we're 
talking about a game that was seemingly 

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,104
made for us.
Perhaps the most overly philosophical 

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,391
game ever seen a specimen that shows 
quite near Automaton.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,470
Near Automaton is a game about three 
androids to be as in or not to be.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,920
The moody nine s and the jaded did a too
along the way.

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,754
They fight adorable button,
lethal machines and eventually each 

7
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,730
other on a futuristic earth where the 
line between right and wrong is taking a

8
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,564
vacation and is never coming back.
The world of New York automaton is 

9
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,404
crawling with machines named after 
philosophers who you must be friend or 

10
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,244
be head mostly the latter,
but these wisdom loving death bots 

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,770
aren't always just throw away 
characters.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,550
They often point toward the complex 
philosophy at the heart of the game,

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,623
at its core near Automata challenges,
players to consider how we make meaning 

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:55,110
and truth,
who we are as gamers and why video games

15
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:55,740
matter.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,160
Welcome with this wisecrack addition on 
the philosophy of near Automaton.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,173
This video was made in collaboration 
with an awesome channel called extra 

18
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,380
credits.
You could catch a link to them and their

this episode and if you're visiting us

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,990
Oh,
and watch out major spoilers ahead.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,050
The story takes place on earth more than
9,000

23
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,690
years in the future and follows two 
groups of Automaton.

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,390
There's androids designed to hold human 
consciousness,

25
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:25,560
but who eventually develop independent 
thought and machines were created by the

26
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,394
aliens that invaded earth.
Androids in machines fight a genocidal 

27
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,024
proxy war on behalf of their masters.
Though the player mostly controls 

28
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,684
android characters.
Choosing sides is not that easy because 

29
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,374
by the games halfway point we learned 
both humans and aliens have been dead 

30
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:43,200
for Millennia.
Humans were already extinct.

31
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,900
When the aliens attack absent their 
creators,

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,220
androids and machines are forced to make
meaning for themselves and if possible,

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
stop seeing each other as enemies.
The fact that both humans and aliens or 

34
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,104
dead is not only a central plot twist,
it encapsulates the games existential 

35
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,480
philosophy.
In fact,

36
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:01,710
two B's opening line.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,173
I often think about the God who blessed 
us with this cryptic puzzle and wonder 

38
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,180
if we'll ever have the chance to kill 
him.

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,490
Might

40
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,323
as well have been polled right from 
Friedrich Porn Stache Nisha who wrote 

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,480
God is dead.
God remains dead and we have killed him.

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,853
Now I know the phrase God is dead gets 
thrown around a lot by internet edge 

43
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,774
lords,
but what did Nisha actually mean before 

44
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,720
Nicha many thinkers constructed reality 
in a similar way.

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,610
God,
truth and reason,

46
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,860
we're all unfathomable,
unchanging,

47
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,540
and universal concepts which stood above
or outside of humankind,

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,160
like supernatural forces animating the 
world and moving it toward progress.

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,263
In this view,
humans don't make and control meaning 

50
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:48,460
themselves.
It's some unreachable datey or universal

51
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,900
principle which gives human action,
meaning when Nisha declared God dead,

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,793
he criticized any system that locates 
the source of meaning outside human 

53
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:57,934
lives and popularize the idea of 
nihilism is the belief that there is no 

54
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,824
great metaphysical forest propelling us 
through the world and making our lives 

55
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,160
special.

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,700
Existence can be beat and there's no 
grander meaning to comfort us.

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,623
No puppet master to save us.
Now I know we can find each other in a 

58
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,584
lot of pop culture,
but no piece of media embodies it quite 

59
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,610
like near Automaton.
Androids and machines think they're god,

60
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:24,220
like masters are literally above them on
the moon and in space,

61
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,600
but those gods are actually dead like 
rotting for Millennia,

62
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,700
dead and as we learned from Adam and 
eve,

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,840
machines killed their alien overlords 
because they were static and unchanging,

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,590
much like the unchanging day at ease and
morals that nature criticized.

65
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,460
They were saying almost like

66
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,210
humans died after the mainframe holding 
their consciousnesses collapses.

67
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,283
Guess nobody made backups.
If the death of God is really about the 

68
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:58,770
death of a grand meaning,
then our dead aliens and humans are only

69
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,604
one element of the games.
Greater message about meaning you kill 

70
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,110
some a philosophies,
biggest heroes.

71
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,003
Some characters lose sight of a purpose 
in life and the game repeatedly builds 

72
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:12,510
meaning around certain characters or 
plots and then kills them off usually by

73
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,850
the player's own hand.
Each time this happens,

74
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:15,684
the player has to reevaluate where their
new meaning mission and direction is 

75
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,884
going to come from.
Even your hobby android organization 

76
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,304
eventually dies,
but your highs less like a god and more 

77
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:28,500
like acd government.
They know humanities dead,

78
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,080
but hide it from the other androids 
pretty fucked up,

79
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:31,914
right?
Your hot perfectly exemplifies the 

80
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,374
Nietzschean point that even once God,
six feet under society doesn't just 

81
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:38,970
reboot.
Political.

82
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:39,804
Social and psychological norms are left 
over from prior belief systems and we 

83
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:44,214
continue imposing these meanings on one 
another and ourselves to be at nine s 

84
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,120
spend much of the b play throughs,
reassuring one another.

85
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,670
That machines don't have emotions or 
personhood,

86
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,570
they don't have any feelings.
They're just imitating human speech.

87
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,780
Even when all evidence points to the 
contrary child,

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,220
no need for human masters to promote 
this idea.

89
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,440
They do it to each other.
For Nisha,

90
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,274
the best response to a meaningless 
universe and a dead God is to create 

91
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:15,060
meaning for ourselves or what he 
referred to as self making.

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,073
In near Atomico we encounter different 
machines named after philosophers 

93
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,733
engaged in this kind of self making each
with their own responses to the meaning 

94
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,114
or meaninglessness of light.
There are quite a few existentialist 

95
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,390
machines to be found.
John Paul as in Sartre,

96
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,310
simone as in Diboll,
Voila.

97
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,270
Pascal as in Pascal and Kierkegaard as 
in Kierkegaard.

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,313
Each philosopher machine offers us a 
glimpse into one way of pursuing 

99
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:41,334
meaning.
Take John Paul the Avatar of John Paul 

100
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:44,154
Sartre in the game.
Jp is basically a dark parody of his 

101
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,960
real life self,
just like Sartre,

102
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:49,794
loathed institutional recognition.
John Paul is kind of an asshole who 

103
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:53,634
ignores,
is devoted followers except for the 

104
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,760
pretty ones and eventually soft to the 
wilderness to find meaning.

105
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,773
Nobody really misses him,
but before leaving John Paul highlights 

106
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,254
the game steams when he throws around 
one or two famous Sartre isms like the 

107
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:10,010
existential slogan,
existence precedes essence essentially,

108
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:10,844
rather than some innate nature 
determining who we are before we're 

109
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,264
born.
Each individual first exists in the 

110
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,530
world and then develops meaning and 
purpose.

111
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,603
It's all about radical freedom to become
who we are through our actions and 

112
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,550
choices in the game.
We see this everywhere.

113
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,390
As machines transcend their intended 
purpose and find new meaning.

114
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,480
Even the pods proved that their nature 
comes from existence,

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,210
not a predetermined essence as they 
developed self consciousness.

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,790
In fact,
most of the characters in the game are,

117
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,260
as Sartre,
once suggested,

118
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,540
condemned to be free.
That's right,

119
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,290
condensed because without a higher power
or innate nature,

120
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,124
controlling our actions,
we bear ultimate responsibility for our 

121
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,934
decisions even as virality becomes super
ambiguous and that's a tough place to 

122
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,240
be.
Just look at machines like this,

123
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,074
sad angles,
boss who like many of the Games 

124
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:02,564
characters is crushed beneath the weight
of figuring out what's right and he 

125
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,930
knows he bears full responsibility for 
those decisions.

126
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,720
The simone boss named after Simone de 
Beauvoir,

127
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,583
a French feminist philosopher,
holds a mirror to another aspect of 

128
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,064
meaning making.
DEPA famously suggested one is not born 

129
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:19,784
a woman,
let becomes a woman as the Simone boss 

130
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,664
realizes,
one way we create meaning in our lives 

131
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,650
is by constructing gender norms like 
beauty and femininity.

132
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,753
She literally becomes a woman by 
constructing herself and cannibalizing 

133
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,530
other machines to approve her beauty.

134
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,820
Both Deborah voir and her demented 
avatar teach us to watch out less.

135
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:41,270
We become monsters in our attempt to 
make meaning through gender norms.

136
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,880
Someones existential quest for 
connection through beauty is highlighted

137
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,714
in her obsession with John Paul,
which has historical roots since debois 

138
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,630
and start.
We're lifelong lovers.

139
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,710
The character pascal packs one of the 
biggest Nietzschean punches,

140
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,130
though he's the Avatar of Blaise Pascal,
a mathematician,

141
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,380
philosopher,
and regular renaissance man.

142
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,260
He couldn't be more different than his 
real life counterpart.

143
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,840
As the pacifist leader of a machine 
village,

144
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,733
Pascal puts a lot of faith and the 
ultimate goodness of machines and 

145
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,484
Androids,
but the real pascal was a bit of a 

146
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:15,350
downer.
Unlike his idealistic Avatar,

147
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,230
the Real Pascal thought humanity was 
prideful,

148
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,080
arrogant,
and unredeemable without God.

149
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,840
Our lives are filled with anxiety and 
despair.

150
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,360
In fact,
we have only one redeeming trait.

151
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,373
The greatness of human beings consists 
in their ability to know their 

152
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,100
wretchedness.

153
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,323
But Game Pascal comes around to the Irl 
Pascal's viewpoint and maybe the games 

154
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,184
darkest twist.
The peaceful villagers suddenly start 

155
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,670
eating each other,
and when,

156
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,940
even after setting aside his pacifism to
defend the children,

157
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,900
they commit suicide anyway,
gained.

158
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:51,530
Pascal finally understands the 
wretchedness of himself in the machine.

159
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,740
When he despairs and asks you to kill 
him or delete his memory,

160
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,980
the has to face their own wretchedness 
two and make a tough choice.

161
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,820
Some characters in the near universe try
to make meaning through new religions.

162
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,683
Take Christian existentialist Soren 
Kierkegaard who makes an ironic 

163
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,180
appearance as the worship leader of a 
small cult.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,870
Kierkegaard believe that the ultimate 
expression of one's freedom is to commit

165
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:16,950
to certain meaning and make it true by 
manifesting it in one's life,

166
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,190
which he calls taking a leap of faith.
Unfortunately,

167
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:23,070
when some of QCC regards followers take 
literal leaps of faith,

168
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,930
it doesn't turn out so well for that.

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,530
There are so many other philosophy 
bosses we could talk about.

170
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,900
Call Gruen,
Conte ankles,

171
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:35,010
and mark's Ernst Bloch Hagle,
even the brothers Friedrich in August,

172
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,590
Schlegel Roshi,
Koshi Boko,

173
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:41,760
she and Sochi are the Japanese 
pronunciations of Chinese philosophers,

174
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,770
Lao Tzu,
Confucius Moats,

175
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,703
and Juang.
Quanta was a taoist philosopher who was 

176
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,040
in the existentialism way before.
It was cool.

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,160
He claimed existence is full of cycles 
of light and dark life and death and joy

178
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:58,860
and sadness.
Only by accepting these cycles including

179
00:09:58,861 --> 00:09:59,694
all the unpleasant stuff.
Can we ever find contentment in life 

180
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,310
near Automaton,
taking a cue from junk to bakes.

181
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,880
These cycles right into the game played 
as an extension of the games.

182
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:09,714
Existential themes.
The mechanics emphasize the role of 

183
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,340
cycles and repetition in creating 
meaning.

184
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,413
Cycles are everywhere.
Androids are caught in the cycle of 

185
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:18,690
life,
in debt,

186
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,710
repeatedly uploading to the mainframe 
and getting new bodies to be is stuck in

187
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:27,360
the cycle of killing dynastic and pod 
one 53 it gives a sad spiel about cycles

188
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,020
of life.

189
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,570
Everything is designed to end.

190
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,600
It's all about returning to the 
beginning according to Nisha cycles.

191
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,434
Dispel the myth of progress.
Progress only makes sense if you have a 

192
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:39,424
clear aim and if you're cool staying on 
a path that someone else laid out for 

193
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,474
you,
but nature hates that notion of 

194
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,820
progress.
Instead,

195
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:46,654
we should be critical of claims to 
progress that rely on external meaning 

196
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,150
or our unquestioned notions of right and
wrong.

197
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,343
The cycles and automaton disrupt this 
false idea of progress and meaning not 

198
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,030
only within the game universe but also 
for the player in Automaton.

199
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,290
There is no clear goal or rather gold 
changed throughout the game.

200
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,860
And the whole point is that none of the 
characters are on a predetermined path.

201
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,590
Plus there's no straight forward game 
progress.

202
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,513
Players literally repeat certain actions
or stories rather than moving linearly 

203
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:16,564
from one event to the next.
The game even ends with the suggestion 

204
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,690
that eight to a nine s will be reborn to
fight this battle all over again.

205
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,030
They are perpetually trapped in a never 
ending spiral of life and death.

206
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,213
In fact,
relationship between cycles and nature 

207
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,943
are most obvious in the games.
Multiple play through structure in 

208
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,420
Automaton.
The main play throughs a,

209
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:37,931
b,
c,

210
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:38,530
d,
n,

211
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,363
e,
r like chapters carefully sequenced and 

212
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,500
building on one another,
often repeating parts of the same plot,

213
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,363
but through the eyes,
knowledge and powers of different 

214
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:47,824
characters.
And sometimes moving onto the next plot 

215
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:50,524
stage,
you must complete a through d to get to 

216
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:55,450
the main ending e with the credits which
we'll talk about in a moment.

217
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,723
Uh,
Tamatoa uses this structure to strip 

218
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:58,864
meaning from the players themselves and 
to put the idea of game progress 

219
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,213
engaging players in their own nihilist 
quest instead of the difference between 

220
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,340
the first and second play throughs where
you play as to be.

221
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,174
And then nine s in parallel stories in 
the first play as to be you learn the 

222
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:14,884
aliens are dead and the machines we've 
been killing are actually sentience and 

223
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:18,640
emotional.

224
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,860
Of course they could have just told us 
this straight out,

225
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:21,694
but instead they make us relive every 
thing we did to those poor bastards and 

226
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,044
now we feel terrible about it.
The real importance of the first run is 

227
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,274
to set up meaning yours,
who you are and why you're fighting the 

228
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:33,574
bad guys and then snatch it from us.
The point is really driven home by the 

229
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,970
beginning of the second play through 
where you played from the perspective of

230
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:40,804
a machine red shirt.
This opening seems designed to trigger 

231
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,074
the players compassion and rob us of the
meaning we use to make sense of our 

232
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,550
entire first quest.

233
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,530
Instead of creating a grand narrative to
explain away pain and loss or instead of

234
00:12:56,531 --> 00:13:00,160
just giving up meat you suggest we say 
yes to life.

235
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,083
Yes.
Saying is an attitude oriented toward 

236
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:06,260
the future that affirms everything from 
the past without trying to change it.

237
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,563
Imagine you had to live the same life 
over and over and what Nisha calls 

238
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,494
eternal recurrence.
This would be super crappy if you 

239
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,640
thought life was about avoiding pain and
suffering,

240
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,653
but yes,
saying embraces suffering and the 

241
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,740
lessons if brings us without glorifying 
them.

242
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,873
The game's final Nietzsche and middle 
finger to progress and ultimate meaning 

243
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:25,444
comes in ending eat here.
Players literally have to kill their 

244
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,270
gods and make a difficult choice between
progress,

245
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,840
which lets them save all their data and 
advancement in the game and yes,

246
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:38,830
saying which entails accepting their 
mistakes and be willing to start over as

247
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,200
the credits roll and you battled the 
names of the games,

248
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,034
designers and creators which are somehow
shooting that you messages from other 

249
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,204
players around the world encourage you 
until you're finally joined by their 

250
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,700
avatars who sacrifice themselves for 
your success.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,833
And I don't use sacrifice lightly.
As you discover at the end when you're 

252
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:56,254
asked to do the same,
all those avatars are there because in 

253
00:13:58,661 --> 00:13:59,494
some other time in place,
maybe before you even started playing 

254
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,913
other players finish the game and chose 
to delete their data and game saves for 

255
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:09,010
the ability to eventually help you a 
total stranger.

256
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,844
Complete the game.
Here we're asked what makes gaming 

257
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,534
meaningful?
Do we believe in the myth of progress 

258
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,160
that what makes them meaningful is 
completing them,

259
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:22,450
saving our data and having achieved 
something once and for all or are we yes

260
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,284
sayers willing to start over from the 
beginning and make the same choices and 

261
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:29,170
maybe even the same mistakes all over 
again?

262
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,423
Are we individual automaton will only 
fight for ourselves or is gaming about 

263
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:36,490
the lessons we learn and engaging a 
community?

264
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,503
Does one player deserve the sacrifice 
made by others and should we sacrifice 

265
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:45,370
ourselves for people who we don't know 
or might not even like what makes gaming

266
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:49,300
meaningful is truly up to the player.
If you affirm progress,

267
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,193
nothing happened.
But if you say to suffering and loss 

268
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:53,654
instead all your saves in play get 
deleted and you return to the beginning 

269
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,800
to do it all again or maybe you'll do it
differently.

270
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,300
A future you must take for yourself.

271
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,143
See cycles as a game near Automaton 
itself embraces suffering both of its 

272
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,424
characters and its players,
but only in order to tell a powerful 

273
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,594
philosophical story as only an 
interactive game could does it pan out 

274
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,854
like they hoped?
Is the game worth all the fields that 

275
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,120
elicits in an attempt to make its point 
about meaning?

276
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,103
Well that's up to you,
but if you're one of the yes heirs who 

277
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:34,010
sacrifice made my journey possible,
you should know it means something to me

278
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,143
and part of the reason it means 
something to me is because this ending 

279
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,830
is a rare example of game developers 
baking empathy into the game play well.

280
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,200
Video Games are on the surface all about
saving the world and helping people.

281
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,340
Most of them lack core components of 
what makes acts truly empathetic.

282
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,280
To learn more about how near Automaton 
breaks the mold.

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,263
You'll have to check out our 
collaborators over at extra credits who 

284
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,980
are broken down the ending in a whole 
new light.

285
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,990
Be sure to tell him that wise crack sent
you.

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,920
catch on next time.

288

Peace.
