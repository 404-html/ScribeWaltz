1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,123
Technologies,

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,053
the other field to you like to keep 
control and I was just in South Africa 

3
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:21,701
interestingly where there is an issue 
now between local South Africans,

4
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,334
especially black ones who come from 
typically a deck around where they 

5
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:29,414
didn't have a lot of education and 
blacks and Bob when refugees who have a 

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,433
very good education and so they would 
get a lot of the it jobs except that 

7
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,780
they can't get working papers.
So you know,

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,733
whoever's got control of the resources 
it's going to use whatever excuse they 

9
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,710
can to keep other people out and it's 
not,

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,130
it's not men going around specifically 
keeping the women out.

11
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:57,290
But the,
the culture of the old boys club,

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,940
all these traditional things plus a,
if you like,

13
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:04,610
learned aversion to technology in 
science,

14
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,180
especially among women and girls.
And so all these things.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,260
Interesting.
Good role model

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,020
and just time,
uh,

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,390
there's a problem now with.
It's not just women,

18
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:29,391
it's men as well,
not being interested in good,

19
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,380
solid scientific,
technical,

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,250
mathematical education,
which is key for all of this.
