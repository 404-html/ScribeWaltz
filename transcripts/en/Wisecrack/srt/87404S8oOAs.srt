1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,190
A wise crack jared irl,
again,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,353
for those pumping in for the first time,
this is still an experiment where we 

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,970
quickly respond to developments in TV 
and film as they happen,

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,630
not just rick and Morty,
so if you like them or have a request,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,643
let us know the indicators.
Three return of the world enter was a 

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,064
pretty awesome job at marvel.
Movies with the vindicator is acting as 

7
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,964
an obvious stand in for the avengers and
rick acting as a mouthpiece for people 

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:27,864
disillusioned with the rather formulaic 
state of popular cinema or the writers 

9
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,700
have their own press releases.
Morning,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,580
there are a bunch of drama queens and 
spend an hour talking at 20 minutes.

11
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,290
Jumping around.
We'll ship blows up there.

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,640
A phase.
We did one,

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,950
it was the big event at at summer,
let it die,

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,070
but instead of focusing on Rick's beef 
with our Disney overlords,

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,260
we're going to set our sights a little 
higher today.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,363
Superhero films have been clumsy,
grasping with the concepts of good 

17
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:50,874
knievel for what seems like an eternity,
and this episode of Rick and morty 

18
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,414
comments on this and some pretty clever 
and even profound ways working on this 

19
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,600
wise crack.
Quick take on vindicator three,

20
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:03,210
the return over the world,
and you guessed it,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,940
spoilers.
First,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,980
a recap or he gets to choose the next 
adventure with Rick,

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
so he decides to spend it with his 
heroes.

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,880
The indicators in good Sanchez,
he and fashion rick gets blackout drunk,

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,773
destroys the ominous world under with 
little effort and traps the indicators 

26
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,800
in a series of trials that ruins them.
The real art of indicators.

27
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:23,634
Three,
like another morty adventure we know is 

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,620
more these optimistic worldview 
crumbling around him.

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
In the case of me and destroy mortise 
wholesome view of fairytales erodes as 

30
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,160
the genre is subverted.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,863
In this episode,
mortise faith in the indicators are 

32
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,100
roads as the superhero genre is a 
burden,

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,840
but beneath all the vendors and 
superhero jokes.

34
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,230
So your origin is what you fell into a 
vat of redundancy.

35
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,590
This episode is also about the 
complexities of good and evil.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,710
I'd like some adventures where mortise 
view of the world is shattered.

37
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,600
Rick plays a unique role in making his 
worldview.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,160
You disintegrate here after killing 
world under while blackout drunk,

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
rick creates a saw inspired puzzle that 
is less a thought out plan to make 

40
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,794
people confront their demons,
all La Jigsaw and more a drunk and 

41
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,220
scheme to push people over a moral cliff
and it works.

42
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,120
Vance shows his true colors.
You're the learning disabled kid.

43
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,160
New Photo APP,
Dwayne.

44
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,420
Okay,
but this is triggering me.

45
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,340
I need space.
I need space from a million ants,

46
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,040
kills Alan rails over.
A woman and crocky bought.

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
Brings out the indicators.
Little secret.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,600
What happened on Dorian five?
Nothing.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,560
Nothing.
We exterminated up planted by the end.

50
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,110
Rick gets to Lord over morty about the 
sham.

51
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,910
That is heroism.
I appreciate it.

52
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,744
Marty.
I know you were sucking the Koolaid out 

53
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:44,484
of the indicators,
so the fact that I was right about that 

54
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,640
must be pretty hard to admit.
Yeah,

55
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,474
it is.
What's really clever about this episode 

56
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,760
is how they draw from some of the more 
unique villains and popular cinema.

57
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,470
Brick is,
is this a saw thing?

58
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,380
Are you seriously sodding the 
syndicators 40.

59
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,830
I'm a drunk,
not a hack.

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,753
Unlike most antagonistic jigsaw isn't 
about senseless murder or financial 

61
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,030
game.
He wants to change people's paradigms by

62
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,470
making them endorse suffering in some 
cases to make them appreciate life more.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,433
Similarly drunk.
Rick's trials aren't meant primarily to 

64
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,603
eradicate the indicators,
but rather to create a moral crisis for 

65
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,940
them approving to morty that they are 
not heroes.

66
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,960
Every one in the universe is a hero.
Mom,

67
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
which is why we don't need jackets and 
I'm pretty sure we don't need 

68
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,830
vindicator.
Now.

69
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,750
I thought this was pretty cool in 
itself,

70
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,220
but what I thought really elevated this 
episode was a less obvious inspiration.

71
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,290
The joker mortise trip in the carnival 
ride seems inspired by Alan Moore's,

72
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,124
the killing joke.
When Commissioner Gordon is tortured by 

73
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,614
the joker like Jigsaw,
the joker isn't only motivated by 

74
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,124
murder.
He's out to prove that with one 

75
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:51,271
sufficiently bad day or could become 
just as mad as him as another joker.

76
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,300
Inspired by the killing joke puts it.
See Madness,

77
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,780
as you know,
is like gravity.

78
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,270
All it takes is a little push and what 
is Rick's shenanigans in this episode,

79
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:08,160
but to push the vindicator to lose,
they're just,

80
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:13,161
as the joker infects the once idealistic
harvey with his nihilistic philosophy by

81
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,990
killing Rachel and turning corrupt cops 
against him.

82
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,940
So too does rick turn the benevolent 
indicators into violent backstabbers?

83
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,020
Thus appending morty simplistic 
understanding of good and evil.

84
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,800
Oh,
I dunno.

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,990
You managed to destroyed just about 
everything today.

86
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,220
The villains,
the heroes,

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,050
the lines between them.
My childhood.

88
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,520
Thank you.
Okay,

89
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:35,370
so rick doesn't really buy that.
Heroes are good,

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,630
but there's a larger point about how the
way were spoonfed narratives of good and

91
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,370
evil is actually super bad.
You know,

92
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,690
narratives like this one,
everyone in the universe is a hero.

93
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,720
All you have to do is know the 
difference between good and bad and root

94
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,554
for good,
but thinking in such simple terms can 

95
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,140
lead to problems.
For philosopher Jacques Ron Sierra,

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,980
the problem with evil,
with a big capital eat,

97
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,853
you know the kind in every single 
superhero movie is there any kind of 

98
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:05,280
conflict becomes the ultimate struggle 
of good and evil.

99
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,930
The value of winning that battle becomes
well,

100
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,820
infinite.

101
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,540
It's a fight for the soul of the world 
or galaxy or universe,

102
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,433
all or nothing,
so people can do even be worse in the 

103
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,260
world to achieve victory,
but as the logic goes,

104
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,213
isn't a justified what's so bad about 
letting a few thousand people die if it 

105
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,190
means destroying ultimate evil?
Well,

106
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,490
oh,
what happened on Dorian five?

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
Nothing.
Nothing.

108
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,990
We exterminated a planet.
Wait,

109
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,040
huh?
Do Nama?

110
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,680
Tron was hiding there.
He's a shape shifter.

111
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,560
Destroying Dorian five was the only way 
to kill him.

112
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,620
I could have made you a device to 
detect.

113
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,493
Do Nama metronic from orbit like that.
What does this say about the 

114
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,133
syndicators?
To summarize the problem with infinite 

115
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,513
evil,
whether in the form of world destroyers 

116
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,560
or mortal humans is they weren't 
infinite justice.

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,513
The kind that doesn't really care about 
morals or people of Dorian five and 

118
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:02,580
often even loses sight of the justice 
part by the end of the episode,

119
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:03,414
Supernova has also been infected with 
Rick's nihilistic philosophy no longer 

120
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,440
believing in a real division between 
good and evil.

121
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,543
However,
she recognizes the simplistic division 

122
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,870
must be upheld.
It's like you said,

123
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,660
there's no right or wrong.
I never said that.

124
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,610
The galaxies faith in the vindicator 
that keeps the galaxy secure.

125
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,260
She's willing to kill Rick and Morty and
even her lover to protect the perception

126
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,680
that the indicators are good.
It's not their actions that matter.

127
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,900
It's the galaxies faith in their 
actions.

128
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,340
That does.
I'm pretty sure.

129
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,350
This is another shout out to the dark 
knight,

130
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,363
which is probably the best example of 
moral grayness in a comic book movie 

131
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,203
where Batman lies about the goodness of 
Harvey Dent to maintain peace in order 

132
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,150
in Gotham,
supernova wants the galaxy to believe in

133
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,730
a similar lie about herself.
In both cases,

134
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,564
people are advocating for a noble lie.
The idea that societies can be built on 

135
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,914
a myth that maintains order.
An idea made famous by the Greek 

136
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,424
philosopher Plato and it's not the first
time rick and morty has made this kind 

137
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:03,250
of dark.
Knight asked Noble Lie,

138
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,910
shout out.
We found it inside a lockbox box.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Inside King Jellybeans closet.
We have to tell the people,

140
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,630
wait,
destroy it,

141
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,870
or people will get more from the idea.
He represented from the Jelly Bean,

142
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,190
he actually was.
Now,

143
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:27,024
this is kind of philosophy 101,
but it's worth noting at least because 

144
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:30,444
of its relation to the dark knight,
but where the dark knight kind of 

145
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,144
celebrates the slide.
Rick and morty uses it to deconstruct 

146
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:36,774
the myths of superheroes.
Rick says good and bad are artificial 

147
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,260
constructs.
Yeah,

148
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,094
well,
I get the feeling he kind of needs that 

149
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,610
to be the case.
However,

150
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:48,240
rather than just deconstructing good and
evil as arbitrary concepts,

151
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,150
which by the way it's done before.
I mean seriously,

152
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,090
I may be the devil,
but your grandpa is the devil.

153
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,020
Show was also suggesting that the 
complete absence of these concepts isn't

154
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:58,854
so great either.
This is a clever call back to the last 

155
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:03,780
episode where Dr Wong Confronts Rick in 
saying,

156
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,703
only connection between your 
unquestionable intelligence and the 

157
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:10,170
sickness destroying your family is that 
everyone in your family,

158
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:13,620
you've included use intelligence to 
justify sickness.

159
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,190
Whereas the vindicator fail to 
critically engaged with their methods or

160
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:18,024
even their mission.
Rick refuses to engage with his 

161
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:23,730
decisions for the exact opposite reason 
because nothing matters,

162
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,120
and if nothing matters and good and evil
or just social constructs,

163
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,013
then he can't consider his actions evil.
You can just continue doing whatever he 

164
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:32,364
wants,
so the episode presents us with to 

165
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,570
differing perspectives regarding good 
knievel,

166
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,780
both of which are in typical rick and 
morty fashion,

167
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,763
completely dismal.
We either have zero conviction of the 

168
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:44,514
division between good and evil,
which leads rick to doing whatever he 

169
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:51,390
wants and it not mattering,
or we have complete and utter conviction

170
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,500
of what constitutes good and evil and 
people end up doing really messed up for

171
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,230
the sake of good,
like blow up an entire planet.

172
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,210
As always,
in Rick and Morty,

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,510
there are no right answers,
only wrong ones.

174
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,180
