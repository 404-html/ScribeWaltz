1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,530
Norm minetta and I'm vice chairman of 
the hill and Knowlton

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,923
infrastructure is so important is it's 
directly linked to productivity 

3
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:25,144
increases.
And there's been a tremendous amount of 

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,800
productivity increase since the end of 
World War II.

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,500
And that increased,
stopped,

6
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:40,501
maybe not stop,
but it slowed down about maybe 10,

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,580
12 years ago.
The there was still increasing,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but the rate of the increase of 
flattened out.

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,300
But in the last,
I think five years or so,

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,163
85 to eight years,
productivity has gone down because of 

11
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,224
congestion in urban areas.
And so my feeling is that here we are 

12
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:09,781
competing in a global economic place and
we cannot allow,

13
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,613
and we can't afford to have our 
productivity going down at a time when 

14
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:20,410
we're competing in the economic a world 
marketplace.

15
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,890
And so that's why we need this kind of 
infusion of money into infrastructure.

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,530
Well,
the logical source in the past has been,

17
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,383
uh,
the gasoline tax or the fuel tax for a 

18
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,980
diesel fuel or excise tax on batteries 
and tires,

19
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,893
etc.
Now with the fuel efficiency of 

20
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:52,680
automobiles going up,
uh,

21
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,480
the 18.4
cents,

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,690
federal gasoline tax just produces less 
money into the highway trust fund.

23
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,490
So it's either going to be increased 
gasoline taxes,

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,400
which for which there's a resistance or,
uh,

25
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,690
some other form of fuel tax,
maybe based on the odometer reading,

26
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,510
uh,
and uh,

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,793
but there's still going to be a gap from
what that generates and what the needs 

28
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:31,044
are.
And my feeling is that public private 

29
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:38,931
partnerships,
how to be used to fill that gap.

30
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,230
I think when you think about,
uh,

31
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,300
infrastructure,
uh,

32
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:52,301
it probably would a surround a what I 
would think of maybe as employment.

33
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,280
What does it do in terms,
especially right now,

34
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,210
uh,
given the unemployment rate,

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,673
what is it do in terms of employment?
What does it do in terms of the 

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,720
environment and what does it do in terms
of the economy as a whole?

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,640
And,
um,

38
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,210
and I think from there you can take 
subsets of each of those broad areas and

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,453
come up with criteria that would be 
applicable to any project that might be 

40
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,214
funded so that you're looking for 
efficiency and effectiveness of that 

41
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,830
funding.
So then at the end of the day,

42
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,800
it's not just this question of,
Oh,

43
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,000
that's nice you spent $200 million on 
that project,

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,500
but what did we get for that $200 
million?

45
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,310
Seems to me that

46
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,180
there's been a lot of talk about a 
return to more bipartisanship,

47
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,463
that the American people are tired of 
the kind of constant bickering going on 

48
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:13,890
back and forth between the Congress and 
the executive branch,

49
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,540
and that,
uh,

50
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,220
there ought to be more,
um,

51
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,270
civility,
I guess,

52
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,930
in the relationship,
uh,

53
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,610
between the administration and the 
Congress panned,

54
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,150
uh,
within the congress as well.

55
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,843
Yeah.
