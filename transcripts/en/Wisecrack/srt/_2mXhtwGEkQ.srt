1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,630
Talking to the general public around the
country is that most people don't have a

2
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,284
very high level of scientific literacy.
People seem to be afraid of science and 

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,270
certainly people seem to be afraid of 
mathematics.

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,523
And I think that's such a shame because 
I don't think it's as hard as people 

5
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,100
seem to think it is.
Um,

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,470
you know,
people have this idea that if you're not

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,370
brilliant like Einstein,
you can't be a scientist.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,360
And that's just a myth.
I mean,

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,400
he was the one out of a million 
scientists,

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,413
but there were 999,999
other scientists who are not as 

11
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:53,000
brilliant but to just do great science 
as well.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,283
And so a lot of the work that I do is to
try to dispel these myths about science 

13
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:02,930
being on Arcane Hartfield and math being
in comprehensible.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,100
I just said,
you know what,

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,700
we need to know math to be a good 
scientist,

16
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:08,534
but math is a language and we need to 
learn the language because that's the 

17
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:14,090
language of science.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,070
And you know,
if I go to Sweden or Ethiopia,

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,093
I can't speak that language.
And that doesn't mean I can't live in 

20
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,790
that country and function.
I need to learn the language.

21
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,290
It's the same with science and math.
You need to learn the language first and

22
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,910
then you can work in those fields.
But it's not mysterious and arcane.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,350
It's a way of looking at the world in a 
way of exploring the world and trying to

24
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:41,560
make sense of the world.
So I,

25
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,394
I really,
uh,

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,393
I,
it disappoints me that people are so 

27
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,730
frightened of science and frightened the
math.

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,983
I think the only way we'll have a sea 
change and people's appreciation of 

29
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:51,950
science,
technology,

30
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:56,060
engineering,
math is through a broad effort,

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,980
partially part of the government.
Partially the work of scientists like me

32
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:01,814
who communicate to the public,
partially the parents of young kids not 

33
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:10,130
propagating myths about science is hard.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,491
And,
Oh,

35
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,020
I never did well in math.
You know,

36
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:13,310
you don't need to do that.
Yeah.

37
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:15,710
It's got to be a joint effort on 
everybody's part.

38
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,850
People need to realize that the world is
changing.

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,930
It's a very different world than it was 
2030 years ago.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,320
And we have to be aware of that as a 
culture,

41
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:32,321
as a society,
and recognize that the rest of the world

42
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,490
is moving on and moving on pretty 
quickly.

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,683
And if we want to maintain the level of 
comfort in our culture and society that 

44
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:41,384
we've become accustomed to,
we have to really get in there and we 

45
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:44,804
have to educate our kids and bring them 
up to speed with commensurate with 

46
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:52,150
what's going on in the other countries.
And I worry that that's not right.
