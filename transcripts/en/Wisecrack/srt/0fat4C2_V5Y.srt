1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,190
Yeah,
so I was reviewing a book by a guy named

2
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,700
Mark Mcdonald who teaches at Ucla and 
um,

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,770
which I think is a terrific book called 
the program era.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,600
And the argument of the book is that 
American fiction since 1945,

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,483
1950,
has been highly influenced by the fact 

6
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,524
that so many novelists and so many 
people who teach novelists have gone 

7
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,020
through writing programs,
um,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,070
and it's not a take down in any way.
His book,

9
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:36,904
his book basically says that writing 
programs provide a certain environment 

10
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:40,954
where a particular kind of fiction gets 
produced and these kinds of fiction are 

11
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:46,030
very interesting.
They're often very experimental.

12
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:48,730
They take fiction of directions that 
otherwise it wouldn't go.

13
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,760
It doesn't mean that everything's being 
dumbed down or cookie cuttered.

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,023
Um,
and I thought that was very provocative 

15
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:54,844
and he gave some pretty good readings of
contemporary fiction to back up his 

16
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:00,394
claim about it.

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,810
So I would tend to agree with him.
I mean,

18
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,330
it's,
it is different.

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,390
It's a fact of life since 1950 or so,
that wasn't true before that,

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,370
um,
writers had different ways of organizing

21
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,204
themselves and different sort of social 
groupings in which to perform their 

22
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:17,614
work.
But the fact that many of them go 

23
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:19,654
through the university now,
it does effect what they write but 

24
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,670
doesn't mean they write it.
What they're writing is an interesting.

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,250
I've,
as I said in that piece,

26
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,084
I myself was a creative writing major in
college and I look back on those 

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,760
experiences with great fondness and I 
think they were very good for me too.

28
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:40,390
So I think it's a totally appropriate 
thing to have inside the academy.

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,830
I wish I could say it made it better,
but um,

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,310
it certainly gave me lots of models to 
bounce off of and learn from.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,860
And then part of it is just that I wrote
poetry and you know,

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,110
not that many people are into 
contemporary poetry,

33
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,990
but if you can hang out with the people 
who are in your college,

34
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,960
it's really a wonderful thing to share.
Um,

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,833
and I really valued that a lot,
so I'm glad I had the opportunity to do 

36
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:07,704
it.
And I think it's good thing to good 

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,350
opportunity for students to have.
