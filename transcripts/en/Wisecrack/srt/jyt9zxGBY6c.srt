00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,280
Hey everyone,
jared,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,173
I possibly rl here and today we're 
questioning the nature of our reality 

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,703
season two of westworld premiere this 
week and it got some pretty mixed 

4
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,244
reactions,
but hopefully it's just setting the 

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,314
stage for great stuff to come.
Today I want to talk about the biggest 

6
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:18,704
question the premiere raises.
Is there any difference between humans 

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,663
and flesh box?
And the biggest clue I'm going to argue 

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,633
is right here in the intro.
Welcome this wisecrack quick take on 

9
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,170
season two,
episode one of Westworld and spoilage.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,783
First a quick recap.
In the aftermath of Ford's ranger over 

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,710
retirement party,
Bernard Poles and inception and wakes up

12
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:41,840
disoriented on a beach.
Bernard joins.

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,674
Dalio is head of operations Karl Strand 
as they hunt down the rest of the 

14
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,540
malfunctioning hosts.
But in the meantime,

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,230
we see flashbacks of Bernard weeks 
earlier trying to survive the parties.

16
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,064
Immediate aftermath.
Hail Brings Bernard two or secret lab 

17
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:54,884
where they Zuckerberg everything by 
secretly harvesting the guest personal 

18
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,334
information and DNA stubs stranded.
Bernard find that all the hosts are 

19
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:05,900
floating in a body of water that 
shouldn't exist and Bernard reveals that

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,670
he killed them.
Count.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,933
Meanwhile,
Mavis still trying to find her daughter 

22
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,640
and as enlisted the help of this use of 
the city.

23
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,474
Yet delores and teddy are on a straight 
up murder spree and Dolores has a new 

24
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:23,980
hobby recycling lines from season one in
rapid succession.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,830
He's five ft lights just like anything 
to me

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,173
later.
She suggests they take the fun to the 

27
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,034
humans on the mainland and William is 
having a grand old time trying not to 

28
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,740
die before we're getting introduced to 
the mazes.

29
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:39,900
Much anticipated sequel,
the door

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,650
have to make it back out the door.

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,230
What does it mean?
Well,

32
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,390
we're going to have to keep watching to 
find out now.

33
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,224
There seems to be too important phrases 
that we should keep in mind as the 

34
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:57,331
season progresses.
The first is free and the second is what

35
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:58,864
is real,

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,850
which is irreplaceable.

37
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,450
Let's start with the first,
since season one,

38
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:10,440
westworld has teased the idea that we're
not all that different from the host

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,573
humans fancy that there's something 
special about the way we perceive the 

40
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:19,521
world and yet we live in newbs as tight 
and as close to as the host.

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,143
Seldom questioning choices contend for 
the most part to be told what to do 

42
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,320
next.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,470
Hosts are guided by their programming.
That's pretty obvious,

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,543
but this episode goes to great lengths 
to invert our understanding of the 

45
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,070
nature of that program.
Previously,

46
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,860
we learned that the host had specific 
drives.

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,783
What are your,

48
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,330
I tend to my herd,
look after my wife

49
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,520
and now dolores is asking the park's 
guess what their drives are.

50
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,860
What are your drives please?
I don't want to die.

51
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,980
The basic survival instinct is likened 
to the cornerstone

52
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,050
survival.
Sure.

53
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,053
Cornerstone

54
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,963
or the foundational memories that define
hosts like mave or Bernard backstories 

55
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,720
do more than amuse guests.
They anchor the host.

56
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,850
It's their cornerstone just as the 
hosts,

57
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:13,684
our program with certain instincts,
so too are the humans evolutionarily 

58
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,500
program to pursue survival above all 
else.

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,993
This idea that humans are primarily 
guided by their survival instinct is 

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
really driven home by this 
juxtaposition.

61
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,090
Charlotte Hale tells Bernard hosts only 
do what they're programmed to do.

62
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,283
They do with their program,
and immediately a delose board member 

63
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,330
runs for what he thinks will save his 
life.

64
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,870
Some lab techs with the vehicle.
Of course it was a trap.

65
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,823
The host took advantage of the guest 
basic survival instincts or to put 

66
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,140
another way they're programming.
Okay,

67
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,810
so humans don't like to die.
That's not exactly,

68
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,644
I'm just a machine one on one,
but it's with mave that things get 

69
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,310
really interesting.

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,360
Maybe it's one of the few hosts who has 
actually seen her programming.

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,720
Not only that,
she knows someone manipulated her code,

72
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,390
so she would escape the park and recruit
her fellow hosts,

73
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,373
but she nonetheless tries to navigate 
what free will means when it seems all 

74
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,530
of her choices are predestined at the 
end of season one.

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,393
There's a kind of paradox in that she 
must choose between two things she was 

76
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,654
programmed to do while on the train.
She can escape the park as this 

77
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,584
mysterious code change wants or to or go
back to her fake daughter if it was 

78
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:24,994
ambiguous before mave stance on what is 
real is made abundantly clear when 

79
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,420
sizemore tells her that her daughter 
isn't really hers,

80
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
it's just a story.
Somebody we programmed,

81
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,810
she's not real.
But instead of rejecting this fiction,

82
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
she says,
all right,

83
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,830
what about me?
My dreams,

84
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,930
my thoughts,
my body?

85
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,540
And they don't know.
What if I took these fingers?

86
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,690
Don't use them to decorate the walls 
with your outsize personality.

87
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:07,060
Would that

88
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,893
be real?
Rather than getting tripped up about 

89
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:12,340
what is really real may for search her 
own reality.

90
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,440
So what does it mean to embrace 
something,

91
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,303
even though it's a fiction?
Westworld here asserts a radical 

92
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,514
skepticism toward what is really real,
especially as far as humanity is 

93
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,864
concerned.
The fact that Mavis searching for her 

94
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,174
daughter is no accident.
The show is overtly using maternal 

95
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:33,160
instincts to argue that humans are no 
less dictated by code then hosts.

96
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,030
It's why they threw a baby with its 
mother into the new intro for humans.

97
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:41,020
Maternal care is strongly associated 
with a kind of biological coding.

98
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,943
You and mother's care for their young 
and let them live a parasitic existence 

99
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:48,370
for the next 1825 years of their life 
because their genes tell them to.

100
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,950
And while we see similar behavior in 
chimps,

101
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,880
the same can't be said for other animals
who exhibit different biologically coded

102
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,160
ways to relate to their young bears 
abandoned.

103
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,310
They're young.
If they're too weak,

104
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,443
harp seals ditch them after 12 days to 
find another mate cuckoos trick other 

105
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,650
animals into doing their dirty work and 
some spiders just go ahead and let their

106
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,484
babies eat them alive.
It's called [inaudible] and it's so in 

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,993
math,
but the point is can we really call 

108
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,350
naves relationship to her daughter fake 
when we as humans are reared by an adult

109
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,184
woman because her genes tell her to 
coddle us instead of dumbass onto the 

110
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,700
neighbor's lawn and that's the real 
meaning of the boy Ford's words.

111
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,863
Everything in here is code William,
the host and it's human guests are 

112
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:34,760
bounded by their programming,
whether it be genetic or artificial into

113
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,970
further muddy the waters of this real 
versus fake distinction.

114
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,893
Let's turn back to burn Arnold's words 
that what is real is what is 

115
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,420
irreplaceable.
If that's true,

116
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,254
then Arnold's not real because he was 
replaced by Bernard and there's a whole 

117
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,870
room full of Bernard's we've seen in 
this trailer.

118
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,270
And if Arnold can get replaced by a 
host,

119
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,840
can we all,
there's one more phrase,

120
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:56,230
all motors

121
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,063
function.

122
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,570
Now there's one more thing on my mind.
When Bernard taps into the Mesh Network,

123
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:04,404
he troubleshoots his own malfunction and
we get a list of everything wrong with 

124
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,760
him.
Lapse in time.

125
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,623
And this big word prosopagnosia turns 
out this means face blindness and could 

126
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:18,180
potentially explain why the hell burn 
artists fixated on this corpse.

127
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,223
But to hear more about that,
along with a deep dive into what is 

128
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,104
real,
