This video is brought to you by

00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,100
Hey,
wisecrack.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,170
Jerod here.
Today we're talking about the movie that

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:11,560
made Batman v Superman look like an art 
house masterpiece.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,573
Justice League.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,000
God,
I wish it was that one.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,990
Okay.
Technically superfriends,

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,100
but still better than justice league.
Yeah,

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,500
that's the one.
So full disclosure,

10
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:28,030
justice league is not good.
It's trite Aif I believe in truth,

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,980
but I'm also a big fan of justice and 
yeah,

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,450
if that line didn't tip you off,
they also totally botched superman.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,453
Worst of all,
the film neutered all the thematic 

14
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:37,834
ambitions of its predecessor throwing 
these superman as Christ metaphor into 

15
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,870
the trash,
but beneath all these flaws,

16
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:44,704
there's one central issue that makes 
Justice League so forgettable after 

17
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,870
subjecting ourselves to all 121 minutes 
of this film over and over again.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,790
Seriously,
I think I've seen it like five times.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,230
We think the film's main failure comes 
from its inability to juggle two things,

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,333
advancing the main conflict with 
steppenwolf and introducing us to our 

21
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,890
new Palette of characters while in a 
better film.

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,730
These two aspects would work in concert 
with each other in justice league.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,653
It's the complete opposite.
Every time we have backstory or 

24
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:14,734
character development,
it seems to come at the expense of the 

25
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:20,050
main story to understand how this is 
even possible,

26
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:23,800
though we first need to understand one 
fundamental lesson in screenwriting,

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,640
dramatic action,
motionless,

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,550
wisecrack condition on the Justice 
League.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,140
What went wrong,
and yeah,

30
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:32,290
if you can spoil a Turd,
spoilers for justice league ahead.

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,750
Also Batman v Superman and infinity 
ward.

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,733
But first a quick recap.
Justice League takes place in a world 

33
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,484
without superman.
After the man of steel was killed by 

34
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,620
Doomsday Bruce.
Wayne is racked by guilt.

35
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,663
Well supposedly,
but bruce doesn't have much time to 

36
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:52,540
dwell on this because a new world ending
threat is knocking on earth store in the

37
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,040
form

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,020
of the end of worlds can only to

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,740
wants to turn earth into a hellscape,
but to do so,

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,723
he'll need to reclaim the mother boxes.
Essentially dcs version of the Infinity 

41
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,643
Stones,
which were reactivated by Superman's 

42
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:10,414
death.
These boxes have been guarded by the 

43
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:15,130
ancient tribes of Amazon's Atlanteans 
and men for centuries,

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,173
but now that steppenwolf is back,
that man has to rally the old alliance 

45
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,014
and build a crack team to stop it.
You got familiar favorites like Bruce 

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,913
Wayne and Diana Prince,
along with a sheldon cooper inspired 

47
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,930
flash,
a Dothraki Aquaman,

48
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,260
and a CGI Cyborg.
So what is dramatic action?

49
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,110
While the term applies to all dramatic 
writing,

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,960
playwright David Edgar summed it up best
in his book.

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,790
How plays work by defining it as a 
project followed by a contradiction.

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,550
Now I know that sounds like a Russian 
nesting doll of terms,

53
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:46,384
so let's break it down by a project.
Edgar means more or less a goal usually 

54
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,170
stated with a subject,
verb and object.

55
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,153
So for example,
when Batman tries to bribe in Icelandic 

56
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:59,490
village into helping him find aqua man,
I'll give you 20,000

57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,333
to talk to this man right now.
We get state the project as that man 

58
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,810
looks for Aquaman.
Subject,

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,880
verb object.
Pretty simple,

60
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,743
right?
But Batman and Aquaman can't be besties 

61
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,590
right off the bat.
Otherwise,

62
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,580
there'd be no conflict in that rotten 
tomatoes score would slide even further.

63
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,640
That's where Edgar's idea of the 
contradiction comes in.

64
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,000
Typically our heroes don't get what they
want in a scene.

65
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,960
They run into the contradiction or more 
simply obstacles.

66
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,400
As it turns out,
for Bruce,

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,950
aqua man doesn't want to play nice with 
friends.

68
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,360
By comes,
we'll need you.

69
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,670
Don't count on a bad man.
Why not?

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,000
Because I want to keep coming here 
digging into my business,

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,853
getting into my life to Ed Group.
The best way to express the 

72
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:39,754
contradiction is a basic statement,
so if we were to put the project and 

73
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,930
contradiction together for this scene,
we get something like this.

74
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,350
Batman looks for Aquaman,
but Aquaman is a dick.

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,170
Now,
the reason why dramatic action is such a

76
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,004
big deal is that in advance is conflict.
Characters make certain choices in the 

77
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,380
pursuit of their goals only for new 
obstacles to pop up in response to these

78
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:05,170
choices.
Because the contradiction always gets in

79
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,900
the way of the project,
no scene should end.

80
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:08,734
On the same note,
it began just look at Batman who after 

81
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,290
being scorned by aqua man wonders if he 
lost him forever.

82
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,303
So you're saying you have no way of 
reconnecting with this tracking device 

83
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:21,084
in his he left without it.
This is what screenwriting Guru Robert 

84
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,023
Mckee means when he says that a scene 
must turn in his book story Mckee 

85
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,423
Rights.
If the value charged condition of the 

86
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:35,620
character's life stays unchanged from 
one end of a scene to the other,

87
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,783
nothing meaningful happens.
The scene has activity talking about 

88
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,200
this,
doing that,

89
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,180
but nothing changes in value.

90
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,223
It is a non event.
It's that last point that's relevant 

91
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,600
without dramatic action conflict in 
advance and the scene won't turn.

92
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,840
And this is where justice league 
seriously screws up.

93
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,063
While most of the scenes do have 
dramatic action and do turn they do so 

94
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,104
by focusing on our heroes,
individual arcs at the expense of the 

95
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,830
conflict.
And even though scenes turn it's done in

96
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:12,850
a way that's hasty and ungratifying.
Let's look at aquaman again.

97
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,550
Following the mother box being stolen 
from Atlantis,

98
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,140
we see him,
shrug it off.

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,153
The project of this scene would be,
aquaman wants to abandon Atlantis and 

100
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,460
that makes sense based on the character 
we saw earlier,

101
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,370
a man who's only allegiance is to 
himself,

102
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,870
strong man,
a strong as alone.

103
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,203
You ever heard that saying,
that's the opposite of what they're 

104
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:34,204
saying,
but then comes the contradiction and 

105
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,130
tell me if you see a problem here.
Your mother left you to save your life.

106
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,380
Karen,
imagine how much it costs,

107
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,713
but you're not a defenseless child.
Now it would have been her 

108
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,790
responsibility to follow that monster to
the surface and stop him.

109
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,160
No,
it's

110
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,210
yours.
Yeah,

111
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,044
so that character,
we have no idea who she is and that 

112
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,340
backstory yet never hinted at.
So while sure there is a contradiction,

113
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,584
we could express it as,
but some brando convinces aquaman to 

114
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,630
stay.
It feels cheap,

115
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,810
like a purely artificial inconvenient 
plot device,

116
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,020
almost as cheap as another poor dce.
You turn eight Dsx Martha,

117
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,410
if you will.
As it turns out,

118
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:31,130
this isn't the only time justice league 
seems to cheat when it comes to dramatic

119
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:34,550
action in our character scenes.
He's got to prove our point.

120
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,130
Let's look at one of the most 
frustrating moments in the movie,

121
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,920
the discussion to bring superman back to
life.

122
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,890
While we could talk about how the 
project of this scene,

123
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,390
bruce argues to bring back superman 
defies the logic of its predecessor.

124
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,373
He has the power to wipe out the entire 
human race and if we believe there's 

125
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,730
even a one percent chance that he is our
enemy,

126
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,583
we have to take it as an absolute 
certainty by concocting some weird pet 

127
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,530
cemetery debate.

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,020
We mean bring them back in like a Yay.
He's back way,

129
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:04,220
not in like a like a pet cemetery 
scenario.

130
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,150
It's actually the contradiction that 
really gets us while bruce advocates for

131
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,984
Superman's revival,
he encounters his first obstacle in the 

132
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:12,224
form of Diana,
who's worried about what happens if the 

133
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,490
plan fails.
You're risking lives.

134
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,620
There's and maybe comes this more.
We don't have time for a control group.

135
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,820
Is it a risk?
Yes,

136
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,040
but it's necessarily because of your 
guilt.

137
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,080
Now,
if this had you scratching your head,

138
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:31,970
you're not alone because nowhere in the 
proceeding our did the film show a Bruce

139
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,010
Wayne tormented by guilt,
no flashbacks,

140
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,380
no dreams,
no coping mechanisms,

141
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,180
and if you think we're being unduly 
harsh,

142
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:42,290
then know that all of these were 
employed in Batman v Superman to explain

143
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,660
bruises,
extreme distrust for the man of steel.

144
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,190
Just like with Aquaman,
the scene has dramatic action and yes it

145
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,024
turns,
but only through artificially inserted 

146
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,990
conflict.
Unsurprisingly,

147
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:54,824
there are some pretty big consequences 
for making so much of the dramatic 

148
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:00,830
action focus on our heroes,
very thin,

149
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,470
personal and interpersonal arcs.
In fact,

150
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:04,304
the film is so preoccupied with rushing 
to set up our characters and their own 

151
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:10,340
foibles like flashes,
social awkwardness,

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,170
aquaman's,
lone cop persona,

153
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,640
sideboard,
self hatred,

154
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,474
and Diana's isolation from the world 
that it's seemingly forget steppenwolf 

155
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,550
altogether.
Case in point.

156
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,210
Consider the mother boxes.
You know these

157
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,173
carried from planet to planet.
The mother boxes combined to form the 

158
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:31,721
unity and apocalyptic power that not 
only destroys world transforms them into

159
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,980
the primordial hellscape of steppenwolf 
spirit world.

160
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,893
Well,
it might surprise you to learn that 

161
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:39,544
Batman,
arguably the protagonist of the film 

162
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,380
only learns that the box is important at
the 30 minute mark,

163
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,543
but surely the rest of the film and our 
heroes are focused on keeping the boxes 

164
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,030
from steppenwolf's poorly CGI hands,
right?

165
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,170
Yeah.
No,

166
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,330
the first box is stolen from amazons 
without any of our heroes present.

167
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,250
The second one features a measly 32nd 
fight scene with Aquaman and just to rub

168
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,460
it in how little our heroes care about 
the actual plot.

169
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,413
The third and final mother box is 
basically stolen off screen while our 

170
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,320
team is recovering from a superman beat 
down another box.

171
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,850
He has the last one.
Now I know what you guys are thinking,

172
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,800
jared,
by assembling the team,

173
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,190
the Justice League is stopping 
Steppenwolf and while there's definitely

174
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,024
some merit to that idea,
this shouldn't be an either or scenario 

175
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
to prove my point.

176
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,170
Let's look at another film with a very 
similar premise.

177
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,093
Infinity war in the film fan is hellbent
on destroying half of all life by 

178
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,770
gathering the infinity stones after 
Bruce Banner Escape Stenosis,

179
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,440
grasping the opening scene,
the whole enlist the help of Dr.

180
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,100
Strange and Tony Stark.
If he gets his hands on all $6,

181
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,963
Dani,
you can destroy life on a scale hither 

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,570
to on dreamtime.
Importantly,

183
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,210
you'll notice three things in the scene.
One,

184
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,073
our heroes get together and learn of the
initial threat in under 15 minutes to 

185
00:09:58,801 --> 00:09:59,634
our heroes,
specifically strange envision possess 

186
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,353
infinity stones that puts them on a 
crash course with the plot and most 

187
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:07,974
importantly three our heroes.
Personal problems are intermixed with 

188
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:16,290
the conversation to stop Banjos who just
shaved your match glass me seriously.

189
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,940
Don't know how you fit your head into 
that,

190
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,130
how admit it.
You should've ducked out when I told you

191
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,860
to if it wasn't already obvious.

192
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,810
Stark and strange aren't exactly fond of
each other,

193
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:25,644
and the dramatic action of any given 
scene is as much about stopping fan ost 

194
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,740
as it is about learning to work 
together,

195
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,380
but as the to continue to fight 
alongside each other.

196
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,280
Their dysfunction goes from Tony,
reluctantly rescuing strange.

197
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,840
I got to tell you,
he's not really my friend.

198
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,243
Saving his life is more of a 
professional courtesy to strange 

199
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:46,980
bartering,
the time stone away to save Tony's life,

200
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,850
spare his life,
and I will give you the stone.

201
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,893
In this last instance,
the dramatic action of the scene is 

202
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,474
equally about plot stopping banjos and 
character Tony and strangers 

203
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,334
relationship.
The project is and wants to kill Tony 

204
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,843
and the contradiction is but strange 
stops him by giving away the time stone 

205
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,300
and to be honest,
this moment resonated.

206
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,930
Now we'd be wrong to say that this kind 
of interplay between our heroes,

207
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,160
personal conflict and the actual plot is
absent in justice league,

208
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,240
but we'd also be wrong to say that it's 
similar in terms of quality or scale.

209
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,283
Let's look at the flash for example.
While the film makes a point of showing 

210
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,080
his desperate need for friends,
I need friends.

211
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,950
This conflict doesn't really manifest 
itself anywhere else in the film,

212
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,770
let alone in a confrontation with 
steppenwolf.

213
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,120
The closest we have to it is this.
It's really cool.

214
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,890
You guys see ready to do battle and 
stuff,

215
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:42,650
but in full transparency,
I've never done battle.

216
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,583
Yes,
the dramatic action to the sequence 

217
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,474
could be stated as clashes,
scared to enter the frig and 

218
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:50,010
Steppenwolf,
but Batman convinces him,

219
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,933
but we have to ask at what part of the 
movie did indicate to us that he had 

220
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:56,710
combat stagefright.
Ultimately,

221
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:57,544
this scene feels like a tenuous tie in 
between Barry's personal struggles and 

222
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:04,570
stopping the world ending threat and the
film treats it as such.

223
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
After the flash rescue,
the hostages,

224
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,570
the film conveniently forgets any of his
stage fright.

225
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,130
Gross.
As a result,

226
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,820
these scenes often fail to evoke the 
hallmark of good writing,

227
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,743
aristotle's idea of catharsis or the 
purification or projection of emotions 

228
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,180
primarily through art.
Because Justice League fails to properly

229
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:28,600
tether our character's personal journeys
to the action of the plot.

230
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,540
We don't feel the proper emotions.
Anxiety,

231
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,140
fear relief.
I have none of it washes over us.

232
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,390
Sure.
We see Diana and Cyborg.

233
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,253
Finally coming out of hiding.
We hear aqua man talk about friendship 

234
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,200
or regrets or something.
I don't want to die.

235
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,480
I'm young,
but I want to do.

236
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,413
I just feel like we're really embraced 
Fiordland I've been my whole life 

237
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,290
because these aren't developed and tied 
to the action of the plot.

238
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,363
There's no catharsis.
We as the audience just can't muster up 

239
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,760
the energy to care and we really can't 
emphasize this enough.

240
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,670
This is exactly what infinity war excels
at.

241
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,730
Consider the relationship between Tony 
Stark and Peter Parker,

242
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:12,760
which is developed hand in hand with the
main plot.

243
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,923
More often than not,
our duo find some subs bickering like 

244
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:18,700
father and son in the face of enemies.
After all,

245
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,950
Tony Wants Peter Safe.
I know what you're going to say.

246
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,750
You should not be here.
I was going to go home.

247
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,633
I don't want to hit it with such a long 
way down and I just thought about 

248
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,753
shooting.
Now I got to hear this side of the ship 

249
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,590
and this shoot is ridiculous.
The intuitive,

250
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,000
by the way.
So if anything,

251
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,820
it's kind of your fault that I'm here.
What did you do?

252
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,880
Say I take that back and this 
relationship affects the action.

253
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,200
Like when Tony plays hardball for 
Peter's life,

254
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,260
when they're both mistaken for Santos,
his henchmen.

255
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,270
Tell me where the girl is,
where I swear to you,

256
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,270
I'm going to French fry,
this little freak steward.

257
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,870
Just shoot my gun on.
Blessed him.

258
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,830
Let's go.
More importantly because we see Tony and

259
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,250
Peter's dynamic grow and change over the
course of the film.

260
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,353
We're invested in them,
which makes moments like this 

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,320
legitimately Cathartic

262
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,120
in contrast,
all the resolution scenes of the Justice

263
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,880
League characters feel obligatory and 
phoned in.

264
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,953
It's the difference between feeling 
genuine emotion in the theater and 

265
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:18,010
leaving saying,
well,

266
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:22,540
I guess that was a movie in the end.
Justice League stands as a case study of

267
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,380
a film that feels to balance two very 
important things,

268
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,363
character and plot,
which I suppose makes sense when you 

269
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:34,300
consider how they had to establish all 
these new franchises for movies to come,

270
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,940
but what do you guys think?
Is dramatic action,

271
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:37,774
the best lens to focus this problem or 
are there bigger issues lurking in the 

272
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:43,540
justice league?
Let us know what you think and hey,
