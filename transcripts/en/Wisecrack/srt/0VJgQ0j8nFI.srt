1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,030
We humans live on earth that we all know
and we can look up at the stars there,

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,680
stars that are close to us and our stars
that are further away belonging to other

3
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,234
galaxies and the stars that are 
extremely far away belonging to 

4
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:25,710
extremely far away galaxies.
Now for about a century.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,873
We know that we see that far away.
Galaxies which are islands of billions 

6
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,910
of stars,
far away.

7
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,744
Galaxies seemed to move away from us.
We see that the light that reaches us 

8
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,963
coming from those galaxies is what they,
what the scientists called red shifted 

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,270
meaning something has been stretched in 
between those galaxies and us.

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,690
What has been stretched is the distance 
that separates us from those galaxies.

11
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,290
As time goes by,
all the distances in space stretch,

12
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,610
they expand.
That's what we call the expansion of the

13
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:09,444
universe.
It is not actually that those faraway 

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,740
stars or get x,
he's moved away from us.

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,100
It is the distance itself that 
increases.

16
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,430
There is more space and time in between 
them now than there was before.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,540
Just to make that point clear,
that's when you,

18
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,120
when you are from on earth and look at 
the stars,

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,193
the expansion of the universe makes all 
the far away galaxies look as if they 

20
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,900
were moving away,
but if you imagined that you were living

21
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,340
somewhere else in another galaxy far 
away and the universe from there,

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,683
all the stars and galaxies that are far 
away would again be moving away from 

23
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,000
you.
To summarize,

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,120
the expansion of the universe means that
distances increase with time.

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,340
That's not something that is completely 
crazy to understand.

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,510
If you imagine that the universe started
with the big bang,

27
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,690
meaning that everything we can see in 
outer space right now was condensed in a

28
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,450
very much smaller volume a long time 
ago.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,670
Then somehow some energy got released 
and everything expended.

30
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,890
Okay,
do you universe group,

31
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,653
but if you think about that carefully,
what that means is that somehow this 

32
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,780
expansion,
these blow up,

33
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,280
this big bang thing should slow down 
with time.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,470
When you have an explosion on earth,
the objects that are thrown away,

35
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:44,730
they slow down because there is friction
because there is something happening.

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,810
Objects don't keep moving in flying 
forever.

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,140
They slow down in the universe.
It should be the same.

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,213
In some sense,
gravity should keep things from moving 

39
00:02:56,881 --> 00:03:00,250
too far away from one another.
If is enough gravity.

40
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,084
For instance,
the expansions should slow down after a 

41
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:06,130
while,
but there you go.

42
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,080
In 1998,
uh,

43
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,973
astronomers discovered that it is 
actually the other way around in space 

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,830
looking at far away galaxies,
they,

45
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,930
they realized that the expansion,
the rate of expansion is accelerating.

46
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,530
So there is a forest pushing away.

47
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,880
The faraway galaxy is faster and faster 
with time,

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,940
and that's something that gravity can 
not explain.

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Gravity pulls things back towards one 
another.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,373
And this accelerated expansion means 
that there is another force before that 

51
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:44,020
has been called dark energy.
This discovery of dark energy,

52
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:49,021
of the accelerated expansion of our 
universe did change something already in

53
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,894
the way we picture the future of our 
universe for a long time since we know 

54
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,693
of the Big Bang,
there were basically two possibilities 

55
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,204
for the future of our universe.
The first one is that there is so much 

56
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,000
matter in that that despite the 
expansion,

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,433
gravity would work like some kind of 
rubber band and would bring everything 

58
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:14,911
back into what we call a big crunch,
that the everything will be pulled,

59
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:19,810
two words each other at some stage,
and the expansion would go the other way

60
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,530
around and we would have the the precise
opposite as the big bang,

61
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,693
which was called the big crunch.
The discovery of the accelerated 

62
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:32,521
expansion kind of ruled that possibility
out in the sense that gravity will never

63
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,410
be strong enough to pull things back 
into a big crunch.

64
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,710
We are the.
We are more into a scenario in which our

65
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,854
universe will keep expanding,
will keep being getting bigger and 

66
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,394
bigger forever.
That is what we can expect as of today 

67
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,580
for the future of our universe.
