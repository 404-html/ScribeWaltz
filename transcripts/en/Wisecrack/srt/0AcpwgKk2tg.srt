1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,480
He only was removed from office or 
resigned from office a few months ago,

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,300
a formidable prime minister and the 
formidable politician,

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,780
and I suspect the Labour Party will 
regret removing men,

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,280
a very middle class Britain

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,033
with a w taken over a very strong 
economy and he'd left the same strong 

6
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,284
economy.
He made some genuinely very brilliant 

7
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,030
reforms and his record will bear 
watching what has saddened,

8
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,983
uh,
what blocked that record or harm it is 

9
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,524
Iraq.
The fact that he was so willing to look 

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,310
to some of us just fall in line with 
President Bush,

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,533
I think Margaret Thatcher would have 
stood up to President Bush and said so 

12
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:04,200
far and no further.
And if you take away Iraq,

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,250
which you can't from the legacy,
uh,

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,990
it's a very impressive premiership,
but he will be settled historically.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,260
He will be saddled with Iraq.
