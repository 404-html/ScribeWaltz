00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,030
This video was sponsored by the purge on
USA network.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,850
What's up wise crack jared here.
As you know,

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:06,684
we're pretty big fans of the purge,
so we were stoked when USA came to us 

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:13,980
and gave us a sneak peek of the first 
two episodes of the new purge TV series,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,490
a 10 episode television event,
Tuesdays on USA network.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,623
We've already discussed the 
socioeconomic themes prevalent in the 

7
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:21,564
purge films,
but the show has already shown some 

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,880
promise in extending these themes in 
some interesting ways.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,740
So for those of you excited about the 
show,

10
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,574
we're going to go through a couple of 
key philosophical and sociological 

11
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:35,160
concepts to frame the way you watch it.
So without further ado,

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:35,994
welcome to this wise crack quick take on
what you need to know before you watch 

13
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,354
the purge on USA.
As we've discussed in our philosophy of 

14
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,654
videos,
the purge largely functions as an 

15
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,054
extended metaphor for the way entire 
groups of people become disposable in 

16
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,280
our current economic environment.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,503
In this case,
the new founding fathers literally 

18
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:53,904
specify one day out of the year the the 
rich can eradicate the superfluous poor 

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,520
who are deemed economic burdens as the 
Revolutionary Dante Bishop says,

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,600
it's a lot easier to just kill the poor 
than to provide them with health care,

21
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,860
welfare,
housing,

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,753
et Cetera.
We also see how the purge can promote 

23
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,510
the interests of the well to do in 
society.

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,990
We're actively profit off all the chaos 
and the first film,

25
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:20,130
the upper middle class San and family 
makes bank selling home security systems

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,730
to everyone in their gated community in 
the purge TV show.

27
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,900
All of this is still front and center.
The rich and well connected are throwing

28
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,734
parties from secured houses while 
everyone else is forced to fend for 

29
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,560
themselves,
especially in the inner cities.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,753
But one of the things that's really 
interesting about the TV series is that 

31
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,160
it explores how order emerges in an ard.

32
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,720
Now,
if that sounds confusing,

33
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
just stick with me.
Consider how the purge is basically the 

34
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:50,871
temporary suspension of society.
It's laws and norms and institutions all

35
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,430
go out the window once the clock strikes
seven.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,090
But in the TV show we see how even in 
anarchy,

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,290
different kinds of social bonds will 
arise amidst the anarchic murder.

38
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,290
Thon one of those seedlings of order is 
a market,

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,020
a means for people to exchange goods and
services.

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,700
This one just exists for only 12 hours.
Now the purchase always been lucrative,

41
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,880
don't get me wrong,
but so far we've mostly seen profit that

42
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:19,020
happens before or after the purge,
like home security systems,

43
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,280
guns,
insurance.

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,383
You get the idea in the show,
we see how people coordinate actions by 

45
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,900
skipping the brute force and using good 
old fashioned cash.

46
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,943
For example,
we learned many cab drivers work on 

47
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,284
perch night to take advantage of the 
surge pricing and how we're going all 

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:33,830
night.

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,960
You passing guys do,
he's driving around crazy.

50
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,430
But I've heard surge money elsewhere and
assassin takes contracts to kill people,

51
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,383
but only during the hours in which it's 
legal is conspiracy to commit murder 

52
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,580
still a crime if the murder happens on 
the purge.

53
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,653
And do you declare that on a 10 99 well,
I digress with all the poor people the 

54
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,274
purchase got rid of.
There's also a lot more capital just 

55
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:57,330
sitting in the pockets of the new 
founding fathers.

56
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:00,800
Big Wigs that us,
we follow a couple going to an nff,

57
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:04,150
a purge party for the sole purpose of 
stomaching,

58
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:04,984
the brutal in difference of the elites 
in order to Schmooze and NFFA party 

59
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,914
member to invest in their new projects.
And no doubt we'll probably see a fair 

60
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,030
amount of insider trading happening at 
these 1% or purge parties.

61
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,163
So money is one way to organize things 
instead of beating people to get what 

62
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:21,160
you want.

63
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,993
Markets can facilitate exchange,
but there's one other way that TV show 

64
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,260
explores order amidst the anarchy.
Social contracts at its core,

65
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,094
the idea of a social contract does that 
we sacrifice certain rights to enjoy 

66
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,114
living in a society.
So even if I want to steal candy from 

67
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:37,654
the children as a hobby,
I have to give up this past time to 

68
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,894
enjoy it.
Not living in the purge for 365 days a 

69
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,090
year.
The purge films of largely emphasize the

70
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,640
way humanity acts when the law is 
suspended,

71
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,320
when the social contract ceases,
when the clock strikes seven and without

72
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,154
threat of legal retribution,
people revert to their primal selves as 

73
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,964
they release the beast.
It's a specific narrative of human 

74
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,174
nature proposed by philosopher Thomas 
Hobbs to theorize that before 

75
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,074
governments came along,
life was basically the Beta version of 

76
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,480
the curve,
but it's a narrative to purge.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,313
Franchise has been challenging.
We've been in the first purge or the 

78
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,560
government needed to sow discord to get 
people hyped about murder nine.

79
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,843
While the show certainly has strong 
elements of a hobby and war of all 

80
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,670
against all,
it's not quite so simple,

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,773
rather than everyone reverting to their 
allegedly natural and violet selves 

82
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:32,950
without the threat of below man,
we see that most people just want to get

83
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,784
along.
Many employed the purge altogether and 

84
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,270
even within the purge we see a kind of 
social contract starting to emerge.

85
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,900
For instance,
paramedics are left alone not because of

86
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,240
some law,
but rather as a social norm.

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,790
Safe with us were off limits.
I'm renting person.

88
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,813
Others signed literal contracts that 
forfeit their rights to purge as they 

89
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:56,850
attend parties or pull all nighters in 
lockdown office buildings.

90
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,903
Once the Burj begins,
his 38th floor will be locked out as a 

91
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,303
safety security on all workers including
the both of you have signed waivers 

92
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:06,040
giving up their rights to purge on this 
floor for the entire evening.

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,953
However,
we see a bar that suspends all purging 

94
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:11,910
privileges based only out of mutual 
respect.

95
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:16,320
Slash sphere for the owner of the bar 
somewhat like hops is Leviathan,

96
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,060
but unwritten laws in the form of social
norms aren't always so rosy.

97
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,163
The show looks at the darker side as a 
woman having worked her ass off for 

98
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:29,910
years is teased with the opportunity to 
make partner at her prestigious firm,

99
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,013
but the unspoken rule that to her 
progress is her unwillingness to 

100
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:37,380
reciprocate her bosses.
Creepy propositions,

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,393
although he hasn't come out and set it,
she knows the only thing standing 

102
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:45,030
between her and her dream is her 
unwillingness to put out.

103
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,163
We're only two episodes in the seeing is
beholds 10 episode series focuses on 

104
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:50,454
purge tonight.
We can definitely expect to see more 

105
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,080
commentaries on human nature in the face
of chaos.

106
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,120
So thanks again to the purge on USA 
network for sponsoring this video.

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,830
Also,
I'm going to leave you guys for the list

108
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,950
of things I would do during a purge 
import exotic pets.

109
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,843
Cut The tag off my mattress.
Arrange large purchases with no sales 

110
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,140
tax.
File my taxes.

111
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,410
Roger gently get like $1,000
worth of fireworks.

112
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,540
No pick up my dog's poop from the 
sidewalk.

113
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,260
A ton of copyright infringement.
File patents for things I didn't invent.

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,810
Reverse engineer or popular game and 
sell it for cheaper.

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,290
And definitely,
definitely double parking.

116
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,230
So be sure to watch the purge Tuesdays 
on USA network and as always,

117
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,243
peace guys.
