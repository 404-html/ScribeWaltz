1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,210
Conventional wisdom or has had at the,
we have no teper source of electricity,

2
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:16,140
then call and impact the have no 
reliable suffers.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,033
And part of the reason we have that 
belief system is because environmental 

4
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,871
as have generally pushed when power and 
for the world tykes which can be a small

5
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,950
percentage,
five,

6
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,880
10,
15,

7
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:34,881
maybe even 20% of our electricity supply
and that makes them huge markets.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,750
But 10,
15,

9
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,720
20% of our supply is not a climate 
change solution.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,410
There are great investment opportunities
and we invest in them,

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,053
but we have to be clear they want solve 
the climate change problem for that you 

12
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,690
need something that can have the kind of
reliability,

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,550
independent ability call has.
You can sign a 20 year contract with the

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,384
utility and say something other than 
I'll ship your power when the wind 

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,120
blows.
It doesn't quite work for utility.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,913
Uh,
there are newer technologies coming 

17
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,370
along that solve that problem.
Do your terminal solves that problem.

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,204
You can deliver power when the utility 
needs new kinds of technologies like 

19
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,020
solar thermal and Florida just 
announced,

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,883
uh,
the use of those technologies for a 

21
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,224
massive solar project in Florida,
not considered a traditional solar 

22
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:27,804
strength state.
These technologies can have what's 

23
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,590
called dispatchable power.
When the utilities customers need power,

24
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:39,330
you can supply it to the utility so they
can supply it to their customers and not

25
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,170
make excuses like it's not sunny or the 
wind doesn't blow.

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,160
And that kind of utility grade power,
power,

27
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:51,450
I call it punk power is absolutely key 
to cracking call.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,940
Not only that,
it has to be cheap enough.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,553
Fortunately,
the cost of coal based power has been 

30
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,284
going up.
Environmental Regulations for criteria 

31
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,704
pollutants like sulfur dioxide in mode 
creating have been getting more 

32
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,514
stringent.

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,803
And because of that call now it costs 
quite a lot more to preger coal based 

34
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:11,874
power costs a lot more to produce than 
it did five years ago or even two years 

35
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,810
ago.
Uh,

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,103
that gives us an opportunity.
The coal industry is talking about next 

37
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:22,944
generation coal power plant technology 
called IGCC and IGCC carbon 

38
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:32,610
sequestration is what they think is the 
solution.

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,410
The so called clean called switch.
That solution should be attempted.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,273
We should try it.
My personal belief is solar thermal 

41
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:45,690
technologies and geothermal technologies
will be cheaper than those technologies.

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,440
And because they will be cheaper,
they'll beat them in the marketplace.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,730
And we will,
uh,

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,130
find,
uh,

45
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,960
that we don't need as much coal for 
power generation.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,870
There are other good uses for calls,
so I'm not against cove,

47
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,170
but it shouldn't end up in our 
atmosphere first.

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,513
You know,
I believe having watched technology 

49
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,890
development over the last three to five 
years,

50
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,043
that could a,
the biggest problem is having people 

51
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:20,731
believe that we can replace oil with a 
cheaper alternative.

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,403
That we can replace IGCC corn plants 
with a cheaper source of power that are 

53
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,400
more renewable,
100% renewable.

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,900
Having the world believe that is,
I think the biggest problem.

55
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,630
We still need to make more progress in 
technology,

56
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:41,840
but I do believe it's a mostly solved 
problems.
