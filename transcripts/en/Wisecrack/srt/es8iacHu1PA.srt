1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,110
This video is brought to you by skill 
share.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,073
Okay.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,310
What's up guys?
Jared again.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,323
Today we're talking about the Walt 
Disney of animate hi Yao Miyazaki with 

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,730
11 feature films and over 125 major 
awards under his belt.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,060
Miyazaki's become a household name even 
in the West.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,163
So what gives the films of me as Aki and
his team of bad asses at Studio Ghibli 

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,683
that extra Miyuzaki feel well beneath 
all the curse tentacle pigs and giant 

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,374
cat bear things.
There's a cohesive philosophy at play 

10
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,100
here.
The Japanese religion of Shinto welcome,

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,953
this wisecrack condition on the 
philosophy of Miyazaki and you know the 

12
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:41,784
drill spoilers ahead.
A recurrent theme throughout all of me 

13
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:47,740
as archies films is a love for nature.
At times.

14
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:51,370
This can be fairly over the top,
such as in the battle between the humans

15
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,230
and the forest and princess monotone.
Okay.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,123
What I want is for the humans and the 
forest to live in peace or the battle 

17
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:00,300
between the various armies and bugs and 
Nasca of the Valley of the wind.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,560
Humans cannot live.

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,490
Actually let's roll the opening credits 
for Nasca for a second.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,630
Yup.
There it is.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,620
The throne even comes with the World 
Wildlife Fund stamp of approval.

22
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,130
While we could chalk all these moments 
up to me as Aki being a tree hugger,

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,800
seriously,
he's actually opening a nature sanctuary

24
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:21,800
later this year.
We think it has more to do with Shinto,

25
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,760
which holds a deep respect for nature.
For the uninitiated,

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,623
Shinto is an ancient Japanese religion 
that believes we share our world with a 

27
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:33,500
variety of gods and spirits called Kami.
Importantly,

28
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:34,334
comey is both singular and plural,
referring not only to the myriad of 

29
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:38,714
spirits in the world,
but also the divine essence that 

30
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:41,864
connects all things.
This interconnectedness is critical to 

31
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:48,560
understanding the religion,
whereas you and I might see a giant tree

32
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:49,460
and think,
wow,

33
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,170
that's a big country.
A shintoist might recognize it as a your

34
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,120
machito or an object in which a god can 
reside.

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,280
It's no longer just nature,
but part of the divine fabric of reality

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,263
and as such deserves our respect.
And while Japan is one of the least 

37
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:06,464
religious countries in the world,
over 80% of its population participates 

38
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,720
in Shinto traditions.
Seriously.

39
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:15,320
The only thing Japan has more of than 
shrines are vending machines.

40
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,230
But how does this all relate to nature 
and Miyazaki?

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,423
Well,
according to historian Lynn white 

42
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,740
religion plays a large part in shaping a
culture is treatment of the environment.

43
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,070
For example,
Judeo Christian tradition state that man

44
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:28,904
has dominion over fish of the sea and 
over fowl of the air and over every 

45
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,164
living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Basically in the west nature has 

46
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:39,980
historically been our bitch.
But in Shinto,

47
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,830
because everything possesses a spiritual
component,

48
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,783
the religion is non anthropocentric.
Humans aren't at the center of the 

49
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,640
universe.
And for our boy Miyazaki,

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,533
that means that his films deal a lot 
with peace and loving between human in 

51
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:54,854
nature.
So if you're wondering why the 

52
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:58,250
protagonist from NASA,
the Valley of the wind,

53
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:01,990
continually to make peace with some 
pretty terrifying bugs.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,033
Well there you go.

55
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,410
Please forgive us for disturbing your 
nest.

56
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,340
We're very sorry.
We are not your enemies.

57
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,630
We mean you no harm.

58
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,603
Consider my neighbor Totoro when sisters
Sawicki and May Coosa Kabe moved to an 

59
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,464
idealic village out in the country,
they find themselves living alongside a 

60
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:23,380
whole host of spirits in their attic.
For example,

61
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,730
running around the go,
hey,

62
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,840
or a charm that blesses a house is a 
swarm of little suit sprites.

63
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,010
But instead of portraying these adorable
little guys as other worldly,

64
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,410
the local wise woman treats them like 
familiar wildlife or a kind of ghost,

65
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:41,890
then don't worry dear then nothing to be
afraid to have.

66
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,730
If they decide you're nice people,
they won't harm you.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,830
And after a I live,
just go wait.

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,753
In this world,
spirits aren't something to fear but 

69
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,574
rather a part of everyday life.
This casual acceptance of spirits place 

70
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,254
in the world and the respect they 
deserve is captured in small moments 

71
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,124
throughout the film.
Like when sought ski gives thanks to a 

72
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:02,464
local shrine for offering her shelter 
from the rain or when the Coosa Kabe 

73
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,394
family pays respects to the your Shiro 
in which the god of the forest Todaro 

74
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,324
lives.
Thank you for watching over May and 

75
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,874
making us feel so welcome here.
Please continue to look after us and 

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,033
it's through befriending these spirits,
particularly the large totaro that our 

77
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,054
heroes resolve the films.
Big crisis when may goes missing at the 

78
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,400
end,
it's towed.

79
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:31,120
Rowe who helps sought ski find her with 
the help of this weird cat bus thing.

80
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,190
I seriously,
I don't know what to call that.

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,793
By having his protagonist respect both 
the spirit and the wildlife they 

82
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:41,544
inhabit.
Miyuzaki inverts traditional Western 

83
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,930
views toward the environment in the 
west.

84
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:49,440
We've historically looked at the land in
terms of its instrumental value,

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,110
what it can do for us.
For example,

86
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,180
aristotle remarked in his book,
politics.

87
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,070
Nature has made all things specifically 
for the sake of man and for us red,

88
00:04:59,071 --> 00:04:59,904
white and blue blooded Americans.
We can see this in the concept of 

89
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,204
manifest destiny II,
how we must spread out across the 

90
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:08,790
country and convert all this nature into
usable land.

91
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,923
In short,
we're consumers and the earth is our 

92
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,290
Walmart.
However,

93
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,110
if we factor in that the land is imbued 
with spirits,

94
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,100
then we have to concede that the earth 
might have some intrinsic value,

95
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,821
I.
E.

96
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,654
Value for its own sake,
much like haunt formulated that people 

97
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,440
or more broadly rational agents must be 
treated as an end,

98
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,760
never merely as a means.

99
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,940
So too must the land which is full of 
thinking,

100
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:37,410
rational spirits be treated as an end,
not as a means.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,513
And it's in how these two perspectives 
on nature fail to meet that we find the 

102
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:45,090
root of conflict in me as archies films.
For example,

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,510
look at Ponyo Miyazaki's take on the 
little mermaid in it.

104
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,373
The Magician Fujimoto opposes his 
daughter Ponyo his desire to become a 

105
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,920
human on the grounds that they use the 
ocean for their own gain.

106
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,903
In fact,
the only why Ponyo ends up meeting the 

107
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,624
little boys so ski in the first place is
because she gets swept up by a passing 

108
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,830
ship,
trawling the ocean,

109
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,783
or in layman's terms,
when a ship essentially rakes the ocean 

110
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,934
with a giant net destroying reefs and 
underwater habitats all for a quick 

111
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,294
buck.
When Fujimoto finally recovers Ponyo he 

112
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,310
offers some pretty scathing criticism of
mankind.

113
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,900
What do you know about humans?
The score in the sea.

114
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,960
They treat your home like the empty 
black songs.

115
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,540
That was one slung.
I go,

116
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,374
what she wanted myself.
I had to leave that all behind to serve 

117
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,340
the earth.
That's right.

118
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:34,490
Apparently you can't love the ocean and 
be human at the same time.

119
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,503
And to be fair,
this clash between intrinsic and 

120
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,114
instrumental value has some pretty dire 
consequences because ponos father 

121
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,760
refuses to let his daughter become a 
human.

122
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,430
And because Ponyo refuses to go back to 
being a fish,

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,910
the natural order of the world begins to
fall apart.

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,510
The moon falls closer to the sea.
The waves take on a life of their own,

125
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,403
and half the town looks like a coloring 
book page inspired by the day after 

126
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,723
tomorrow.
But so ca ponyo manage to stave off the 

127
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,933
end of days by proving that humans can 
love nature for itself in the most 

128
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:05,684
literal way possible.
After helping so skate traverse the 

129
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,684
flooded island to get back to his mom,
Ponyo uses up all her magical power and 

130
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,290
returns to being a fish when asked by 
pose mother,

131
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,930
the spirit of the earth and goddess of 
mercy herself.

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,420
If so,
ski knew that Ponyo was a fish and could

133
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,254
love her.
Anyway.

134
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,183
He responds,

135
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,033
I love

136
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,903
so demonstrates that humans can 
intrinsically value nature by actually 

137
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:29,354
falling in love with the fish.
Relieved Ponyo his mother puts her 

138
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,684
daughter in a bubble and with a kiss 
from so skate Ponyo transforms 

139
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:39,470
permanently into a real girl,
thereby putting the world at ease again,

140
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,723
while Ponyo chooses to ground this 
mismatch of values and a Romeo and 

141
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,310
Juliet sorta way more often than not in 
Miyazaki films,

142
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:47,144
we see it embodied in the conflict 
between nature and technology and 

143
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:50,864
perhaps nowhere is this interplay more 
noticeable than in me is Aki is darkest 

144
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,950
work.
Princess modern.

145
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,300
Okay.
In the film prints,

146
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,153
Asha Taka travel to the industrial 
holdout irontown to understand what's 

147
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,080
causing the great spirits of the forest 
to become cursed.

148
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,170
As it turns out,
irontown under the leadership of Lady of

149
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,004
OCI has been cutting down the forest in 
order to bolster its own supply of iron 

150
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,330
in choosing their own material gain over
the sanctity of the forest.

151
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,223
The residents of irontown have started 
an all out war with the god of the 

152
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,034
mountain,
a war which Asha Taka is determined to 

153
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:21,914
stop.
What's particularly interesting is how 

154
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:24,464
the townspeople viewed this,
these four station in relation to the 

155
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,540
idea of progress before lady of Bocce 
came along,

156
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,390
they tell Asha Taka that it was 
impossible to settle here.

157
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,870
The problem was before we could dig for 
the iron,

158
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,650
we had to clear away the forest and 
that's what made the board angry.

159
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,803
Hello?

160
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,373
Then one day the lady bull,
she came along with their warriors in 

161
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:56,254
the right.
Awesome.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,140
This last point is important.
The town's people view iron and guns and

163
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,033
more broadly rationality as a vehicle 
for progress with science and 

164
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:07,534
rationality on their side.
Humans think they can live anywhere and 

165
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:11,164
to anything,
but it's exactly this mindset that 

166
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:14,284
philosophy's Ron Swanson.
Martin Heidegger says leads to a warped 

167
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:18,634
idea of reality because we're focused on
viewing nature only through the lens of 

168
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:23,284
science and technology.
We're blinded to the true essence of 

169
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,940
things.
So trees become,

170
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:28,774
would beaches become iron sand and a 
giant walking God becomes a big pain in 

171
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,320
the ass.
Nothing is sacred anymore.

172
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,930
And this is especially true to lady of 
Boshi.

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,390
She's not even afraid of that God,
that woman.

174
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,283
And while the forward march of 
technology has brought some good to the 

175
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,263
townspeople,
empowering women and giving work to the 

176
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:46,954
literal lepers of society,
it also comes with some pretty big 

177
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,240
drawbacks.
Namely angry wolves,

178
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:55,150
bores monkeys,
and some pretty nasty curses.

179
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,193
So what's the overall takeaway here are 
all of me is Auggie's films just thinly 

180
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:03,160
veiled odes to nature.
And it's the message really as simple as

181
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:05,830
trees are good in technology is bad.
Well,

182
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:08,470
let's not go full thorough just yet.
After all,

183
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,333
nature can be pretty damn scary.
And me as Aki films in the futuristic 

184
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:15,820
apocalyptic nightmare that is NASA,
the Valley of the wind,

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,060
the humans live in a world invaded by a 
toxic jungle,

186
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,350
told to believe these spores can kill me
without a mask.

187
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,343
Oh yeah.
And did we mention these swarms of 

188
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:30,770
massive killer insects that live in it?
Similarly,

189
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:31,604
spirits aren't always your friend in 
Miyazaki's most famous work spirited 

190
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:35,714
away.
The little girl Chihiro enters a 

191
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:37,724
mysterious deserted town with her 
parents only for them to be turned into 

192
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:43,340
pigs and you hero's quest to change her 
parents back.

193
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,050
Chanters a service of an evil witch you 
Baba and runs into this unruly patron,

194
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:53,051
no face.
Yep.

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,630
Not exactly a friendly figure like 
Totoro,

196
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,840
but if nature and spirits aren't always 
good,

197
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,980
then it stands to reason that society 
and technology aren't always bad.

198
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,690
Case and point in the wind rises 
Miyazaki's last film technology is never

199
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:10,300
presented as something to fear.
In fact,

200
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,163
it's freak events of nature like a 
massive earthquake and disease that 

201
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,840
creates a lot of the conflict in this 
world.

202
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,350
As the protagonist juro learns in one of
his many dream sequences,

203
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,860
airplanes for him aren't the same as 
lady [inaudible] guns.

204
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,270
They're not meant to do battle or to 
further materialistic gains as his idol.

205
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,610
Giovanni caproni states airplanes are 
not tools for,

206
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,070
they are not for making money and plains
are beautiful.

207
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,640
To me,
engineer's turn dreams into reality.

208
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,380
In the end,
what it all seems to come down to is the

209
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:47,300
idea of respect and balance.
In Shinto certain actions create a sense

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,193
of ritual purity.
They give peace of mind to your own 

211
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,404
spirit and those around you,
the dead must be for their souls to be 

212
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:55,174
at peace.
Local gods and wildlife must be shown 

213
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,080
respect and their sacrifices even for 
the benefit of mankind must be honored.

214
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,430
If not these angered spirits can become 
cursed or you know this.

215
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,103
It's not a matter of land being good or 
technology being bad so much as it is 

216
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:17,430
about living in harmony with the natural
world to hammer this point home.

217
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:19,920
Let's have a quick look at castle in the
sky,

218
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,993
which follows the young boy Pazo and the
princess sheet does quest to find the 

219
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:27,480
long lost flying city of La Pito.
As it turns out,

220
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,373
she does ambulate points the way to the 
city and with the help of some friendly 

221
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,674
air pirates,
the duo racist to reach Lapino before 

222
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:36,030
the military,
but when the pair of finally arrived,

223
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:38,850
the city's not what they expect in the 
century.

224
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:42,930
Since it's abandonment lop,
UTA has become overgrown with plants and

225
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:43,764
those scary robots in the distance while
turns out they're more of the big 

226
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,960
friendly giant variety.
Instead of killing people,

227
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:52,320
they tend to the wildlife and much like 
in the Shinto tradition,

228
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,210
they also pay their respects to the 
debt.

229
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,270
You've picked another flower for the 
grave.

230
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,350
How kind of you?

231
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,433
In essence lobby that has become the 
perfect synthesis of nature and 

232
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,334
technology,
a giant tree even growing around its 

233
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:05,424
main crystal and power source.
It's only when the army arrived and 

234
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,204
particularly Mooska that this status is 
broken as Mooska violently ripped 

235
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,230
through the vegetation that has taken 
over Lapi does control room.

236
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,333
He attempts to turn the city into a 
massive weapon watching goose because 

237
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,234
disregard for the natural world.
She to finally realizes why her people 

238
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:26,340
left die in the first place.

239
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,430
Now I understand why the people of 
Laputa vanished.

240
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,623
There was a song from my home in the 
valley have gone to with it explains 

241
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:36,210
everything it says,
take root in the ground,

242
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,103
live in harmony with the wind.
Plant your seeds in the winter and 

243
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,510
rejoice with the birds.
And the coming of spring,

244
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,883
no matter how many weapons you have,
no matter how great your technology 

245
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:50,820
might be,
the world cannot live without love,

246
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,360
determined to stop Mooska Pausey when 
she needs it,

247
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:54,194
then recite the forbidden spell instead 
of letting Musco break the balance of 

248
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,990
the world,
they destroy lapita all together.

249
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,100
As the city crumbles though the tree and
the power source remain intact.

250
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,850
Soaring through the sky together.
So what do you think wise crack.

251
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,280
Should we value wildlife for its own 
sake,

252
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,114
spirits or not?
Or should we value it for what it can 

253
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:15,350
offer us?
Maybe if not materially,

254
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:20,351
at least in quality of life or is it 
about a balance in all things regardless

255
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,374
of the answer.
A great way to nurture a connection to 

256
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:27,080
nature is by setting up a tiny garden at
home and with skill share.
