1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,110
Before getting into a negotiation,
it's very important to set a floor and a

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,990
ceiling so you know where to move,
right?

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,220
Because if you don't,
you can be manipulated and you can,

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,380
you know,
loose yourself in the emotions.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,883
Because if you're a good negotiator,
you will obviously try at least to be 

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,250
completely disconnected emotionally from
the deal and negotiation itself.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Although you will play emotional.
So if you are not upset,

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,590
you can play upsets.
Um,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,900
but none of that matters unless you 
don't,

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,880
unless you don't have a floor and a 
ceiling.

11
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,160
So you need to know if you go under the 
floor,

12
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:38,994
you need to walk out or you know,
and the negotiation and at the ceiling 

13
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,240
you need to know to accept so you can 
close the deal.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,770
Time is very interesting when it comes 
to negotiation.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,340
I always say in real estate at time 
kills everything,

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,623
all deals.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,200
But this a little bit of time,
a few seconds,

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,830
minutes,
or sometimes a couple of hours depending

19
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:06,780
on the situation,
which you can use and delay to get where

20
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,950
you want because people get frustrated 
to a certain point and in a good way.

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,830
If you don't give the information right 
away,

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,390
just hold it back tiny,
tiny bits and make them wait.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,840
That could be good.
As an example,

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,590
when I go into an apartment and the 
seller is,

25
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:28,600
they're always asking me at the end of 
the appointment,

26
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,680
so Frederick,
what is my penthouse worth?

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,320
I never ever give a price in the 
apartments.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,060
One because I want to do my research and
really go home and think about it.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,640
And I don't want to be drawn into any 
excitement,

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,700
which I could potentially be cause it's 
so beautiful.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,850
But it's also the purpose of this 
discussion.

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,883
Having them wait three and a half hours 
for an email to come with a price will 

33
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:02,550
make them want it more.
And then having it come in writing,

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,900
we'll feel more substantial and real 
because it's coming in an email.

35
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,734
He had to wait for it.

36
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,973
Okay.
