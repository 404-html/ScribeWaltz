1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,653
Hey guys,
so pilot season continues here at wise 

2
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,094
crack,
so this one is special to us for a 

3
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,460
couple of reasons.
First of all,

4
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:11,294
this is the first time we're going to be
talking about real world events rather 

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,410
than focusing on media.
Secondly,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,453
we're bringing the vision of one of my 
favorite artists to life is the girl 

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:19,394
went to college with,
her name is Tyler Rice and we're super 

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,630
excited to have her aesthetic be part of
the wise crack family,

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,540
but also I wanted to introduce the voice
of this pilot,

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,523
Jacob,
who is my co founder who created 

11
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:31,400
wisecrack with me about four years ago.
Hey guys,

12
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:33,050
we're really pumped to get this out to 
you guys,

13
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:33,884
so let us know what you think in the 
comments and make sure you let Larry 

14
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,810
know to see you guys later.
Enjoy the show.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,880
Have you seen the news lately?
It sucks.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,913
Today's media landscape gives people 
more ways than ever to hear only the 

17
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,754
things they want to hear.
When confronted with ideas that 

18
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,710
challenged their beliefs,
many react with outrage,

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,370
censorship and recently cries of fake 
news.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,220
This trend may seem to have popped out 
of nowhere,

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,353
but this was actually predicted a long 
time ago in a book you've probably read 

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,660
Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 400.

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,180
Do you want in case you slept through 
middle school English.

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,283
The book depicts a dark future,
or firemen have graduated from saving 

25
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,244
cats.
The torching books in an attempt to 

26
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:22,734
silence any troubling ideas Fahrenheit 
is usually interpreted as an attack on 

27
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:27,804
government censorship,
especially since Brad re wrote the book 

28
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,310
in the midst of Mccarthy's war on 
communism,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,833
but there's actually someone else 
Bradbury blames for the dystopia his 

30
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:37,980
characters live in you.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,150
Well not only you,
but all of us.

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,003
See in the book the main characters 
informed that it was the public that 

33
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:46,844
censored themselves.
It all started with the advent of mass 

34
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:50,564
media technology advanced to such a 
degree that people struggled to keep up 

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,540
information,
rushed in from every direction,

36
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,780
overwhelming the population to quell 
their anxiety.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,390
People focused on smaller pieces of 
information.

38
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,243
Beatty,
captain of the firefighters describes 

39
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:06,524
this change,
how media has been reduced from 

40
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:12,350
cumbersome novels to the gag.
The snap ending one column,

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,490
two sentences,
a headline than midair all vanishes just

42
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,100
like that we consume and forget and 
consume.

43
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,390
Again,
rinse,

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,660
wash,
repeat the mind drinks less and less

45
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,240
soon.
People became addicts,

46
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,910
conditioned to feel pleasure from 
frivolous content.

47
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,580
Anything thought provoking became 
downright painful.

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,073
As a result,
people censored themselves from any 

49
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,430
challenging ideas they sought to be 
pacified,

50
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,700
numbed and validated soundbites,
factoids,

51
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:44,420
and vapid drama,
blurring out any troubling ideas blaring

52
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:45,350
out reality.

53
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,063
We see similar patterns with the rise of
social networking and the feed news 

54
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:55,680
story after new story that generates as 
you scroll video after video,

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,520
meme after meme,
directly fed and programs to your liking

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,390
just as long as you continue scrolling 
in Fahrenheit,

57
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,463
the media concluded that it could 
attract the biggest audience by routing 

58
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,370
itself,
if anything controversial,

59
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,960
effectively ceding control of its 
content to outrage our media.

60
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,250
Saturated society is an extension of 
Bradbury's vision with so many different

61
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,650
channels,
streaming services and websites,

62
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,090
media has fragmented each appealing to 
their own individual audiences.

63
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,493
Fox News for conservatives,
MSNBC for liberals and Youtube for flat 

64
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:34,150
earthers get each of these media outlets
must pander to their audience,

65
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,390
which is why Fox News can't piss off 
mainstream republicans,

66
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:42,391
evangelicals and NRA members and Msnbc 
can't piss off mainstream Democrats,

67
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,830
progressives,
and gun control advocates.

68
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,530
The result is isolated bubbles that 
become harder and harder to burst.

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,710
It's like beatty said,
offended as few as possible.

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,660
The truth is secondary to comfort,
and once someone finds their bubble,

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,820
don't label anything that challenges 
their ideas

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,840
as fake news,
both in the book and in real life.

73
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,230
People protect themselves from anything 
that confounds or upsets.

74
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,700
They just want to continue watching and 
scrolling and watching and scrolling,

75
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,230
watching,
scrolling.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,233
So what happens next in Fahrenheit?
It's here that the government steps in 

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,450
encouraging everyone to stay in the 
bubble and torch any stragglers.

78
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,583
Sometimes literally,
are we destined for a similar fate or 

79
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,920
will the champions of free thought save 
assault?

80
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,860
Alright,
hope you guys enjoyed that.
