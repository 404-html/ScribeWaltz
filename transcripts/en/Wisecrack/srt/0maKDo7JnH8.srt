1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,043
Roy at the present time,
our senses are inadequate to do the 

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,270
things you mentioned.
However,

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,920
with the addition of technology,
it is very easy to imagine a time in the

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:18,300
future when we would have super senses.
For example,

5
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:21,720
our eyeball can only see red,
green and blue,

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,900
the primary colors,
but animals can see different colors.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,950
Bees,
for example,

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,784
can see ultra violet radiation.
That's how the law clumped in the sun 

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,043
when it's raining and it's cloudy,
you think that bees would starve to 

10
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:37,200
death because they don't know where the 
flower patches wrong.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,363
They log onto the sun and in under 
ultraviolet radiation bees can see the 

12
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,090
sun.
So for us,

13
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,010
however,
we can't see infrared,

14
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:49,200
we can't see ultraviolet.
However,

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,170
it is possible that one day we'll have 
contact lenses,

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,560
contact lenses with full internet 
capability.

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,483
So we will blink and we will be online 
and these contact lenses could be 

18
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,360
sensitive to infrared or ultraviolet 
radiation,

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,370
in which case we could see radiation 
that is invisible to us already.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,670
It's possible to get the x ray vision of
Superman.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,370
If you think of Superman comics,
you think,

22
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,410
no way.
You can't have x Ray Vision.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,380
You have half a photographic film behind
the person.

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,360
You would have to shine,
photograph,

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,560
shine,
x-rays,

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,650
develop the film to get the x Ray.
You're the person.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,160
You can't do that with an eyeball.
It turns out we can.

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,500
There's something called backscattered 
rays,

29
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,950
which gives you x Ray Vision.
Allah Superman,

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,570
almost indistinguishable from the x ray 
vision of superman comics.

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,583
Here's how you do it.
You Get a light bulb that emits x Ray 

32
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:48,211
radiation that floods the room,
the x rays bounce off the walls.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,980
Then you put on special goggles or 
lenses which are sensitive to x,

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,290
x rays.
Hit the wall,

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,483
go behind the person's back,
go through the person and into your 

36
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,550
goggles.
That's how you do it.

37
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:05,460
Without photographic film,
let's call back scattered x rays.

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,800
It already exists,
and in fact,

39
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,920
because of the nine 11 attack,
there's been a rush,

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,210
a rush to put backscattered x rays in 
airports at the present time.

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,373
In fact,
it's already causing civil liberties 

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,660
lawsuits because some people don't want 
their privacy invaded.

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,620
They don't want a superman to look at 
them with their x ray vision.

44
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,660
So,
and even telepathy,

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,643
we have certain forms of telepathy even 
today by putting Mri Scans and he eeg 

46
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:35,694
scans onto our brainwaves.
So we can actually appear now into the 

47
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:43,500
fabric of our own thoughts.
It's rather primitive.

48
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,240
However,
we have a dictionary,

49
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,420
a dictionary of objects like dogs,
cats,

50
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,610
houses,
and brain patterns.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,820
So by looking at a person's brain 
pattern through an Mri,

52
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,803
you can actually tell if the person is 
looking at a dog or a cat that exists 

53
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,630
today.
In the future,

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
our vocabulary of maybe 20 pictures may 
be increased to a few thousand.

55
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,263
And at that point,
that's beginning to look like real 

56
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:09,444
telepathy.
