1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,390
Yeah,
yeah.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,230
I mean,
the thing that troubles me the most,

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,840
they here in the country is it we become
so partisan.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,593
Uh,
I remember when I first joined the 

5
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,810
congress way back,
1980,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,580
uh,
there was a rule,

7
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,414
you know,
the partisanship stops at the water's 

8
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,131
edge.
That's blown,

9
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:25,990
that's gone.
Uh,

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,120
there,
there was a time in that,

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,920
in that history when I joined the 
congress,

12
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:30,754
when one party has such a commanding 
presence in the Congress or the other 

13
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,040
never even thought about gaining 
control.

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,163
Well,
I got along now they both realize they 

15
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,640
can control things if they just destroy 
each other sufficiently.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,540
I mean,
the,

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,750
the lesson of the Republican takeover of
the house was it,

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,041
uh,
you know,

19
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,874
if you could,
if you could tear down institutions so 

20
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,330
dramatically in the eyes of the American
public,

21
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:54,160
you can take it over.
Uh,

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,030
that's been repeated now,
uh,

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,610
in,
in the last election cycle.

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,600
And it will be repeated again if 
partisanship is,

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,040
is so important in this country that,
that,

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,290
that people are willing to,
you know,

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,980
to just attack each other rather than 
debate each other's ideas.

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,853
There was a,
there was a better tutorial I think in 

29
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,920
one of the news magazines going way 
back.

30
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:22,390
I remember I talked about the impact of 
television and negative campaigning upon

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,360
the politics of our country.
And um,

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,390
I made the case that,
you know,

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,273
television was such a powerful entity 
that if you combined it with negative 

34
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,374
campaigning and negative advertising,
you could wreck some pretty significant 

35
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:39,280
damage to our system.
I think that's happened.

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,830
Like they pointed out,
you know,

37
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,870
if Mcdonald's and Burger King had run 
ads for 10 years on television,

38
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,750
not talking about how good that product 
right,

39
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,360
but how awful the other guys' products 
were and I'm rotten and disease causing,

40
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,140
et Cetera.

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,300
We wouldn't be choosing among brands.
We would,

42
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,163
we would be the hamburgers anymore.
And the point that the article made was 

43
00:01:58,811 --> 00:01:59,940
that,
you know,

44
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,280
we're reaching a stage where we're not 
choosing between candidates anymore.

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,593
We're turning off on the whole system 
and Americans today a turning off 

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,660
dramatically on the two parties and the 
system,

47
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,003
uh,
the reputation of congress is an all 

48
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,870
time low presidencies.
Reputation is at an all time low,

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,980
uh,
driven in large part by a willingness to

50
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:25,450
attack each other rather than the debate
our ideas as civilized human beings.

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,913
And,
and,

52
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,950
and I think we face a real danger here 
in this country.

53
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:30,784
If it continues at some point,
respect for the institutions of our 

54
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,250
government,
uh,

55
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,203
either has to recover or this old time,
lower experiencing is going to pull it 

56
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,480
apart.
And,

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,320
and who knows what we get in its place?

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,201
Well,
I,

59
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,034
you know this,
there's an easy recipe and that is your 

60
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,050
recipe is to turn out anybody who plays 
negative politics and,

61
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,973
and start insisting that candidates 
speak positively about each other and 

62
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,180
about their ideas and debate the ideas.
And the,

63
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,600
the,
the national press could,

64
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,070
could help with that.
But obviously,

65
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,450
you know,
everybody likes a good fight.

66
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
So instead we like negative politics.
And as much as people say they don't 

67
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,930
like him and you check with the 
pollsters,

68
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,170
they work there,
they,

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,053
they literally help elect candidates.
If I can make you believe the other 

70
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,720
guy's worse than I am,
I get your vote.

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,390
Uh,
we gotta,

72
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,920
we gotta recognize it.
That ain't good for the country.

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,873
We've got to change that.
We've got to literally start rewarding 

74
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,830
positive politics in America.
Again,

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,960
we've got to start rewarding those who 
were willing to reach out across the,

76
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:37,794
the,
the middle of the chasm and work 

77
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,740
together that,
you know,

78
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,550
there are fewer and fewer people brave 
enough to do that in America.

79
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,530
We've got to start rewarding them when 
they do that.

80
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,573
We've got,
we've got to say to the Joe Lieberman 

81
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,944
is,
we're not going to penalize you because 

82
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,340
you're reached across the aisle and work
with,

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,233
with Republicans on something that was 
important or to say the conservative 

84
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,374
Democrats that you're going to get 
penalized because you worked with 

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,620
Republican Party Republicans who reach 
across the aisle and work with Democrats

86
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,880
on a health care issue.
Whatever it is,

87
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,980
we've got to start saying,
that's okay.

88
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:09,850
That's not only,
okay,

89
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,300
that's good and we can't let the parties
run the show.
