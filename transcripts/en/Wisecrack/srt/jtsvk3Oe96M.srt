had to wix.com/wise
crack.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,283
Hey guys,
Michael here are some known in the 

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:12,354
office,
the bad boy of 19th century Danish 

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,904
philosophy scholarship.
You probably already know two of the 

6
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:17,514
things we love rambling about most it 
wisecrack are superheroes and 

7
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,084
philosophy.
So today we're going to take a look at 

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,270
two films that are full of superheroes 
and big philosophical questions.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,930
The incredibles and incredibles.
Two since the release of the incredibles

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,764
films,
there has been much digital ink spill 

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,600
over its philosophical themes with much 
of it pulling around.

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,810
One idea,
namely that the incredibles is making an

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,673
argument for objectivism,
a philosophical theory developed by 

14
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,424
novelists.
I N rant advocates for this reading 

15
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,154
point to the emphasis on the 
exceptionalism of the supers and the 

16
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,424
implied critique of Egalitarian Society 
has evidence and while we see where 

17
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,320
they're coming from,
if the time comes,

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,560
you'll know what to do,
it's in your blood.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,633
We also think they're wrong.
While there is undoubtedly some 

20
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,310
objective is colored to the films.
They're true philosophical importance is

21
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,144
the way in which they consider the 
question of power from the moral 

22
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,504
responsibility of having superpowers to 
fans going insane due to a desire for 

23
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,170
power to the power and influence of the 
media.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,333
These films posed questions that are as 
pertinent now as they were in 2004 and 

25
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,250
this time we agree with you.
Kanye,

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,270
welcome to this wisecrack addition on 
the philosophy of the incredibles and of

27
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,030
course spoilers ahead.
But before we get to that,

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,680
uh,

radioactive web designer anymore.

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,320
More in that at the end of the video.
And now back to the fantastic four,

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,630
I mean the incredibles.
First.

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,210
A quick recap in the first movie,
Mr.

40
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:09,480
Incredible scorned.
Former fan buddy wants to be a soup,

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,610
but since he's a normie he decides to 
use technology to kill them all.

42
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,710
Instead taking on the villainous 
persona.

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,583
I am here buddy plans to use Mr 
incredible to optimize his own personal 

44
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:24,150
death machine.
The Omni drove once perfected.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,073
He plans to defeat it in public so that 
society will see him as a hero and 

46
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,484
eventually he can sell his technology as
a product so that everyone can become 

47
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,380
super.
And as we all know,

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,830
everyone super,
no one will be Mr.

49
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,324
Incredible fuels,
neutered and aimless as a result of the 

50
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,550
superhero relocation program.
But what are you waiting for?

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,193
Yeah,

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,020
I mean two kid and secretly returns to 
the superhero game to curb and impending

53
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:58,924
midlife crisis.
He even questions the point of the 

54
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,250
egalitarian spirit of dashes elementary 
school.

55
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,084
It's not a graduation is moving from the
fourth grade to the fifth grade 

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
ceremony.
It's psychotic.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,350
They keep creating new ways to celebrate
mediocrity.

58
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,560
But if someone is genuinely exceptional,
then you bob.

59
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,423
But he eventually comes full circle as 
he realizes that his power isn't just 

60
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,834
for feeling like a bad ass.
But instead makes him responsible for 

61
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,300
the good of society.
In this parable about power,

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,343
we see that great power unchecked by 
great responsibility leads to very bad 

63
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,174
things.
Incredibles two continues this 

64
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,100
exploration of power,
but shifts the focus to the considerable

65
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:40,660
influence of two media moguls,
prestige,

66
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,050
a no,
not those media moguls.

67
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,650
These ones,
the brother Winston devore is a lifelong

68
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,484
superhero fan who wants to use his media
influence and his seemingly endless 

69
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:52,924
piles of money to repair the supers,
broken public image and change the laws 

70
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,490
so that they are legal again,
while his sister Evelyn wants to use set

71
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,150
it influenced to mind control supers 
into doing horrible things,

72
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,103
thus ruining their public image and 
ensuring that people don't put faith in 

73
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,830
them ever again.

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,023
All right,
so in order to discern why the film has 

75
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,660
been read through the lens of 
Objectivism,

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,673
we need to first figure out what in the 
hell is objective isn't the basic 

77
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,500
tenants of Randy and objectivism are 
one.

78
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,603
The ability of human reason to gain 
objective knowledge of reality to the 

79
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,320
moral aim of human life is to seek 
personal happiness.

80
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,650
Three man's being is heroic in nature 
and for that free market,

81
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,184
deregulated capitalism is the socio 
economic system most suitable for this 

82
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,894
happy heroism.
So basically the philosophy of Ron 

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,580
Swanson,
this man is a failure.

84
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,623
He is not up to snuff.
His business was failing and you're 

85
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,000
bailing it out.
This is a bailout and I don't like it.

86
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,863
We might usually associate heroism with 
those who use their powers to help 

87
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,070
others,
but for rand,

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,850
a captain of industry is a better 
example as they're the ones who make the

89
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,990
world better simply by willing their own
power and proving their superiority.

90
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,973
Randy and super heroes don't wear capes 
but rather neatly press suits with 

91
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:12,280
Italian shoes and gold plated cufflinks.
Now,

92
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,293
according to a whole bunch of writers,
this is just the sort of philosophy we 

93
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,284
find in the incredibles.
Normal Society represents the 

94
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,464
meaningless egalitarianism,
which tells us that everyone is special 

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,913
and that it's bad to be exceptional.
The supers represent randy and heroes 

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,490
frustrated by society's obsession with 
fairness and equality.

97
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,190
Only when they are able to don their 
mask and tights.

98
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,083
Are they able to will their own power 
and find happiness in their own 

99
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,354
strength.
But rather than advocating for 

100
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:39,694
objectivism,
these films shine a light on the types 

101
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,040
of problems that come from this 
inherently selfish philosophy.

102
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,800
Through the failures of both [inaudible]
and Evelyn,

103
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,873
they explore a number of interesting 
philosophical ideas and relationship to 

104
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,790
power and responsibility.
If anything,

105
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,210
the films may be an exploration of what 
happens when keeping it rand goes wrong.

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,390
So let's start by taking a look at the 
first film.

107
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,493
As we mentioned,
many of the incredibles as objectivist 

108
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
proponent's point to the characters 
frustrations with the inhibition of 

109
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,010
their exceptional nature.
Bob Can't use his powers to stop muggins

110
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,220
and instead professionally ruined the 
lives of old ladies.

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,353
Then there's dash who can't try out for 
sports less t go all USAIN bolt on his 

112
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,930
classmates

113
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,410
generally set her powers are nothing to 
be shutting down.

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,070
Our parents made us special.
Everyone is special dash,

115
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,320
which is another way of saying no.
Yes.

116
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,273
And while we see how examples of 
people's exceptional nature being 

117
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,560
suppressed by society can be read as 
objectivist,

118
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,830
it ignores some clues to the contrary.
First of all,

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,940
the insurance companies sucks,
and Mr Incredibles boss is a monster who

120
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,210
only cares about profit.
Tell me how you're keeping ensure a care

121
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,310
in the black.
Help me how that's possible,

122
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,400
but you were writing checks for every 
Harry hard luck and Sally Tom Story that

123
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:55,250
gives you a phone call.
This of course,

124
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,980
makes him an ideal candidate for a randy
and hero,

125
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,843
but there's no evidence that he's 
anywhere close to a sympathetic 

126
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:03,200
character.
I'm that happy Bob,

127
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,710
not happy.
Most importantly,

128
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,930
this reading ignores Bob's moral 
journey,

129
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,710
which can be best understood with the 
help of the Greek philosopher aristotle,

130
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,573
who's super power was getting millions 
of undergrads to read his boring books 

131
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,474
for thousands of years.
When bob first shoves his middle aged 

132
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,880
body back into a suit and gets back into
the game,

133
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,773
he does indeed exemplify the type of 
selfish exceptionalism that rand lauded 

134
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:28,574
as heroic.

135
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,413
He starts to care more about his secret 
superhero missions than he does his own 

136
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,390
family.
Selfishly prioritizing his own power and

137
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,224
the pleasure it brings.
So if you stop the movie after half an 

138
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,280
hour,
then shore.

139
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,113
Mr Incredible is an objectivist and the 
whole movie is one big o to iron rand's 

140
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:45,494
philosophy,
but for those of us who finish the 

141
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:47,804
movie,
we see that Mr incredible is simply 

142
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,114
beginning of moral journey in which he 
learns about the true purpose of having 

143
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,700
great power.
In his lectures on ethics,

144
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,510
aristotle tells us what it means to live
a moral and happy life,

145
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,433
but before giving us the answers,
he warns us of some of the common 

146
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,300
temptations that keep us from true 
happiness,

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,430
namely pleasure,
money,

148
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,440
and power.
Coincidentally,

149
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,800
all of these are essential components of
objective is happiness.

150
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,783
Much like trying to understand bitcoin.
Aristotle thinks our moral journey 

151
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,780
should consist of an endless pursuit 
without a steaming end.

152
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,350
After all pleasurable activities 
eventually get boring.

153
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,590
Money is only for other stuff and never 
really makes us happy.

154
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,460
And power is often dependent on factors 
outside our control.

155
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,563
Mr Incredible seems to fall into a 
devil's threeway of moral temptation as 

156
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,350
is super secret superhero activities.
Bring him pleasure,

157
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,243
make him feel powerful and throw some 
extra o's in his bank account along the 

158
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,174
way,
like a good randy in hero in this false 

159
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:46,964
happiness.
He's experiencing pleasure from his own 

160
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,330
power,
which is sort of like masturbating you a

161
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,600
picture of yourself and according to a a
friend of mine,

162
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,440
you can't come back from that.

163
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,533
Now of course,
Mr incredible is only drawn back into 

164
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:05,031
his super self via the trickery of his 
old fan buddy now acting as syndrome and

165
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:05,904
while buddy wanted nothing more than to 
be mister incredibles faithful sidekick 

166
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,534
when he was younger,
this fixation on power has turned his 

167
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,180
fandom and a near psychotic obsession 
after all,

168
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,913
I am your biggest fan buddy has 
structured his happiness and his moral 

169
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,810
goals around this pursuit of power.
He wants power so badly that it needs to

170
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,644
destroy the supers to prove to himself 
and the world that he has an ultimate 

171
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,844
source of power and this does not end 
well as at one point buddy doesn't seem 

172
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:37,560
to give a crap when Mr incredible almost
kills his assistant Mirage.

173
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,290
That sounds a little dark for you.
Now go ahead.

174
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,810
If she was an objectivist before this 
encounter,

175
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,630
she's throwing out her copy of atlas 
shrugged afterwards.

176
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,853
On the flip side,
when Mr Incredibles pursuit of personal 

177
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:53,640
power puts his family in harm's way,
he realizes that his power is only moral

178
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,550
when it's actively used in the service 
of others.

179
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm not strong.
I'm strong enough and this will make you

180
00:09:58,801 --> 00:09:59,670
strong.
Goodness.

181
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,000
No,
it's what they see is some sort of work.

182
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,690
Alec camp use you again,

183
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,730
whether these others be as family or the
innocent citizens of Metro Hill.

184
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,040
This stands in stark contrast with 
rands.

185
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,550
Insistence that one's personal happiness
leads to the greatest good,

186
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,593
I swear by my life and my love of it,
but I will never live for the sake of 

187
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:21,404
whatever law nor ask another to live,
and it's this that distinguishes buddy 

188
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,420
from Mr.
Incredible.

189
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,583
An incredible too.
It seems as if a couple of objectivist 

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,310
captains of industry might just be the 
saviors of supers everywhere.

191
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,443
As the second film finds the incredibles
both broke and without government 

192
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:39,524
protection.
These two hyper capitalist Winston and 

193
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:42,824
Evelyn Endeavor are set to make 
everything better with their financial 

194
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:48,410
resources and media influence.
For a moment,

195
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,890
it seems that the powers of industry 
might just save the day.

196
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,843
And Randy,
in terms the devore siblings are titans 

197
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:56,870
of industry ready to get what they want.

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,793
I.
E fulfill their own happiness via the 

199
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,374
most powerful force in modern society.
The media as a childhood superhero nerd 

200
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,700
all grown up.
Winston wants to use his media influence

201
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,300
to literally change the law so that he 
can get what he wants,

202
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,600
which is a world full of cool 
superheroes to idolize.

203
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,350
And though Evelyn might initially seem 
on board with their brothers plans,

204
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,453
she intends to use her tech empire to 
make sure that supers go extinct as she 

205
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:26,750
has spent her entire life blaming them 
for the loss of her father.

206
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,110
It's revealed in the film that when 
burglars broke into their home,

207
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,560
Evelyn and Winston's father waited on 
two supers to save him,

208
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,370
but they never showed up and he was 
murdered for Evelyn.

209
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,293
Her father's reliance on the supers is 
indicative of an inability to take 

210
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,420
responsibility for one's own life and 
actions.

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,433
It's sort of like how all of us who grew
up with spellcheck can't spell calendar 

212
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,900
or definitely to save our lives.

213
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,250
Evelyn's desire for self reliance is 
very random,

214
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,780
but it's not so kosher that she wants to
stifle the exceptionalism of others.

215
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,883
But while all of these shiny titans of 
industry are spending billions to get 

216
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:03,634
what they want,
the villain screen slaver exposes the 

217
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:09,790
dark power of screens.
This resentment of superheroes and their

218
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:14,791
broader effect on society leads Evelyn 
to create screen slaver whose mission is

219
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:17,470
expressed in a strikingly poignant 
manifesto.

220
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,513
Superheroes are part of your brain lists
desired or replace true experience with 

221
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:25,030
simulation.
You don't talk,

222
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:30,031
you watch talk shows to watch shows,
travel relationships,

223
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:37,390
risks,
every meaningful experience packaged and

224
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,663
to watch it at a distance.
If much of this sounds eerily true of 

225
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,410
our contemporary relationship to 
technology,

226
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,363
it's because it is.
Before we know that Evelyn is screen 

227
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,560
slaver.
She has a conversation about the ills of

228
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,470
the modern era with Helen in which Helen
agrees with her.

229
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,423
Which of us has the greater influence 
which side of Mary you asking the 

230
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:57,784
believer or the cynic cynic would say 
selling is more important because the 

231
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,720
best sellers have the most buyers.
It doesn't matter what you're selling.

232
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,300
It only matters what people buy.
Now,

233
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,134
while I disciple of rand might argue 
that our present digital age has led to 

234
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,184
a capitalist utopia in which the right 
algorithms can lead to massive wealth 

235
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,330
for the exceptional few.
The Moody's explore the effect that this

236
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,210
entertainment driven media has on our 
humanity.

237
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,253
To better understand this,
we can turn to 19th century Danish 

238
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,434
philosopher Soren Kierkegaard,
who at times was the screen slaver of 

239
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,304
his day.
Kierkegaard was worried that the modern 

240
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:32,914
media,
which at that point was the dawn of 

241
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:34,864
print media,
was creating a world devoid of passion 

242
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,343
in which reading about the interesting 
lives of others was thought to be 

243
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,730
equivalent to living an interesting 
life,

244
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,040
oneself and align.

245
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,873
That makes me relatively convinced that 
he had access to time travel and spent 

246
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,410
an afternoon reading sponsored content 
on instagram.

247
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,383
Kierkegaard said about his own age that 
while they revolutionary age is an age 

248
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,534
of action,
the present age is an age of 

249
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,460
advertisement and publicity.
Nothing happens,

250
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,503
but there is instantly publicity about 
it for both screen slaver and 

251
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:05,764
Kierkegaard,
the media distorts our relationship to 

252
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:08,584
powerful people as rather than lead us 
to imitating them in our own lives and 

253
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,070
activities,
we settle and become mere spectators.

254
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,963
Kierkegaard was worried that this would 
make 19th century Europe devoid of 

255
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,580
passion and individuality.
Of course,

256
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,414
this doesn't end well for Evelyn and 
eventually the superheroes all come 

257
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:28,150
together and use their collective power 
for good.

258
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,163
Both stopping Evelyn's plan and in the 
process restoring the world's faith in 

259
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,534
the goodness of superheroes.
Notably Winston is pushed to action 

260
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,344
during the final act,
not just using his massive resources to 

261
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:41,644
change the world for the better,
but by actually risking his own life to 

262
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,940
save the lives of others.

263
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,953
Just like in the first film,
we see that true heroics isn't just 

264
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,034
flexing one's power.
It's about doing the right thing at the 

265
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,040
right time.
A pull.

266
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:55,874
One more example from aristotle.
He thought that justice was completed 

267
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,570
virtue as true justice is working for 
the good of another.

268
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,470
And in this way,
both films show that True Heroes Exhibit

269
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,423
this type of justice as their power is 
at its most virtuous when it's used in 

270
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:11,834
service of others.
And we have a final critique of randy 

271
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,450
and thought in violence.
Final words during Evelyn's arrest.

272
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,321
Well,
I'm sorry,

273
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:21,680
she's rich and we'll probably get no 
more than a slap on the wrist because at

274
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,740
the end of the day,
Metro Ville is like our own world.

275
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,920
And access to wealth is the ultimate 
superpower.

276
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,370
And while Randy and objectivist would 
enthusiastically agreed,

277
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,240
violet is pointing out the fundamental 
injustice in this type of system.

278
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,343
So there you have it.
What some see as a pair of films at the 

279
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,770
Randy and slams are in fact asking 
crucial questions about power,

280
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,843
responsibility,
and the forces in our world that have 

281
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:47,930
power over our attention and 
imagination.

282
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,620
And just in case you still need to hold 
onto some sort of objective truth.

283
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,070
Just listen to what Mr incredible has to
say about math.

284
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,910
Why would they change math?
Math is math is math.

285
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,803
Or if not,
