00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,030
This video is brought to you by Wix,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,700
a wise crack.
Jared here,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,993
Jack is back.
That means it's time to saddle up and 

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:14,200
head back to the strange and depressing 
world of Hollywood.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,393
Now we've already talked about Frodo 
narrative and distraction in previous 

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:18,934
videos,
but this season really dives deep into 

7
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:22,990
an idea that's always been present in 
the show,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,170
that idea loneliness,
who's comfortable with it,

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,183
who's uncomfortable with it,
and who takes 100 painkillers a day to 

10
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:34,300
avoid it at all costs through its 
ensemble of dysfunctional relationships.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,740
Bojack gives us a fresh and quite 
nuanced perspective on loneliness,

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,603
not often seen on TV.
Can loneliness be healthy or even 

13
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,470
necessary?
Well,

14
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,304
let's find out in this wisecrack quick 
take on bojack horseman season five and 

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,860
of course spoilers ahead,
but real quick,

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,000
a shadow tour,
new channels sponsor wicks.

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,123
We're building a new website using wix 
that we'll have a bunch of fun and 

18
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:56,974
interactive features,
including a way for you to vote on what 

19
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,340
we should cover in an upcoming episode.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,890
So more on that at the end of the video,
but for now,

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,170
back to bojack.
So first guys,

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,033
a quick recap.
This season revolves around the 

23
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,150
production of bojack's new TV show,
Filbert,

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,780
where bojack navigates a semi 
relationship with his Costar,

25
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:14,950
Gina.
Meanwhile,

26
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,900
Princess Carolyn attempts to adopt a 
baby.

27
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,350
Todd manages his career as a VP at what 
time is it right now,

28
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,184
dot com and Mr.
peanut butter and Diane finalized their 

29
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:27,700
divorce in an attempt to move on with 
their lives as early as the first line.

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,880
Willingness is established as a central 
theme of the season.

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,210
Nothing lonelier than a party.
Good thing.

32
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,840
I don't need anyone or I might feel 
lonesome and as we'll see,

33
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,900
every major character struggles with 
this in their own way.

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,600
Let's start with the most obvious one.
Diane,

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,583
who is struggling to reconcile her 
identity as a newly divorced single 

36
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:47,794
woman.
We've seen in previous seasons how hard 

37
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,930
she used to try to keep up with Mr.
peanut butter's expectation speed.

38
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,990
A fun party goer like him having to find
herself in relation to him for so long,

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,313
only made her focus on her supposedly 
shortcomings as an introvert while 

40
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,410
abandoning other aspects of herself that
she actually liked.

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,393
This is all the stuff that cool,
20 something Diane had to put away when 

42
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:10,450
she moved in with old man peanut butter.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,433
In episode two,
we follow her non sequentially across a 

44
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,280
timeline that starts with her hitting on
bojack.

45
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,070
You could totally make out right now

46
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,993
during a moment of lonely desperation.
Then after finding out that Mr peanut 

47
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:24,330
butter has a new girlfriend,
she flees to Vietnam for a solo trip.

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,770
Once there she's rendered doubly alone 
by her inability to speak Vietnamese and

49
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,680
her fellow Americans assumptions that 
she doesn't speak English.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,450
You Viet Nam.

51
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,620
No me,
America.

52
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,120
She copes with her loneliness in various
ways.

53
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,103
At one point,
engaging in a mega brief romance with a 

54
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,104
grip,
but every interaction puts Diane Moore 

55
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,260
Ilities from a conversation with todd 
about something.

56
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,450
I'm supposed to go to the roller rink 
later.

57
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,810
Hopefully there won't be any mob bosses 
there.

58
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,510
What am I saying?
That's so random to the grips.

59
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,344
Endless pontification.
Diane realizes often interacting with 

60
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,640
the outside world only leaves her 
feeling more alone.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,820
She eventually comes to terms with her 
romantic aloneness,

62
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,893
apologizing to bojack for her mixed 
messages and admitting that I just 

63
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,030
really need a friend right now over the 
course of the season,

64
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,864
she seems increasingly self actualized 
from being able to comfort her romantic 

65
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:21,220
semi rival pickles to performing a solo 
intervention for bojack.

66
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,413
Now more on that later,
generally she's able to exist more 

67
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,444
truthfully now that she's not dating 
someone who doesn't align with our 

68
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:30,280
values.
Even her therapist admits that

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,340
sounds like our time together is done.
What fact that you're setting a boundary

70
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,183
is good.
Go forth with the tools that I've given 

71
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:38,170
you

72
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,003
through Diane.
We see that self sufficiency and 

73
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:44,380
embracing solitude can be key to 
realizing the truest,

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,020
strongest version of yourself.
Now,

75
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:47,854
while Diane is able to be happily alone,
other characters attempt to make 

76
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,590
relationships work in order to avoid 
confronting loneliness.

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,633
Just as Diane's relationship with Mr.
peanut butter makes her obsess over her 

78
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,610
fun quotient.
Todd's relationship seemed to only bring

79
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,920
out his two shortcomings.
First,

80
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,754
in his relationship with Yolanda,
todd is hurt by the hyperfocused on his 

81
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,820
lack of life direction.
Why did you tell her

82
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,350
family?
I went to college.

83
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,470
Um,
I dunno.

84
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,500
I guess I just wanted you to seem 
impressive.

85
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,040
Ultimately he decides to end the 
relationship.

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,500
Yolanda,
we need to break up.

87
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,423
Second.
He's so eager to make things work with 

88
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:21,794
emily that he constructs a sex robot,
which he is convinced could compensate 

89
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:26,384
for his disinterest in sex.
While emily isn't super into boning the 

90
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:30,194
sex robot,
the big wigs at what time is it right 

91
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:32,474
now.
Dot Com are impressed by its Moxie and 

92
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:35,414
the robot is ultimately promoted to CEO.
Todd ultimately destroys the sexual 

93
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:43,130
robot and takes off his executive suit,
thereby eliminating the parts of himself

94
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:45,560
that we're trying to please Yolanda and 
emily.

95
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,270
As with Diane Todd's interactions.
Show how some romantic relationships can

96
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:51,104
leave you feeling more alone and more.
And now for Princess Carolyn in episode 

97
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:56,594
five,
we get some deeper insights into her 

98
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,544
past learning how she went from being 
the helps knocked up daughter at the 

99
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,084
mercy of her boyfriend's answering 
machine tape dynasty only to miscarry 

100
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:09,410
and find herself on her own instead of 
mourning the life she lost.

101
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,423
She created an entirely new one for 
herself by moving to La and clawing her 

102
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:14,984
way up the Hollywood ladder.
It's worth noting that her latest 

103
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:21,230
journey and selfsufficiency also came 
after a miscarriage,

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,720
the one that blew up her relationship 
with Milton.

105
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,990
Once again,
we see Princess Carolyn land on her feet

106
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,883
and channel the same bravery as her 
teenage self and starting over after a 

107
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:36,320
difficult loss while sitting in the 
hospital waiting to meet her maybe baby.

108
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,363
She admits to Milton that fourth season,
Princess Carolyn did want him to stick 

109
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,720
around the night.
She kicked him out.

110
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,970
I wish you'd stayed with me that night.
Do you told me to leave?

111
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,970
I guess the lesson is don't listen to 
me.

112
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:48,804
Right.

113
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,993
However,
later she clearly tells him to leave 

114
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,590
saying that she doesn't want to raise 
the baby with him,

115
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,470
and this time she means it.
She's what?

116
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,730
She wants.
Self sufficiency.

117
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,910
For instance,
Carolyn's joke about her baby's name,

118
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,710
untitled Princess Carolyn project,
so just that as with her previous career

119
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,544
successes,
Princess Carolyn will manage single 

120
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,210
motherhood just fine.
All right,

121
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
so Diane Todd and Princess Carolyn's 
journeys through season five illustrate 

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,340
various takes on that double edge sword 
of loneliness and self sufficiency,

123
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,230
which brings us to Mr.
peanut butter,

124
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,363
Mr.
peanut butter also fits this narrative 

125
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,510
because as the character most in need of
company,

126
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,590
he's also the least inclined to self 
reflections.

127
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,270
No,
I'm not tough enough.

128
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll show them how tough I can be.

129
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,730
We'll be back with more of the red 
carpet pre show fashion stravaganza.

130
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,200
Unlike the other characters,
Mr.

131
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,460
peanut butter rarely appears to want 
anything beyond fame,

132
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,303
fun and parties.
He seems physically incapable of being 

133
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,594
alone,
getting with the first half his age dog 

134
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,720
lady he meets after signing his divorce 
papers as a serial monogamist.

135
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,880
He made desperately hide from loneliness
or self reflection,

136
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,760
seeking solace in relationships the same
way he seek solace in loud parties.

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,740
In the Halloween episode,
Mr.

138
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,663
peanut butter gets dangerously close to 
introspection as he wonders how each of 

139
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,420
his wives became bitter and unhappy by 
the end of their relationship.

140
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,750
What's the common denominator?
Diane offers some insights.

141
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,810
You keep dating women in their twenties.
I do do that are not fully formed yet.

142
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,150
Life changes.
People know about me.

143
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,970
The women he marries eventually grow up 
while Mr.

144
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,050
peanut butter remains the same.
It seems that in constantly dating women

145
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,340
who are younger than him,
Mr.

146
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,263
peanut butter has carved out a 
convenient emotional niche he can 

147
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:41,170
continue to occupy as he replaces each 
consecutive life with a younger,

148
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,123
more fun version.
This safe paint by numbers approach to 

149
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:45,634
marriage has kept Mr.
peanut butter happy but prevented him 

150
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:50,830
from maturing in any meaningful way.
Ultimately,

151
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,664
Mr peanut butter reveals himself to be 
truly pathological in his need to be 

152
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,204
coupled up when instead of telling 
pickles the truth about his infidelity 

153
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:58,864
and risking losing her,
he decides to put a radio and finally 

154
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:05,500
our boy bojack.
While Mr peanut butter may be needy,

155
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,440
at least he's totally upfront about 
bojack.

156
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,274
On the other hand,
it has a more complex and more painful 

157
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,514
relationship to the outside world from 
Holly Holly Hawk in the middle of the 

158
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:17,500
night to inform her that he liked her on
instagram.

159
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,930
Let you know that I started your 
instagram photo

160
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,160
to pretending to match Gina's blahzay.
Take on the relationship.

161
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,900
We work together,
we make six together.

162
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:29,290
We don't talk about her feelings and yet
sometimes I've been grudging respect can

163
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,124
blossom into blossoms,
into nothing is when I was going to say 

164
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:35,560
you go bojack's need for human slash 
animal.

165
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,530
Companionship is palpable.
Pojoaque has gone the Mr.

166
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,040
peanut butter route in the past,
getting with women to avoid solitude,

167
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,090
a a toxic pattern that peaked with the 
nears seduction of his ex girlfriends,

168
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:46,924
teenage daughter.
This season piece kind of dating these 

169
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,890
supremely Jaden,
Gina,

170
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,770
who doesn't appear to need anything from
him emotionally.

171
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,120
I love

172
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,770
being alone.
I wish were alone right now,

173
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,650
leaving him

174
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,120
just as lonely as before so he decides 
to bypass the whole learning to be alone

175
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,850
with your thoughts thing by altering his
state of being,

176
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,893
enter painkillers writer Johann Hari 
makes a compelling case for considering 

177
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,350
drug addiction.
As a disease of bonding.

178
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,423
Humans have an innate primal need to 
bond and when they're unable to bond 

179
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,114
with other people,
they'll bond with a negative behavior 

180
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:20,350
like smoking or gambling.
Essentially,

181
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,184
he argues that substance use is a 
substitute for meaningful human 

182
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:24,784
connection,
and while researchers are also studying 

183
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,730
how other social and economic factors 
can influence addiction in the fictional

184
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:34,050
world of bojack,
loneliness seems like a closely,

185
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,243
Oh,
Jack Find Solace and drugs even as the 

186
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:37,564
embed him deeper into a fantasy world,
increasingly cutting him off from the 

187
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:41,674
people around him.
He begins to see friends and loved ones 

188
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,584
as tools for getting what he wants.
Gina is a tool for helping him sees the 

189
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,003
limelight,
and Hollyhock is a tool for helping him 

190
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,290
steal his pills back from Gina's 
medicine cabinet.

191
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,160
Our sense of Bojack's loneliness is 
augmented by the Filbert TV show.

192
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:57,994
Narrative.
Gilbert is a hard boiled loaner 

193
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:02,830
detective with a penchant for secrets 
and grizzly voiceover.

194
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,610
Why do you still use a landline?

195
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,520
What am I supposed to tell her?
I'm just an old fashioned guy,

196
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,880
or maybe I like things that are plugged 
to the wall.

197
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,783
Something to grab onto.
If I start floating away from the 

198
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:16,040
opening lines of the series,
bojack tries to imply that he relates to

199
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,800
the character as a fellow loaner slash 
Sinek.

200
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,160
This develops into an ongoing joke about
the similarities between the two.

201
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,500
The set of the show looks exactly like 
bojack's house and boat,

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,430
constantly wearing his silver costume 
offset.

203
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,950
It's a costume I.
I just finished filming a show.

204
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,813
Normally people return the costume.
Also bojack frequently reach too deeply 

205
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:39,460
into his characters narrative despite 
reminders that it's not about you,

206
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,170
you know,
Filbert.

207
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,760
By the end,
he's become so dissociated,

208
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,010
he's completely lost himself in the 
character,

209
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,233
even the character filbert loses track 
of where he begins and ends inventing a 

210
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:53,960
make believe partner who he blamed for 
his wife's murder.

211
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,120
Rather than taking responsibility for 
it,

212
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,420
there's no record of you ever having a 
partner at all.

213
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,890
You say you killed your wife and the 
chief and the coroner and the others.

214
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,503
Similarly,
bojack loses any distinction between 

215
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:12,690
himself and Filbert also because he 
can't cope with the horrible things he's

216
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:16,020
done.
The result of this disassociation bojack

217
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,440
pretty much retreats into a fantasy 
world where he does crazy like choke.

218
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:21,780
Gina.
At one point,

219
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,614
he comes face to face with the bloated 
balloon version of himself as if to 

220
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,424
illustrate the fact that his inability 
to face himself is ultimately to blame 

221
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,164
for all of his problems.
In an interesting moment in the season 

222
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:34,524
finale,
bojack begs diane to write one of her 

223
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,254
Internet takedowns of him.
He wants everyone to know about his 

224
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,150
worst behavior.
He wants to be despised,

225
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,590
chastise,
and punished.

226
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,573
Here bojack craves the feeling of being 
held accountable by the world for the 

227
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:52,581
same exact reason he craves it's company
praise and romantic attention because he

228
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:53,974
has no consistent sense of self.
He needs the world to reconcile his 

229
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,474
persona as lovable Hollywood,
leading man and narcissistic creep 

230
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,700
because he can't seem to do it on his 
own.

231
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,060
A soap actualized,
Diane is no longer interested in playing

232
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:11,770
bojack's games and diagnosis is request 
for what it is self serving.

233
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,510
Eventually,
Diane convinces him,

234
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,570
but the only person whose job it is to 
hold him accountable.

235
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,110
He is himself.
I am asking to be held accountable

236
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,990
and I'm telling you,
it's not going to happen.

237
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,280
Whatever you put in that story,
no one is going to hold you accountable.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,260
You need to take responsibility for 
yourself

239
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,490
and faster than UPC.
Narcotics anonymous.

240
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,473
She's persuaded him to go to Rehab,
so what are we to take from bojack 

241
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,180
season five?
It cannot rely on other people.

242
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,140
Bojack,
well,

243
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,420
not quite.
Oh,

244
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,100
Jack and his dad's certainly know how to
put a pessimistic spin,

245
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:45,010
our relationships,
but we shouldn't buy into their bleakest

246
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:45,844
insights.
While we can't hide ourselves in the 

247
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,214
company of others,
we have options beyond live and die 

248
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:53,260
alone.
While romantic relationships may fail or

249
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,094
prove toxic,
it's the platonic friendships that 

250
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:56,824
radiate through season five,
whether it's the budding roommate hood 

251
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,244
between todd and Princess Carolyn,
or the lasting bond between Diane and 

252
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,024
bojack.
They may have their ups and downs and 

253
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,460
stolen cheese sticks,
but they prove uniquely enduring.

254
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,460
Bojack starts the season claiming he 
doesn't need anyone,

255
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,413
but he ends up knowing there's one 
person who you can count on his friend 

256
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,433
Diane.

257
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,020
So what do you guys think?
Are we all alone in the world?

258
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,033
Our romantic relationships elaborate 
traps for making us feel bad about 

259
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:27,400
ourselves and is there power in being 
able to tolerate loneliness.

260
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,040
Let us know what you think the comments
