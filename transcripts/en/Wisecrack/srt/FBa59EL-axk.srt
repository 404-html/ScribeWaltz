What's up wisecrack jared?
Again,

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,730
if you guys haven't seen the torrent of 
tweets,

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,840
Netflix,
new show,

6
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,660
the haunting of hill house is getting 
some serious notoriety.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,710
It's got a 93% fresh rating on rotten 
tomatoes and some people are saying it's

8
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:27,860
so scary,
they're puking their guts out seriously,

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,580
which brings us to the question in a 
genre as bloated as horror.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
What makes another story about a haunted
house stand out?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,833
While we could point to the casting 
camera work or one of the best jump 

12
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:42,980
scares I've seen,
we actually think it has to do with wait

13
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:44,570
for it.
Ghosts.

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,190
All right,
I know,

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,023
but what makes hillhouse rise above 
shows like American horror story is a 

16
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,320
duality of the ghost metaphor that is 
incredibly smart.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,423
So grab those adult diapers and join me 
for this wisecrack quick take on the 

18
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:58,814
haunting of Hill House and yes was head.
But before we get into it and want to 

19
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:04,790
give a shout out to our sponsor over at 
epic games,

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,800
they're the creators of this really 
addicting game.

21
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,970
You may have heard of called fortnite 
hop on a battle bus and had to an island

22
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:11,804
for the ultimate battle l'oreal.
I actually recently downloaded on my 

23
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,850
phone and I'm digging it so to download 
the game for free,

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,853
head to the link in the description and 
stick around till the end of the video 

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,550
to hear more.
All right guys.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,970
First a quick recap.
The show follows the cranes during their

27
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,570
stay at the haunted hill house in the 
1980s while the parents,

28
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,760
Olivia and hugh are trying to flip the 
home.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,793
Mother and I,
we have to finish fixing this house and 

30
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,630
then someone has to buy it 50 years 
before it was trendy.

31
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,523
The kids spend the summer being 
irreparably traumatized by a series of 

32
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:44,050
terrifying events.
This all comes to an end though.

33
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,480
When the father rushes the kids out of 
the house one night.

34
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,230
What the show portrays is some spooky 
hunting business from the perspective of

35
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:53,200
the children is eventually revealed to 
be the suicide of the mother.

36
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,183
Flash forward to the presence and all 
the children are still living under the 

37
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,600
shadow of their past.
Steve,

38
00:01:58,601 --> 00:01:59,434
the oldest is a successful,
albeit cynical author writing about his 

39
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,664
paranormal childhood.
Shirley is a tightly wound type A 

40
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:07,054
mortician.
Vo is a clinical psychologist with some 

41
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:09,904
serious intimacy issues.
Luke is a junkie 90 days clean and his 

42
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:14,164
twin sister now,
well now's dead and it's her death that 

43
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:18,244
starts off a fresh batch of hauntings.
If those character descriptions haven't 

44
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,624
tipped you off already,
the heroes and hill house aren't your 

45
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,670
typical cookie cutter characters and 
other horror series,

46
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,980
but to understand how they're so 
different,

47
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,120
we first have to understand an idea and 
writing called the ghost,

48
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,103
which has been explored by the author K 
and Weiland as we'll see what makes the 

49
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,124
haunting of hill house so good is the 
blurry boundary between Weiland's ghost 

50
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,060
as technique and the show's ghost as,
oh my God,

51
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:47,230
what the fuck is wrong with that kid?

52
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,483
As for wildland scopes.
The idea is this at the beginning of a 

53
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:51,784
story,
our heroes aren't usually the greatest 

54
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,334
people.
They can be jealous like woody and toy 

55
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:00,670
story or selfish like ebeneezer scrooge 
and a Christmas according to wildland.

56
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,533
At the heart of these personal feelings 
lies a basic psychological mechanism in 

57
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:10,240
which we value survival in one aspect of
our lives over survival in another.

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
In other words,
we'd lean into certain beliefs even 

59
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,050
though they might make us unhappy just 
so we can survive.

60
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,390
And the reason why we formed these 
beliefs,

61
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,900
Weiland calls this your ghost though 
other authors,

62
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,700
we'll call it your wound or simply your 
past trauma for woody in toy story,

63
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,683
his ghost or trauma is the knowledge 
that unloved toys are discarded causing 

64
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,334
his jealousy of buzz,
which blinds him to his unsavory 

65
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,330
behavior.
For Scrooge,

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,720
his ghost is the poverty he experienced 
in his childhood,

67
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,420
which later causes him to be the penny 
pinching man.

68
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,170
We all know blinding him to the fact 
that he has ruined his life.

69
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,303
What he and scrooge up to protect their 
wound fear and poverty respectively at 

70
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:56,410
the expense of everything else.
In the haunting of Hill House,

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,273
it becomes clear that the actual ghosts 
are some kind of metaphor for the 

72
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,980
horrifying events the crane family 
faces.

73
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,053
Chevron are,
Mike Flanagan expertly leverages each 

74
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,874
character's past trauma or ghost to 
explain why our heroes are so messed up 

75
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:12,454
as adults.
Steve witnessing his mother's friend 

76
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,463
mental state firsthand rationalizes his 
whole childhood as a product of mental 

77
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,800
illness.
In fact,

78
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,634
he's so convinced that his family has a 
genetic mental condition that he gets a 

79
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,504
vasectomy right out of college.
I was there something wrong with our 

80
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,240
goddamn brains.
So yeah,

81
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:36,241
I'm never having children.
I made sure surely who takes in a box of

82
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,444
kittens as a child only to have them go 
dead and crazy demonic becomes 

83
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,170
fascinated with the way morticians fix a
person making a corpse seem alive again.

84
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,420
That's what I do,
unsurprisingly.

85
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:56,410
She then becomes a control freak.
Mortician as for Theo,

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,273
her special ability to understand the 
essence of something by touching it 

87
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,210
backfires when she touches her mom and 
sees a rotting corpse.

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,130
And how does the o turnout as an adult,
she flexes her ability to help people in

89
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:09,964
her day job while wearing gloves in her 
free time and having shallow emotional 

90
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,330
relationships.
And Luke,

91
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,313
well,
Luke's substance abuse stems from 

92
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,384
watching his mom poison and kill his 
childhood friend and from the various 

93
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,930
obsessive coping mechanisms he developed
to distract himself.

94
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,063
Like any good story though,
the haunting of hill house builds out 

95
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,650
it's conflicts by having characters 
confront their trauma.

96
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,770
And this is the part where we get to the
literal ghosts of the show.

97
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,950
Now there's a seriously large grab bag 
of ghosts in the series.

98
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,210
In fact,
if you look hard enough,

99
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,630
you can see a random ghosts lingering in
the background of almost any shot.

100
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,913
And while there's a whole cast of ghouls
that have almost nothing to do with our 

101
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,304
characters back stories,
the most memorable ghost or the 

102
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,020
personified embodiments of our 
characters,

103
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:57,530
past traumas in psychoanalytic terms,
we could view these literal ghosts as an

104
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,364
example of splitting where people 
splinter off and repackage the negative 

105
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:02,924
parts of themselves or others,
nor to maintain a positive sense of 

106
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,090
self.
It's like Weiland said,

107
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,080
it's all about survival except in the 
crane family's case.

108
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,890
The unconference did trauma manifests as
actual ghost.

109
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,970
The literary ghost becomes a literal 
ghosts.

110
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,680
It's in the red room where all these 
literal manifestations of trauma come to

111
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,514
the fore.
It's real is like the heart of the 

112
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,210
house,
not a hard to stomach.

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,373
And the series closing episodes,
all of our surviving crane children 

114
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,704
converge in the red room.
We're the house puts them each to a 

115
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,734
mental test.
They must confront their literal and 

116
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,450
metaphorical ghost.
For Steve,

117
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,284
he must confront his concern over his 
family's tainted blood line when he 

118
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:49,160
experiences a room 1408 moment and is 
transported into the future,

119
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,180
or he got out of Hill House alive,
complete with a happy pregnant wife.

120
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,343
That is until he realizes he never left 
the house and his wife's baby becomes a 

121
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:00,170
literal rot splitting open her stomach.
Yeah,

122
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,300
it's pretty gruesome.
Surely on the other hand,

123
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:05,030
must confront her inability to fix 
everything,

124
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,893
including her personal shortcomings.
And she does so by reliving her own 

125
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,794
secret affair.

126
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,390
You did it any light in and you just 
decided not to look at it.

127
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,220
Now that's all over.

128
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,830
Charlene never wants to look.
Things are even worse for Fiona.

129
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,664
She grapples with her self imposed 
emotional isolation while on the bed 

130
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,414
with her casual lover feel loses her 
ability to feel anything at all and a 

131
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,660
thousand hands drag her down.
And Luke,

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,130
well Lucas transported back in time back
to the tea party with his mom,

133
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:39,430
his twin now,
and his childhood friend Luke glimpsing.

134
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:43,330
A life without the pain of addiction or 
the death of the three people closest to

135
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:48,331
him is tempted to sit down and give it.
That is until Nell saves him go.

136
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,300
Okay,

137
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,720
why would you want your brother to go,
hey,

138
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,040
just got here,
have a seat.

139
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,373
Don't exactly as she saves all the crane
children by pulling them out of their 

140
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,570
nightmares.
Now,

141
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:07,200
some of you might think that Nell 
swooping in is a Dsx Mokena ending,

142
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,250
but as story guru slash wise crack 
favorite Dan harmon would tell you,

143
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,263
the characters in this portion of the 
story have earned it by confronting the 

144
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:20,340
worst parts of themselves in their past.
They've grown as people and the universe

145
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,790
is responding by throwing them a 
lifeline in the form of now.

146
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,983
Case in point now literally forgives 
each one of them before stressing the 

147
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:32,991
importance of love,
forgiveness like a tear on a cheek.

148
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,380
Thank you for that and then for me when 
you stand in the rain.

149
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,843
Okay.
Hmm.

150
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I loved you completely.
You loved me the same.

151
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,123
That's all

152
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,840
the rest is confetti.
After Nell,

153
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,423
the father exchanges his life in order 
to free his children and the group 

154
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,990
escapes having conquered both their 
literal and metaphorical ghosts.

155
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,660
The cranes then go on to lead fulfilling
lives,

156
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,553
free of the supernatural.
Steve reconciles with his expect and 

157
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,450
wife.
Shirley comes clean with her husband.

158
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,800
Feo throws her gloves away and commits 
to a real relationship and luke hits the

159
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,634
two years sober mark surrounded by his 
siblings in showing us these happy 

160
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:21,864
endings.
The haunting of hill house is firmly 

161
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:26,340
making a statement that there is light 
in the darkness,

162
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,323
that trauma can be overcome.
It's like what Steve said about fear 

163
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,080
feel to it where we find it,
we cannot meet halfway and if surrounded

164
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,080
by family or love,
perhaps we can face it directly.

165
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,930
So what do you guys think is the 
haunting of Hill House?

166
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,400
Really that scary is it's use of ghosts 
that much of a departure from the horror

167
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,180
genre.

168
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,013
Well drop us a line in the comments and 
let us know and if you're too scared to 

169
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,124
sleep,
there's nothing better than 

170
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,550
decompressing by shooting people in the 
face.

171
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,563
I'm talking about Fort Night.
It's free to play and so easy to 

172
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:04,560
download on pc Mac,
ps four xbox one switch ios and android.

173
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,900
Jump on Oh battle bus and head to an 
island.

174
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,763
The last man standing wins the game.
You could also customize your 

175
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,274
experience,
dress up in different skins or collect 

176
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,494
customized weapons.
Obviously my favorite thing are the 

177
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,704
dance moves.
There's nothing quite like trying to 

178
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,580
stay relevant with the kids by threading
or whatever.

179
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,414
This is if you can play solo or duos and
squads with friends for nine is always 

180
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:25,974
adding new things to the game.
So even if you're familiar with the 

181
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:28,614
fortnight verse,
checkout all the new cosmetics they've 

182
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:33,570
added for season six and this includes 
pets.

183
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,030
If you're ready to play,
click the link in the description.

184
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,040
And as always,
thanks for watching guys.

185
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,103
Please.
