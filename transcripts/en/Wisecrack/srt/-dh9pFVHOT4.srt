00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,693
Hey wise crack.
Jared here with our third and final 

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,610
exploration of Christopher Nolan's weird
wild mind.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,713
And our first installment,
we examined Nolan's idea of the self 

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,800
charting the relationships between our 
subjective perceptions and the notion of

7
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,960
objective reality.
Unfortunately,

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:28,050
our investigation's still came too late 
to save poor teddy.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,473
In the second installment,
we use no one's dark knight trilogy to 

10
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,384
discuss the fragile dynamics of society 
and the ways in which social norms are 

11
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,780
tested and upended by symbols,
by desire,

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,990
and all too often by hoking Weirdos in 
mass.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,863
Good.

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,863
And now in our third act will attempt to
find some catharsis by looking to the 

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,750
universe per response to the fragile 
nature of humanity.

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,763
I want to know where we are.
So strap in because this is the final 

17
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,310
installment of the philosophy of 
Christopher Nolan.

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,323
Oh,
and we'll be answering your questions 

19
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:05,630
for the first hour in the comments.
So we'll see you there.

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,643
And of course spoilers ahead.
Whereas no one's previous works focused 

21
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,560
on the inevitable conflict inherent in 
humanities.

22
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:15,740
Rational nature,
interstellar attempts to transcend these

23
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:16,574
burdens by looking to the broad expanses
of the universe and hopes of ridding us 

24
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:20,714
from the social and physical restraints 
explored in videos one and two of this 

25
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:24,704
series.
By merging a sense of wide eyed wonder 

26
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,520
with the thrilling advancements of 
science,

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,443
Nolan Helps Cooper and us break free of 
the expectations leveled against the 

28
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,440
self and society from as early as it's 
opening scenes.

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,130
Interstellar situates his protagonists 
cooper as an ambitious innovator,

30
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,150
but also as a clear,
I'd advocate for science and reason with

31
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,023
facts and present your conclusion.
He's also a guy with a pretty healthy 

32
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:53,390
skepticism of power and authority.
It's an old federal textbook.

33
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,340
We've replaced them with the corrected 
versions,

34
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,263
correct,
but before the films adventure is done 

35
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:58,634
with him,
Cooper will have to reconcile his data 

36
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,370
driven beliefs with the mind expanding 
unpredictability of the great beyond.

37
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,120
Although cooper is firmly committed to 
his own sense of practicality,

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,083
is eventually forced to navigate the 
fluid boundary between the real and the 

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,123
Iran deal.
The latter of which is a concept 

40
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:17,030
introduced by American philosopher 
Nelson Goodman,

41
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,570
but what is the aerial exactly in his 
work?

42
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:24,500
The ways of rope making good and 
explored the notion of alternative world

43
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:27,050
versions at its most basic 
interpretation.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,913
This concept allowed for everything from
art to mathematics to be perceived and 

45
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,290
understood in a variety of ways.

46
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,270
Take a look at this piece of art for 
example,

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,670
and you might see a woman's face or a 
goblet.

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,730
Both interpretations here are correct in
total,

49
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,593
but only one interpretation is correct 
through one particular context at a 

50
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,674
time,
and this in essence is the art of the 

51
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,053
realities.
There are multiple ways to look at the 

52
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:54,410
world and no one method is better in 
every instance.

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,363
As such,
the way the film's mysterious beings 

54
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,004
experienced the universe opens up a for 
a new way to experience and know the 

55
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,704
universe,
just not in the way we're used to with 

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,990
you know,
time is a thing that passes in space.

57
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:12,400
Cooper is confronted with the real,
nothing abides by his conventional ideas

58
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,234
of time or even cause and effect.
Cooper as a man of science has some 

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,800
difficulty adjusting to a new normal and
through that difficult adjustment,

60
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,680
no one is openly able to question me.
Physical,

61
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:27,190
spatial and chronological laws that we 
and cooper,

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,053
how long the leave to be absolute 
throughout much of interstellar hyman 

63
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,344
space do not interact with us in a way 
we might traditionally expect and 

64
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:36,694
neither as it turns out,
does all American hero Matt Damon on a 

65
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,940
new plane of existence in which even 
time can be warped

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,260
gravity on that planet will slow our 
clock compared to Earth's drastically.

67
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,120
Every hour we spend on that planet will 
be seven years back on her.

68
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,800
What asks,
Nolan is left to ground us humans.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,260
What lighthouse is there to help us 
navigate,

70
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,050
to give us purpose and direction?
Thankfully,

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,420
interstellar not only poses this 
question,

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,313
it provides an answer and that answer is
the one place technology cannot touch 

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,953
human emotion.
Although the characters of interstellar 

74
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:16,290
frequently doubt what is real and what 
is trustworthy there snot filled,

75
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,124
tear drench deeply emotional experiences
provide them with the ballast focus and 

76
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:21,684
resolve to see their adventure through 
to the end and those components of 

77
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:28,500
humanity or the very sorts of things.
Science alone can't provide.

78
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,690
In fact,
near the beginning of the film,

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,850
it's suggested the crash landing that 
stalled Cooper's aviation career was the

80
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,170
result of his reliance on technology 
alone.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,550
We should ease Andrew.
I can see him case.

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,830
The only time I ever went down in the 
machine was easy and at the wrong time.

83
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,113
Ultimately,
it's human connection and emotion and 

84
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,010
capsulated in doctor brands.
Love for Dr Edmonds.

85
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,950
Love is the one thing we're capable of 
perceiving that transcends dimensions of

86
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:54,880
time and space

87
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,570
that leads this crew to the habitable 
planet they so desperately seek.

88
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,613
Now,
that's not to say the film is 

89
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,250
anti-science far from it.
Instead,

90
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:07,540
it demonstrates something more complex 
that science is necessary,

91
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,830
but by itself is an insufficient 
condition for a journey of discovery.

92
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,790
Science alone can't solve our problems 
of limited resources,

93
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,920
identity,
or societal violence.

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,890
In interstellar.
Science needs something more.

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,230
It needs emotion.
It needs love to fuel and guided.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,980
It requires human subjectivities that 
launches us beyond facts and figures and

97
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:30,814
shiny chrome.

98
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,400
They have access to infinite time and 
space,

99
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,234
but they're not bound by anything.
They can find a specific place in time 

100
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,400
we can communicate.
That's why I'm,

101
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,930
yeah,

102
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,763
and in that sense,
interstellar represents something of a 

103
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,534
capstone in the Christopher Nolan 
experience in the face of the questions 

104
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,660
of identity that arrives from the self 
and from society.

105
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,523
Interstellar responds by showing how 
scientific advancements merged with the 

106
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,454
intangibles of the human.
Provide us with the necessary thrust or 

107
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,940
new frontiers and personal liberation.

108
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,950
If there's an answer here on earth,
it's back there somehow in that room.

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,580
Of course,
the technology exhibited an interstellar

110
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,414
is not up today's world.
It's instead rooted in speculative 

111
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:14,494
fiction,
and that's where the film itself even 

112
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:19,540
acts as an elegant marriage of science 
and imagination.

113
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,920
It shows us worlds and innovations we've
never seen before with interstellar.

114
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:27,460
Christopher Nolan confronts us with the 
power of hyper [inaudible] cinema,

115
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,503
image driven storytelling up an imagined
future that can influence and 

116
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:32,344
emotionally fuel us in the present.
And that future urges us to make the 

117
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,194
Iran real real,
even if we have to crawl to the 

118
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:39,940
uncertainties of time and space to do 
it.

119
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,600
At least we're fueled by love along the 
way with interstellar,

120
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,770
no one presents new worlds and realities
that push us far from the violence,

121
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,950
self destructive climate of the dark 
knight trilogy or Memento.

122
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,083
And in these new worlds,
no one offers us an optimistic glimpse 

123
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,440
of our own possible future.

124
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,620
So why did he follow this story with 
Dunkirk?

125
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,483
A film about the allied evacuation from 
bloody war time conflict in 1940 the 

126
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:07,630
short answer perhaps is that Dunkirk is 
about our future too.

127
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,070
In both interstellar and Dunkirk.
Nolan unites his audience in celebrating

128
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:12,904
the indomitable spirit of the human.
The notion that man and woman is 

129
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:17,224
essentially good.
The notion that each of us is built to 

130
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,690
persevere.
This is evidenced in much of Christopher

131
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,910
Nolan's recent work,
including the dark knight rises.

132
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,840
When catwoman tells Batman she's bailing
and assures him she's no hero,

133
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,903
I'll open that tunnel.
Then I'm gone only to prove herself 

134
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,034
wrong in the 11th hour,
how sweet interstellar furthers this 

135
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,024
cheerful embrace of human decency and 
capability by using love to push cooper 

136
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:44,290
all the way to the end of his journey.
Cooper's own indomitable spirit,

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,153
powerfully fueled by the love for his 
daughter proves enough to ensure his 

138
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:48,910
success.

139
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,743
What could be a clear example of that 
emotional potency that unflappable will 

140
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,780
to persevere?
Then both the British referred to as the

141
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:56,614
dunkirk spirit,
a term that's been used to convey 

142
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:01,540
solidarity since the days of that bloody
battle in World War II,

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,510
the dunkirk spirit is defined by a sense
of community,

144
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,463
a willingness by a group of people who 
are in a bad situation to all help each 

145
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:11,320
other.
The film invest a deep sense of communal

146
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:14,230
spirit,
a spirit best embodied in Mr.

147
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,840
Dawson.
Despite lacking any military technology.

148
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,080
This guy pilots is small boat into 
violent conflict,

149
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,943
commits himself to saving the lives of 
strangers and emerges victorious thanks 

150
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:27,100
to the sheer power of will you have a 
tender on?

151
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,810
Oh,
we have a job to do.

152
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,690
Mister Dawson's instrumentation is not 
technical,

153
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,583
but internal.
The step beyond interstellar and the 

154
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:39,250
purest possible connection between the 
self society and the spiritual unknown,

155
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,800
much like Doctor Emilia brand and 
interstellar,

156
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,670
Mr.
Dawson,

157
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:46,480
it's resolutely piloted by love,
but while Mr.

158
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,313
Dawson was unable to save his son,
he is in a sense still able to save the 

159
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,470
conceptual image of his son with each 
life.

160
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,950
Mr.
Dawson rescues during dunkirk escape.

161
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,540
How'd you know that stuff?
Anyway,

162
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,280
our son was running you loud.
I know she is,

163
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,260
and you know what?
That achievement might just be something

164
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:07,640
even more noble and significant in the 
realm of the indomitable human spirit.

165
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,810
Dunkirk suggests sometimes the Iran deal
is more real than real.

166
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,600
Not only is this scene in the choices 
the characters make,

167
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,434
but in the way the film is constructed.
Dunkirk is structured in such a way as 

168
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:22,010
to reveal the purest distillation of 
this communal concept.

169
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,140
I didn't want to tell the story in words
I didn't want people,

170
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,823
I didn't want the theatrical.
If people telling the audience why you 

171
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,654
should care about,
I wanted to care about him just because 

172
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,420
of the physical situation or they were 
in

173
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,403
where many of Nolan's previous films 
have been criticized for being too long 

174
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:39,974
to dialogue heavy and expository dunkirk
hawks in and only 107 minutes offers 

175
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,044
backstory for almost none of its 
characters and really doesn't have much 

176
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,550
interest in conversation.
In other words,

177
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,780
no one created a sense of solidarity 
between the viewers and soldiers without

178
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:56,570
relying on the tools often used to draw 
in audiences.

179
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,523
Essentially it plunks us here with every
bullet fired in with every ship 

180
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,590
destroyed.
Dunkirk aims to access the psychological

181
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,424
concept of an affective empathy,
the ability not just to know or to 

182
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:08,444
understand what someone is feeling,
but to feel that feeling before it 

183
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,790
occurs in interviews about the 
production of Dunkirk,

184
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,660
no one said his ambition was to create 
virtual reality without the headset.

185
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,613
In other words,
a fully an effective experience for the 

186
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,434
viewer,
whether Nolan's successfully reached 

187
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:25,340
this goal is up to each individual 
viewer to decide,

188
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,470
but the blending of science,
technology,

189
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:28,304
and imagination to create an immersive 
sense of participation in the dunkirk 

190
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:31,760
spirit.

191
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,593
Well,
that might just be Nolan's loudest call 

192
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:38,330
to each of us to bind together in 
shaping and perfecting the self,

193
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,640
society,
and future that we want.

194
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,683
No one's most recent film,
didn't just bring him a boatload of 

195
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,474
Oscar nominations.
It also brought together the threads of 

196
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:47,384
his earlier work,
ultimately illustrating the power of 

197
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,264
love and the human spirit.
Christopher Nolan is one of the most 

198
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,503
interesting filmmakers working today.
His movies aren't only visceral and 

199
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,970
exciting,
but also extremely thoughtful,

200
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,560
a rare blend in today's Hollywood.
This is merely our interpretation of his

201
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,690
work,
but as with any mastercraftsman,

202
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,470
his work will continue to inspire new 
thought for years to come.

203
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,663
