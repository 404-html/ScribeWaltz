1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,790
Hey guys,
Helen here,

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,040
wisecracks resident science nerd.
Well,

3
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:10,874
14 year old.
Jared was waiting in line seven hours 

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,274
early for the matrix reloaded.
I was playing with my star wars action 

5
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:16,574
figures,
acting out weird love triangles between 

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,113
on Django and Princess Leia and trying 
to convince my family that my home 

7
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,664
planet was actually older on,
so I decided to flex my star wars 

8
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,204
geekery for this discussion of Disney's 
latest installment in the star wars 

9
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,624
cinematic universe solo.
The movie fills in the backstory of our 

10
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:33,644
favorite smuggler,
turned hero showing us how a young Han 

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,853
transforms into the legendary Han Solo,
sort of given that the other films have 

12
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:42,344
been massive cash cows solo was expected
to do pretty well even considering the 

13
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:49,160
last jet I backlash and potential 
franchise fatigue,

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,353
but solo flopped.
It's on track to be the first 

15
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:56,780
unprofitable star wars film ever.
They should surprise you for one reason.

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,943
Everything about this movie is designed 
to be marketable and give you the warm 

17
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:03,050
fuzzies,
so what went wrong?

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,130
Let's take a look in this wisecrack 
addition on how even psychology couldn't

19
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,560
sell solo thanks to our sponsor,
brilliant.org

20
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,050
for making this video possible,
and as always,

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,030
spoilers solo kicks off sometime around 
the year 13 bb,

22
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:17,864
why that's 30 to 64 on the lawful 
calendar and ends roughly 10 years 

23
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,424
before rogue one and a new hope.
The movie follows aspiring pilot and 

24
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:26,254
[inaudible] to be Han as he goes from a 
bright eyed romantic to an outlaw who 

25
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,104
shoots first.

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,273
Alright,

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,203
along the way,
he picks up a level below 190 year old 

28
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,410
Wiki,
a notorious techno sexual smuggler,

29
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,303
and the Millennium Falcon doesn't quite 
pull off the Kessel run in less than 12 

30
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,310
parsecs unless you round down.
Here's Solos,

31
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,144
fundamental strategy,
make us nostalgic for the good old days 

32
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,624
of star wars by cramming in as many 
Easter eggs and nods to the past our 

33
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,060
wars as possible.
There's the golden dice,

34
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,000
the planet Solutia Viper droids,
mandalorian armor,

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,220
Jabba the Hutt boss,
the bounty hunter,

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,590
Colo crawfish,
and of course darth Maul,

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,520
and that's just scratching the surface.
The movie is one Easter Egg.

38
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:08,354
After the next pulling references,
not only from the films but also from 

39
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:14,720
the novelizations,
the video games and the animated series,

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,703
the reference to Rsa,
Lando skies from return of the Jedi and 

41
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,034
cure is impressive.
Command of terrorist Khasi are great 

42
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:24,890
ways to make fans who know two 
generations worth of star wars lore feel

43
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,660
like they have a special connection to 
the film,

44
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,590
but despite the outstanding fan service 
and some great deep cuts,

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,480
the movie falls short because nostalgia 
alone can't propel a film and might even

46
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,314
get in the way.

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,850
Well,
I can't read Disney's mind.

48
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,840
The reason they relied on all this 
nostalgia seems pretty obvious.

49
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,763
Marketers use nostalgia to sell stuff 
all the time and it's no different in 

50
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,540
movies.
Just look at the force awakens.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,433
Besides bringing back the actual 
characters and actors from the original 

52
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,840
trilogy,
the film paid homage to its predecessors

53
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,820
in the form of things like trash 
compactors,

54
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,900
pod racing,
flags,

55
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,090
and even that Werewolf alien thing from 
the Mos.

56
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
Cantina neuroscience has a possible 
explanation for why this trick can be 

57
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,730
super effective.
It involves the brain's reward system.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,450
Some imaging studies have shown that the
parts of the brain tied to feelings like

59
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,284
pleasure,
motivation and euphoria are activated 

60
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,630
when you're experiencing a stalled jet,
so for long time star wars fans,

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,493
seeing things like Han's dice and 
hearing the sound of the ethereal 

62
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,554
fighters or like a jump to hyperspace 
for the feel good pathways in your 

63
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,124
brain,
which is exactly what Disney wants to 

64
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,674
happen because then you'll keep coming 
back for more or buy some solo dice 

65
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,200
cufflinks and a tee shirt,
but nostalgia.

66
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,034
Marketing aside,
these Easter eggs do something else in 

67
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,274
the case of humor.
Being on the receiving end of an inside 

68
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,004
joke makes us feel more affiliation with
the jokester and makes them seem more 

69
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,510
socially desirable.

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,393
I understood that reference and 
according to the encryption theory of 

71
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,920
humor,
jokes are funny,

72
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,050
not just because of their superficial 
content,

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,033
but because they broadcast shared 
knowledge between the person and their 

74
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,604
audience.
So if you caught yourself laughing in 

75
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,724
the scene where is losing it over being 
beaten at Gerrick or the one where he's 

76
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:06,414
holding up the guard severed arms.
The writers did their job from a 

77
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:09,684
psychology standpoint.
The fact that Disney shares your inside 

78
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:15,970
knowledge that peoples' arms off makes 
you feel like they get it.

79
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,920
Droid don't pull people's arms out of 
their sockets when they lose,

80
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,720
but here's where solo lands itself in 
trouble.

81
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,093
Plenty of movies have inside jokes and 
references will also giving us well 

82
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:32,834
developed characters,
but in the process of doubling down on 

83
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,174
the stall did Easter eggs.
Disney fails to give us a legit origin 

84
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,860
story.
Solos.

85
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,140
Fundamental problem is that Alden 
Ehrenreich has to convince us.

86
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,200
He's Harrison Ford's Han Solo from the 
very start.

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,630
He's got the arrogance,
the wisecracks,

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,553
the hustle hard,
supposed to transition is basically 75 

89
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,670
percent complete right from the 
beginning,

90
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,310
so by the time he shoots back at the 
end,

91
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,323
it doesn't seem like much of a change.
He's been acting like Harrison Ford the 

92
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,254
whole time.
The film makes gestures of a 

93
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,624
transformation,
but they seem halfhearted when cram 

94
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:08,760
between 8,000
other nostalgia triggers as a result for

95
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:09,594
a film that promises to showcase a 
development of one of the most beloved 

96
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:13,224
characters and Saifai history.
It feels more like a buzzfeed top 10 

97
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,094
list of Han Solo Trivia,
even significant plot points like the 

98
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:24,420
way Han gets his last name meets Lando 
or winds the Millennium Falcon.

99
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,500
Feel like Easter eggs take Han's 
relationship with chewy Han's,

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,393
only known him for a couple of minutes 
before the relationship has the same 

101
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:34,290
dynamic as it does throughout the rest 
of the saga.

102
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,363
Normally we'd expect this kind of 
connection to develop and mature over 

103
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:41,100
time,
but because Disney's top priority was to

104
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,760
trigger nostalgia and familiarity rather
than the truly show development,

105
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,773
it ends up feeling shallow.
The movie gets it out of the way and 

106
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,164
moves onto the next bit of Trivia.
The point of an origin story is to show 

107
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:56,400
us how a character we know and love 
comes to be who they are.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,473
For Batman Begins Shows Bruce Wayne 
mastering his fears to become the 

109
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:04,310
legendary dark night.
Bruce starts out as a troubled,

110
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,860
angsty,
scared youth at the beginning and by the

111
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,650
end he's disciplined and unafraid.
Dr.

112
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,573
strange starts off as a self centered 
surgeon who only believes in cold 

113
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,640
rationality and ends the film as a self 
sacrificial mystic.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,833
But to be honest,
I kind of get it when you're recasting 

115
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,744
such an iconic role,
you can stuck between a rock and a hard 

116
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,160
place.
If Hans antiques at the beginning seemed

117
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:25,994
completely different than Harrison Ford,
the audience wouldn't believe they were 

118
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:29,684
watching Han Solo.
But if you have him act like Ford Solo 

119
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:32,744
from the beginning,
you sacrifice a convincing arc for 

120
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,774
familiarity.
If we were to try to give the fillmore 

121
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,443
credit,
we might say that the arc is Han going 

122
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,114
from an aspiring scoundrel to an 
idealist when he decides to hand over 

123
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,280
the hyper fuel to the budding 
resistance.

124
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,260
But isn't that the exact same arc from a
new foe?

125
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,333
At worst,
the film has no work and at best it's a 

126
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,094
retread of episode four.
That's not to say solo doesn't have 

127
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,064
moments of fun,
but that's really the best thing you 

128
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,660
could say about it and hey,
if that's what you're looking for,

129
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,090
it's a good time.
But in our opinion,

130
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,013
Disney could have done better by 
delivering an intriguing character 

131
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,433
rather than relying on Cipa Pilsen a 
soldier in the form of endless Easter 

132
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,790
eggs.
But that's our take.

On the other hand,

if you'd rather work hard for your 
dopamine hits,

135
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
see if you can solve this riddle.
If I were to tell you that the combined 

136
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,980
area of the blue triangles is 25 and the
five red squares are identical,

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
what does the area of the entire shape 
pull out some scrap paper if you need 

138
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:33,194
it.

they've got a great module and 
artificial neural networks which are 

144
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,890
like real neural networks,
but our official,

they've also got an awesome section on 
engineering,

146
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,073
which is something that kind of makes me
want to go back to school one more time

to become an engineer.
