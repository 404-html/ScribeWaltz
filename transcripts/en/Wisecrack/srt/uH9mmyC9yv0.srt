00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
This video is brought to you by wix.
What's up guys?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,433
Jared here.
We're always getting requests from fans 

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,520
saying,
you guys have got the cover.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,280
Insert movie TV show,
video game,

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,260
mean book,
sarcastic joke here.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,273
We'll then enthusiastically watch it,
brainstorm for a really long time and 

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,834
often come up empty handed.
It's not that we can't think of 

8
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,670
anything.
The show might hint at ideas,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,200
but not fully developed them or evidence
keeps coming up refuting our argument or

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,530
sometimes a show was just plain 
inconsistent or hey,

11
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:36,330
maybe we're just too dumb to figure it 
out.

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,910
So when it came time to look at Netflix 
is surreal.

13
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,470
Retro,
Futuristic Love Story.

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,453
We didn't quite get where we hoped.
We dug and dug and found some really 

15
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,344
cool stuff,
but a cohesive philosophy of not quite 

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,480
so we're going to do something a bit 
different.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,433
We're going to go through the ideas we 
considered show how and when they work 

18
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,034
within the context of the show and why 
we ultimately decided not to go with it 

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,773
and hey,
maybe this will serve as a foundation 

20
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:04,020
for you to think about the show in new 
ways.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,200
This is another experiment for us,
so be sure to let us know what you think

22
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:12,130
in the comments and without further ado,

Crack Half Baked addition on superbad to
maniac and yup spoilers ahead,

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,293

Alright guys,

33
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:42,480
so first a quick recap is an order wish 
me luck.

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,170
Maniac primarily focuses on Owen milgrom
and Annie Landsberg.

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,580
Oh,
in the schizophrenia.

36
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,443
Black sheep of a very wealthy family,
struggles with delusions of saving the 

37
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,800
world and a made up brother and a broker
with a dysfunctional family,

38
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,634
struggles with drug addiction to cope 
with the death of her sister and the 

39
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,540
estrangement of her mother.

40
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,643
They enter a highly experimental 
pharmaceutical study run by three 

41
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,154
doctors and a supercomputer called dirty
that hopes to eradicate psychological 

42
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,821
pain by having patients identify map and
ultimately confront their issues through

43
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:17,940
drug induced fantasies nd and Owen's 
wires get crossed,

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,803
causing them to inhabit each other's 
fantasies where they experienced whole 

45
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,100
lifetimes together,
Gerd.

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,973
He gets depressed up to the death of Dr.
Morimoto threatening the experiment and 

47
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:30,780
the subjects inside the final fantasy,
any comforts.

48
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,614
The computer finds the resolve to move 
past her sister's death while Owen 

49
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:35,814
confronts the fact that his fantasy 
brother is just an idealized version of 

50
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:39,774
his crappy real brother.
He saves the other patients and back in 

51
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,284
the real world,
finds the confidence to stand up to his 

52
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,074
family and the end.
Any friendship inspires Owen to escape 

53
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,794
from a psych ward and have faith in his 
ability to function or was that a 

54
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,774
fantasy?

55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,020
All right.
Now onto the pitches organized from best

56
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:01,510
to worst for your entertainment pitch.
One Don Quixote.

57
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,930
This one is an eight out of 10.
Almost good enough for video.

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,860
Miguel de Savantas is modern.
Classic is everywhere in Maniac.

59
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,970
One of the fantasy scenarios even 
revolves around one nanny infiltrating a

60
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:16,360
seance to find the fictional last,
final chapter of the novel.

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,570
So why this focus on an old book?
Well,

62
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,404
let's break it down.
Don Quixote tells the story of Alonzo 

63
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,893
Cayetano,
who become so obsessed with books about 

64
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,140
chivalry that his mind dries out.
Essentially,

65
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,093
he goes mad,
which makes this line extra ironic at 

66
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,063
this time is I am healthy andy now and 
healthy people read books inspired by 

67
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,790
his books.
Alonzo decides to become a knight errant

68
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,624
himself.
The bulk of the book follows him as he 

69
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,874
goes on wild adventures,
including the one where he famously 

70
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,270
attacks windmills.

71
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,930
He mistakes as giant windmills happens 
to be the name of maniacs.

72
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,764
Second episode,
which briefly features and looking at 

73
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,510
some during the road trip that ends in 
her sister's death,

74
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,090
but trust me,
it gets deeper than that already.

75
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:01,924
We can draw a parallel between the 
madness that makes don quixote one to 

76
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,324
perform heroic acts and Owen 
schizophrenia that makes him believe 

77
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,780
that he will save the world like Don 
Quixote.

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,673
Oh,
and can't distinguish reality from 

79
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,380
fiction.
The more than that,

80
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,214
Don Quixote inhabits a dreamlike 
mindspace that makes castles of ens and 

81
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:24,481
giants of windmills turning the regular 
world into a fantastic one.

82
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,030
Similarly,
the ULP treatment turns its patients sad

83
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,150
realities into fully fledged fantasy 
adventures,

84
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,270
and he's Lemur.
Painting becomes a bizarre recovered.

85
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,700
The lemur story.
The copy of Don Quixote,

86
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,350
she picks up,
becomes the steel.

87
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,184
The final chapter plot Andy and Lee 
watching a lord of the rings esque show 

88
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,534
becomes this,
and Owen's hawk that kills Ernie verbal 

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,970
inspires the save the world from alien's
tail.

90
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,290
This is madness.
I love Danny.

91
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,560
If I wasn't secret agent,
I would know I was a secret agent,

92
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,423
but perhaps the most powerful connection
between the two works is the shared 

93
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,850
theme of transformation through the 
power of dreams.

94
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,920
Congratulations.
You're a hero.

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,433
In the case of the dons delusions,
he adventures so that he may 

96
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,980
reinvigorate a golden age when people 
were more authentic,

97
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,450
as he says bless at the time and blessed
at the centuries called by the ancients,

98
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,660
the Golden Age,
and that time women spoke their thoughts

99
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,494
of love from the soul simply and 
pretentiously exactly as they thought 

100
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,820
them not searching for elaborate verbal 
circumlocutions to beautify them,

101
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,610
truth and simplicity.
We're unmixed with fraud,

102
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:34,444
deceit and malice.
Justice remained firm and sure either 

103
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,770
troubled nor offended against by 
patronage and self interest as today.

104
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,860
She is so grievously tainted in troubled
and persecuted.

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,780
Judges did not feel themselves as they 
do today entitled to be tyrants.

106
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,703
If Don Quixote's fantasies represents 
his yearning for the days when people 

107
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,724
weren't full of,
then one could say the ulp uses fantasy 

108
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,670
to heal a society that has been defined 
by isolation.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,833
As James suggest at the beginning,
all levels of physics require collision 

110
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,430
and bonding in order to progress and so 
does the human heart,

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,890
comradery,
communion,

112
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,660
family,
friendship,

113
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,690
love what have you.
We're lost without connection.

114
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,660
It's quite terrible alone.
However,

115
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,300
the world were presented is one that is 
tragically absent,

116
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,830
meaningful connection.
Hello,

117
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:28,664
Mrs Finklestein Donovan,
the first two episodes introduce a 

118
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,564
vision of New York in which people are 
more alienated from each other than 

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
ever.
Most of the human interactions we 

120
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,834
witness are purely transactional.
This is made quite literal with friend 

121
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,980
proxy,
a service that provides you with someone

122
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,814
pretending to be your friend for a fee.
You're using a service that gives you 

123
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,040
pretend.
Friends,

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,380
I have real friends.

125
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,213
This is just more convenient.
Then there's ad buddy where a human 

126
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:04,070
being pitches you a product in exchange 
for goods and services.

127
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,620
It's kind of like getting free content 
on the Internet,

128
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,454
but having to watch annoying.
There even appears to be a market for 

129
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,990
people to escape the world entirely.
Enter a void,

130
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,883
a box that basically allows you to 
hibernate your life away instead of 

131
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:22,250
engaging with the outside world.
There's also lines like this.

132
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,143
Thank you for braving the outside world 
for me and the fact that a zoomy and 

133
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,444
James Sleep in isolating drawers be 
encroachment of consumerism into every 

134
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,214
facet of our lives is further emphasized
by the omnipresence of advertisements 

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,340
from the ads that purchased Annie's face
to the neon signs blaring through Owen's

136
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:44,120
window to ad copy on bridges and maniacs
New York.

137
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,810
You can't even take a shower without 
being bludgeoned by ads.

138
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,943
So Don Quixote uses fantasy to bring 
back an ideal era of authentic 

139
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,790
expression and maniac portrays to lonely
souls,

140
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,420
finding connection through fantasy in an
era of isolation.

141
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,503
You don't do this.

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,373
I will do this.
It's important to note that in many of 

143
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:08,720
the ulp fantasies taking place in the 
real world,

144
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,853
all the creepy retro futurist stuff 
seems to disappear when trying to save 

145
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,600
her Lemur.
For instance,

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,210
the world goes from what the eighties 
thought.

147
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:20,210
The two thousands would look like to 
just the eighties,

148
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,300
but there's an important qualification 
to mention here.

149
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,660
This golden age that Don Quixote waxes 
poetic about never really happened.

150
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,630
There are many characters in the book 
who've been mown the negative effects of

151
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:33,464
chivalry books.
Deeming them trash and assuring people 

152
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,390
that there was never such an idyllic 
time.

153
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,793
I can swear to you that in fact this 
world has never seen a single one of 

154
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,324
those nights,
nor any of their grandkids or their 

155
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,414
stupidities,
and then don quixote is tricked into 

156
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:50,324
hanging up,
is lance and becoming Alonzo k Hondo 

157
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:52,934
again,
eventually renounces his madness and 

158
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,390
dies a quiet death.
Similarly,

159
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,243
Annie ends up rejecting dirties,
offered to stay in the fantasy world 

160
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,554
with her sister.
She accepts reality and together with 

161
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:06,660
Owen moves forward confidently.

162
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,043
The problem with this is that although 
it's clear that Annie's break from 

163
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:17,720
fantasy is considered a positive 
development for her character,

164
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,180
there's more ambiguity surrounding the 
conclusion of Glencoe take.

165
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,543
Are we supposed to agree with the bulk 
of the characters in the book who 

166
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,650
claimed that fantasy has done nothing 
but make him a fool?

167
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,630
Is it good that he's no longer out 
adventuring or should we look at it like

168
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:33,464
don't Antonio Moreno who says,
may God forgive you for the damage 

169
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:37,364
you've done to the whole rest of the 
world and trying to cure the wittiest 

170
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:42,800
lunatic ever seen.
Don't you see my dear sir,

171
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,440
that whatever utility there might be in 
curing him,

172
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,860
it could never match the pleasure he 
gives with his madness.

173
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,110
So why wasn't this made into a full 
video?

174
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,270
Well,
despite these really great connections,

175
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,440
what else is there to say that reality 
is better than being a mcmurphy?

176
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,230
That fantasy is a liberating force for 
humanity,

177
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,880
such an exhilarating experience.
It seems like the connection between the

178
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:05,714
two works is that they both vaguely deal
with the nature of fantasy versus 

179
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,344
reality,
but not in a way that could really 

180
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:14,870
provide a definitive philosophical 
thesis pitch to Mommy,

181
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,320
Daddy and me,
Ha.

182
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,253
I give this one a five out of 10 uptop 
we should mention owens name is Sergei 

183
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,393
milgrom is a reference to the milgram 
experiment in which subjects were given 

184
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:25,754
the ability to electrocute people and 
continue to harm them under the 

185
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,950
suggestion of an authority figure.
Pretty cool.

186
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:31,784
Shout out,
but didn't really see how it connected 

187
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,424
to any of the events in the series.
There's also some serious freud and 

188
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,670
undertones.
James is a pair of fillic,

189
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,870
meaning he's attracted to inanimate 
objects.

190
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,350
You also has a strange relationship with
his mother.

191
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,013
In fact,
if we want to get all oedipal and we 

192
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,100
always do,
the oedipal triangle of mother,

193
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:56,360
father and child seemed to be important 
for many of the main characters and he's

194
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:57,980
mother walked out on her father.

195
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,023
Owen's dad is an overbearing,
fascist and mantle ray also without a 

196
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:06,950
father in his life near drove my father 
away and you slept in my bed,

197
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:07,784
way too much,
literally goes blind after confronting 

198
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,690
his mother.
Can't see,

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,553
not so different than say a tragic 
figure who stabs his eyes out after 

200
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,174
romancing is madre.
He also built a computer model on its 

201
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:20,684
mother's mind,
and while that's not in the Greek 

202
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,930
tragedy,
it seems pertinent.

203
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,953
The computer is you play.
The ulp test also functions on the idea 

204
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:35,360
that our mental ailments can mostly be 
attributed to some unresolved trauma.

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,553
For Freud,
many of our neuroses and mental health 

206
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:38,984
problems were brought on by unresolved 
trauma that we must work through the 

207
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:44,990
three stages of the ULP treatment.
Take a similar approach,

208
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:45,824
but with the mapping and confrontations 
ages being more fantasy lives and less 

209
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,110
laying on the couch talking about your 
mom,

210
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,213
but the connection we really wanted to 
make was to a pair of thinkers who were 

211
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,534
strongly opposed to Freud's method,
philosopher gl to lose and his 

212
00:11:58,871 --> 00:11:59,704
psychoanalyst sidekick Felix squats are 
the three things that got our spidey 

213
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,084
sense is tingling were one,
the use of the term arborization to 

214
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:10,060
describe the method they use to map the 
brain too.

215
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,480
There are bonds I trees everywhere and 
three,

216
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,403
the opening monologue suggests that the 
universe and life are a chaotic series 

217
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,753
of collisions for Dilas and watery.
The dominant way of thinking about the 

218
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,840
world is arborescent that is resembling 
a tree.

219
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,063
We often think about history and society
like a tree starting at a trunk and 

220
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:34,330
growing in a mostly linear fashion while
occasionally branching,

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,720
but the laws in Guata re preferred.
Another natural metaphor.

222
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,763
The rhizomes rhizomes are the roots of 
plants like ginger or weeds like 

223
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,384
dandelions.
The important thing about rhizomes is 

224
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:45,964
that they look like a series of 
connections with no visible starting 

225
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,010
point,
like say the roots of a tree.

226
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,173
Basically the world is too complex to be
understood linearly and instead of 

227
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,450
simple cause and effect,
there's inputs,

228
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,160
outputs,
feedback loops,

229
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,890
and a lot of chaos that we barely 
understand.

230
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,590
So why does this matter for maniac?
Well,

231
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:09,070
in some cases we could view the opening 
monologue under this framework.

232
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,203
Life isn't so much a straight line as it
is a chaotic assortment of random 

233
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,570
connections like the structure of a 
rhizome.

234
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,680
The crossing of wires for Owen and Andy 
kind of follow this logic,

235
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,573
the straight line of their computers.
Connections are interrupted by a random 

236
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:25,444
connection.
Bonsai trees in theory would be an 

237
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,503
interesting addition to the symbolism.
Not only is it defined by linearity and 

238
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:32,824
branching,
but that branching is intentionally 

239
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,340
guided by a human hand.

240
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,573
Maybe we could say that the show ends up
somewhere in the middle between being 

241
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,563
totally chaotic,
rhizome and the guided branching of the 

242
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:46,804
bonsai tree after all,
and he starts the show saying there is 

243
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,164
no plan or pattern to the universe.
It's just gas and ends the show saying 

244
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,670
this,
if this is assigned friend parks,

245
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,443
maybe the universe,
and we ultimately abandoned this idea 

246
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:02,344
because we couldn't find any evidence 
that linked the bonsai trees to the 

247
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,350
couple times that chaos versus order is 
referenced.

248
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,560
We had a few other clues to,
but they went nowhere.

249
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,020
For instance,
Dullas and quaternary are well known for

250
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,854
their Book Antietam,
which challenges people who sought to 

251
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,244
analyze the world in Freudian terms 
specifically they wanted to break free 

252
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,770
of the oedipal triangle.
Mommy,

253
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,710
Daddy,
and me and mantle ray after interpreting

254
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,440
his blindness as a symptom of his 
mother's behaviors,

255
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,393
rejects this Freud and framing and 
accepts that it was instead brought on 

256
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,320
by a kiss from a zoomy.

257
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,800
There's also this probably random 
coincidence,

258
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,280
felix squat to rewrote a screenplay 
called a love of you Iq,

259
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,143
which actually sounds kind of like ulp 
about a subatomic consciousness than 

260
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:52,381
inhabits a computer and falls in love 
with a human plus and watery use.

261
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,420
Schizophrenia as a model to think about 
the world where our desires.

262
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:01,250
We're not limited by the confines of 
society or say capitalism and yeah,

263
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,084
maniacs shows a kind of dystopian 
capitalism and there's a guy with 

264
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,950
schizophrenia,
but it doesn't quite work.

265
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,260
Pitch three.
Owens schizophrenia.

266
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,423
Yeah.
This one's the worst now opposed to the 

267
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,813
[inaudible] notion of schizophrenia,
which we need to say is not exactly 

268
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:16,994
literal to the medical condition.
There's Frederick Jameson's rebuttal to 

269
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:20,714
them.
Jamieson suggests that when people are 

270
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,084
so bombarded with commercial images and 
messages about who they can be or how a 

271
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,570
product will make them into this or that
person,

272
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,230
they're actually imposing competing 
ideas of identity onto them.

273
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,243
Therefore,
this causes a perpetually shifting 

274
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:40,760
identity or a schizophrenia subject and 
the more ones identity vacillates,

275
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,460
the more one consumes.
Therefore,

276
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:47,510
these schizophrenia subject is ideal for
such an economic system.

277
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,590
Mentees,
there's little doubt that the show hints

278
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:56,150
at a causal connection between advanced 
consumer capitalism and isolation,

279
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,163
but his maniac using Oh,
in schizophrenia as a metaphor for the 

280
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:02,930
ils heaped upon the denizens of the 
dystopia.

281
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,570
No,
definitely a stretch.

282
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,493
It's interesting,
but there's no evidence we could point 

283
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:09,254
to to make a confident case just because
we couldn't come up with a cogent 

284
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,860
argument about the shows.
Grander messages doesn't mean it isn't a

285
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:19,070
good show,
nor does it mean it isn't a smart show.

286
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,980
There are some extremely clever things 
going on.

287
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,053
The constant Easter egg references that 
connect the dreams not only to other 

288
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,890
dreams,
but to real life,

289
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,860
to focus on how narrative builds meaning
in our lives.

290
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,373
This makes sense and the small details 
at the end that make us question the 

291
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:42,920
validity of the real world above others.
Get it like when the the Lemur.

292
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,940
What makes maniacs so impressive is it's
daring visual aesthetic.

293
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,923
It's formless structure and it's regular
dips into absurdity and for that we 

294
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:52,574
can't help but admire it.
It sticks to a relatively simple 

295
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:56,174
thematic base and runs with it that 
people need connection and it's our 

296
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:03,440
ability to bond that can give us hope to
beat our demons.

297
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,783
That's all for now.

half baked format and as always,

we want to give a shout out to Wix,

place to host our main page,

307
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,910

create a temporary site so you can vote
