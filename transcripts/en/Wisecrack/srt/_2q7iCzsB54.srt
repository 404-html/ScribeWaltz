1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,613
Personally,

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,280
it's a very,
very complicated answer.

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,923
I think they should definitely be there 
as a last resort and probably for 

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,790
catastrophic health insurance,
but I think you know,

5
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,851
there's a question,
well,

6
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:31,520
should the government pay for 
healthcare?

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,110
And if you say yes to that and think you
solved the problem,

8
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:38,450
you haven't because the question 
becomes,

9
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,400
well,
how much healthcare should they pay for?

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,940
Should they pay for the 80 year old lady
who's a vegetable to stay alive?

11
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:49,550
Another six months?
Should they pay for the liver transplant

12
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:52,360
of the 40 year old alcoholic,
uh,

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,323
should they pay for the,
the operation on the guy who refused to 

14
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:58,784
wear his helmet and the motorcycle up?
Our resources are finite and we need to 

15
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,340
do a much better job of figuring out 
where we spend them in where we don't.

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,540
And right now we make a lot of these 
decisions opaquely.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,890
If you're black and poor,
chances are you're not going to get good

18
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,190
healthcare care if you're rich and 
white.

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,173
Even if you didn't pay your insurance,
chances are you know somebody who knows 

20
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,034
somebody at Mount Sinai,
so you're going to get better cancer 

21
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:27,434
operation.
You live in Iowa and there's a certain 

22
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:34,940
operation that might cure you,
but they offered only in Seattle,

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,193
you're probably not going to get that 
operation and we're never going to have 

24
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,334
a world of equality of outcome,
but we should at least have a world of 

25
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:49,451
equality of opportunity and we shouldn't
kid ourselves that.

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,730
Every life is infinitely more valuable 
than anything else.

27
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,060
We make trade offs all the time.
We.

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,363
We don't feed children right in school.
We we destroy lives much earlier than 

29
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,671
when they show up in the hospital and so
the problem is we don't like to confront

30
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:18,521
these decisions just as you might not 
like to confront decisions about that.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,150
I mentioned earlier that your personal 
life,

32
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:24,560
we as a society feel uncomfortable with 
explicit rules.

33
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,440
Yet those things get adjudicated all the
time.

34
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,663
Just quietly,
and I didn't really answer your 

35
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,464
question,
but I think at the at the day to day 

36
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:41,180
care,
people should pay their own costs,

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,960
but the.
The real issue is how it had to design a

38
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:45,794
system than incentivize healthy behavior
because most of the healthcare costs in 

39
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,284
this country are due to either end of 
life or what is essentially the results 

40
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,080
of bad behavior.
Uh,

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,300
heart disease,
lung cancer,

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,553
diabetes,
they're not assigned that you've been 

43
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:04,924
bad,
but they are aggravated by poor 

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,660
nutritional habits,
lack of exercise,

45
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:14,140
all these things.
And if we could just get people to adopt

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,350
much healthier lifestyles or medical 
costs will go down,

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,590
but I don't really want the government 
monitoring what people eat either.

48
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,690
So the challenge is how to change social
norms without brainwashing people,

49
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,660
let them understand their genetic 
information,

50
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,160
educate them better at school.

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,700
And I mean it really the,
the one that's,

52
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,693
you know,
Mcdonald's has a huge role to play in 

53
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:45,550
this just by what they offer people to 
eat.

54
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
If,
if the food companies could start 

55
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,343
promoting genuinely healthy food rather 
than kind of what does it truthiness 

56
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,303
fruitiness where you put chemicals into 
something and claim that it's more 

57
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,961
healthy because it has some kind of one 
piece of nutrition.

58
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:12,361
It's sort of like if you put please into
something saying that it's polite,

59
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,090
you know,
and the thing is still rude,

60
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,403
so it's,
it's extremely complicated and more 

61
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,644
information is a start more information 
about the impact of the kind of food we 

62
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,320
just as in the environment,
more information about the impact of the

63
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,380
kinds of things we drive or the stuff we
use or the cost of air conditioning,

64
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,074
that kind of thing.
