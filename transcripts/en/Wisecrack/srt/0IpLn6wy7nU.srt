1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,670
It's changed enormously.
Uh,

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,920
I'm in television was already the 
dominant factor when I came in,

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,990
but uh,
in 1960,

4
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:22,991
but there was a real sort of balance 
between print and television at that,

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,680
at that point,
under campaign buses,

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,903
the print reporters still sat up front 
and the television people sat in the 

7
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:35,480
back of the bus.
That changed pretty quickly.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,510
And now of course with cable,
uh,

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,770
uh,
both,

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,623
uh,
networks and the print our in the back 

11
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,320
seat and cable is driving the bus.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,210
It's a problem that is a kind of a 
artifact of the,

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,943
I think mostly the television,
a role as the dominant channel of 

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,640
communication for politicians.
What the politicians learned was that if

15
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:10,190
they maintain the old fashioned way of 
campaigning,

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,830
a set speeches,
complex tax on foreign policy or foreign

17
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:21,761
policy or economic policy,
that reporters had wide range as to what

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,300
they chose to report from those 
speeches.

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,750
But if they framed their message each 
day in a single sound byte,

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,030
particularly if they could do it in 
front of a dramatic setting,

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,300
a closed steel mill or a polluted 
stream,

22
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,710
that became the message for the 
television coverage.

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,783
And so with television you went,
you had essentially was a shrinkage of 

24
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:55,940
the daily message from the campaigns to 
that sound byte level.
