1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,390
What's up wise crack you've been asking 
for it and it's finally time.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,010
This week we're diving into the insanely
smart neon Genesis Evangelian.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,023
Ava is a phenomenally complex story on 
the surface it's about the end of the 

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,170
world and teenagers and enormous 
biomechanical monsters who fight giants,

5
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:20,004
alien Angel Robot Things,
but beneath that there's an 

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,590
investigation of psychosexual 
development,

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,543
intimacy,
unconscious human motivation and how 

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:32,400
hard it is to be a person,
but the real meat of everything is about

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,493
hedgehogs.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,403
Welcome to this wise crack addition on 
the philosophy of neon Genesis 

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,303
Evangelian but before we get to it,
we want to thank our sponsor blue apron

Thanks again the blue apron and onto 

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,080
evangelian and if you haven't seen it,
spoilers ahead.

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,500
Just a quick note,
even though the Ava reboot is beautiful,

34
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,550
we decided to keep our analysis to the 
original 26 episode series and the films

35
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:48,700
and have Evangelian and death and 
rebirth and if you like this,

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,760
maybe we'll come back for more.
So first a quick recap.

37
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,743
In the distant future of 2015 the earth 
is under attack by an earthly beings 

38
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,930
called angels.
In order to combat them.

39
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,853
Humanity has created ass kicking robots 
that sync with their pilots called 

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,430
Ava's.

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,750
Of course,
the evas aren't all day scenes.

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,693
They're actually former angels infused 
with the souls of humans inside the 

43
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,500
empty shell.
Bj Ba is a human.

44
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:14,650
Some specifically be mothers of the 
various pilots.

45
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,340
Shinji,
Ahsoka and ray who is a clone,

46
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,174
worked together to pilot the evas,
save the world and come to terms with 

47
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,620
their inner demons.
Oh,

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,790
also,
ray bonds,

49
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,624
the DNA of original angels,
Adam and Lilith becomes a being 

50
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:28,834
containing the consciousness of all 
humanity and pretends the end of 

51
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:32,170
existence.
But don't worry,

52
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,004
we'll cover that.
Do understand the ending of evangelic 

53
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,300
and we'd have to dive into some 
complicated ideas,

54
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,120
but I promise it'll be fun.
Part One,

55
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,103
as [inaudible] and mysticism,
neon genesis evangelian literally means 

56
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:48,400
a new beginning.
Neon is derived from the Greek neos,

57
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,234
which means new genesis is a beginning 
and a reference to the opening book of 

58
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:53,224
the Bible.
And Evangelican is the gospel or the 

59
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,600
good news from the same root as 
evangelize.

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,763
So neon genesis Evangelian is a new 
telling of the Gospel Genesis or the 

61
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,744
easy way.
It's a reimagining of the book of 

62
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,340
Genesis with lots of technology,
brooding and sex.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Ava is overflowing with religious 
iconography.

64
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,000
Some of the references are easy to spot.
The show references the Dead Sea scrolls

65
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:20,020
explicitly incidents not depicted in the
dead sea scrolls may occur.

66
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,093
This should teach the old metal lesson 
and Ritz go installs a six six six type 

67
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,680
firewall to protect the madge I from a 
cyber attack.

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,910
It cottey has installed a type six six 
six firewall on the Mount Joe's external

69
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,150
feeds surface.
That's very difficult to breach.

70
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,890
Not to mention the presence of creatures
called angels,

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,190
two of which are named Adam and Lilith.
You might've expected eve,

72
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:43,000
but Lilith is Adam's female counterpart.
According to Jewish folklore,

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,050
she was created around the same time as 
Adam and is usually described as being a

74
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,220
mother of Daemons.

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,233
You know,
evil in ava humans are the descendants 

76
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,144
of Louis.
Some of the religious work is Christian 

77
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,630
in nature.
The [inaudible] system.

78
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,840
The super computer network that runs 
nerve has three parts,

79
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,220
each named after the three wiseman.
Casper Alphas are Mlq or you know,

80
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:06,760
the guys that visited baby Jesus to give
him the gifts of gold and I Frankenstein

81
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,594
and Helen Mirren put the majority of the
religious imagery is based on Jewish 

82
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:14,740
mysticism and the Kabbalah.
Kabbalah is an investigative practice of

83
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,574
faith and mystical teachings at seeks 
religious revelation and sacred 

84
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,504
knowledge.
Some of its biggest fans are ancient 

85
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,904
rabbis and also Madonna.
Most of the angels and Ava are taken 

86
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,900
directly from techs and Judaism's 
extended universe like Zahar.

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,440
Essentially the Kabbalah is Bible,
the Talmud and the book of Enoch.

88
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,573
Others are written in El Theosophy,
a form of mystical riding that uses the 

89
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,863
El Suffix,
which is one of the many Hebrew words 

90
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,900
for God to tie names to the divine and 
it's all over Evangelian,

91
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,850
ramial Saatchi,
old material and Caladrius.

92
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,681
No,
sorry.

93
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,690
Scratch that one.
In cobblistic tradition,

94
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,290
the first being is Adam cadman.
Not to be confused with the other famous

95
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,000
Adam,
a being of light,

96
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,250
which is eerily similar to the giant of 
light.

97
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,630
That is Ava's first angel named Adam who
explodes in the second impact.

98
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,703
That's second impact,
kills half the population of the planet 

99
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,660
and turns the oceans read revelation 
style.

100
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,990
This destruction is a nother call back 
to the cabalistic tradition.

101
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,620
An event called the Chevron Tok Helene 
or the breaking of vessels.

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,410
See in the beginning,
everything was connected.

103
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,230
Part of a universal unity that broke 
apart,

104
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,250
leaving everything separate and creating
the many splintered world we live in.

105
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,780
It's sort of like a theological big bay.
The purpose of Kabbalah is to coon,

106
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:33,430
how long or the restoration of the world
it's traditionally practice through acts

107
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,264
of good deeds and prayer.
But in ava it's taken kind of literally 

108
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,350
the ethical call of the Kabbalah is the 
reunification of the world,

109
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,370
of the different fragmented parts of 
Adam call up the syfy road,

110
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,140
which is depicted as the tree of life as
10 circles in a particular pattern.

111
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,130
It creates a sort of visual tree that 
has meant to depict the tree of life.

112
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,520
It's why the random circles a pure 
around ava one when it's attacked by the

113
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,354
nine manufacturer angels,
they're all fulfilling the sacred duty 

114
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,260
or purpose of the Kabbalah.
The sephora roads re unifies everything.

115
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,243
Recreating the universe as a complete 
whole and in doing so destroys the 

116
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,720
individuality and separation that 
defines life as we know it.

117
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,920
Many characters pursue the goal of 
literally reunifying the world,

118
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,220
putting all the different 
consciousnesses into one place.

119
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,420
The industry who are bitching,
oh stage and our souls will be at peace.

120
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,380
This finally happens after the Adam 
Luleth DNA combined inside of Ray.

121
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,423
The reunification with the masculine and
feminine aspect of the angels is the 

122
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,744
reunification of the world as well.
This raises the question of why exactly 

123
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,544
the world needs to be reunited.
What does it mean for the world to be 

124
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,180
broken?

125
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,013
To answer that,
we need only to turn to our adorable 

126
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:56,060
friend the hedgehog and no,
not that one.

127
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,310
Part two,
the hedgehogs dilemma.

128
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,970
So much of Evangelian is eye candy,
sex,

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,980
big ass robots,
explosions,

130
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,750
more sex,
the apocalypse.

131
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,643
But it's at its most profound when the 
narrative dives into the crimson red 

132
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,900
lakes of sadness,
isolation,

133
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,290
and the human condition.
I'm seeing this for the first time,

134
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,124
and again,
this was the first time it pauses on 

135
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:19,994
empty streets on telephone poles where 
nothing scares the birds away and on 

136
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:27,200
classrooms with no students.
The world without half its population is

137
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,034
a sad place.
The end of himes isn't partying like 

138
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,394
it's 1999 it just sucks the characters,
miserable lives and intimacy problems 

139
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,890
can be explained by a hedgehog and the 
pre eminent philosophical pessimists,

140
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,813
Arthur schopenhauer in his book,
[inaudible] and perilite Hamina short 

141
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:46,760
philosophical essays,
volume to schopenhauer details,

142
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,633
a short parable that has become known as
the hedgehog or the porcupines dilemma 

143
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,543
in it's,
he explains the human condition by 

144
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:54,714
comparing humans.
Two hedgehogs huddled together for 

145
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,820
warmth,
though they crave warm,

146
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,000
hedgehogs can't get too close because of
their quills,

147
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,740
so they keep their distance and remain 
cold or learn to live without the warmth

148
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,380
of others.
So what does this have to do with ava?

149
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,790
Well,
everything.

150
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,893
The hedgehog is dilemma is Eva's guiding
theme in episode three Writ Sukkot 

151
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,080
explains the parable to mid Sato.
Do you know the fable,

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,993
the hedgehogs dilemma hedgehog?
You mean those animals with the spiny 

153
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:23,464
hair,
even though a hedgehog may want to 

154
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:27,820
become close with another hedgehog,
the closer they get,

155
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:29,800
the more they injure each other with 
their spines.

156
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,620
It's the same with some humans

157
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,790
and episode four it's even called the 
hedgehogs dilemma.

158
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,630
That desire to be unhurt drives a wedge 
between people.

159
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,280
It creates a world of despair.
We see that world and its implications.

160
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:47,280
In episode 16 titled Sickness Unto 
Death,

161
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,170
which is a reference to Danish 
philosopher,

162
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:52,680
Soren Kierkegaard.
A sickness unto death is despair.

163
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,543
Eight terrible existential loneliness 
which goes along with Schopenhauer is 

164
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,594
hedgehogs pretty neatly as does episode 
23 after Kaji is killed and he leaves a 

165
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,384
sad message on mid satos machine.
She remarks another phone that will 

166
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:09,990
never ring.
It's the epitome of lonesomeness waiting

167
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,824
for someone to reach out and call.
It's a depressing show filled with 

168
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,264
depressed people.
Ahsoka piles her ava to find meaning in 

169
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:18,930
life.
Without it.

170
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:22,170
She's just a sad girl crying in a dingy 
apartment.

171
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
We see in flashbacks that though she may
seem gruff,

172
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,500
she fears being alone and pilots or ava 
to draw people toward her and expand her

173
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:31,704
world.

174
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,883
There's Kendo who struggles with his 
ability to show Shinji love and doesn't 

175
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,980
know how to be a father when she,
she is near me.

176
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,060
All I ever do is causing pain.
When he's reunited with Youi,

177
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:50,150
he explains that I never deserved to be 
loved,

178
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,200
so he rejected the world so he wouldn't 
feel pain in his book.

179
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,034
The world as will and representation.
Schopenhauer argues that life is 

180
00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,054
suffering because the world is made up 
of will and representation for 

181
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,390
Schopenhauer.
The nature of reality is unity.

182
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,403
We'd all be at peace without this 
struggle to communicate between 

183
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:09,884
individuals.
Suffering is the result of 

184
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,344
individuality.
To be human is to suffer because 

185
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:17,840
communication,
perception and understanding we'll never

186
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:21,860
be perfect and that struggled to connect
is the source of our suffering.

187
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,220
The Universe is really one thing in 
itself,

188
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,180
one entity,
but each individual will or ego can only

189
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:32,390
perceive the world from its own vantage 
point or perception.

190
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,870
That's what schopenhauer means.
When he says representation,

191
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,940
anguish,
fragmentation,

192
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:38,774
alienation and isolation are all because
each person is in charge of their will 

193
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,720
and there is a disconnect between what 
we desire and what the world gives us,

194
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,310
which is echoed by cohorts.

195
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,700
This is mankind's fake.
If human hope,

196
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:54,440
this fun with the flex or Solano,

197
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,300
that's separation of wills is what the 
show calls a tea fields,

198
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,500
which are something like the unique 
human soul that's separate each person's

199
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,080
ego.
It's sort of their life force.

200
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,410
The barrier that keeps us from truly 
connecting to each other.

201
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,453
Several times characters have 
conversations about what it means to be 

202
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,754
an ego and to have a body usually as 
their body or consciousness is slipping 

203
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:20,800
away.
Ray does this in episodes 14 and 23 both

204
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:21,634
exchanges are reflections on what it 
means to be a human being that has a 

205
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,340
body and is recognized by others.

206
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,140
You're right at the core,
we are all the same.

207
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,063
Our minds lack something basic and we 
fear that lack and that is why we are 

208
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:39,200
attempting to become one.
We will meld with and fill each other.

209
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,483
This is the instrumentalities.
Mankind cannot live without being 

210
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:46,550
surrounded by others.
Mankind cannot live alone,

211
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,450
although you yourself are always unique.
That is why life is hard.

212
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,463
That is why life is sad and empty cause 
want to close physical and mental 

213
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,280
preference of others.
That is why we wish to me come on.

214
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,080
This struggle with isolation and the 
pain of rejection defines ava.

215
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,063
Unfortunately as schopenhauer tells us,
being alive means living with will and 

216
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:07,834
ego and that means pain that drive to 
get away from this pain and ego is 

217
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:15,550
something that we can explain what the 
help of our cocaine addled friend,

218
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,650
Doctor Freud,
part three psycho analysis.

219
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,653
I know people are mad because Freud is 
considered a hack and didn't science 

220
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,430
hard enough.
I get it but hey,

221
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,990
eva explicitly uses 40 in terms ideas 
and analysis.

222
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,883
Episode 19 is called Trajection,
a 40 in term that explains how people 

223
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,130
take on characteristics of the people 
around them.

224
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,263
You know copycats.
Episode 20 is called weaving a story to 

225
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,313
oral stage.
The oral stage corresponds to the 

226
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,330
weaning of a child from breastfeeding.
According to Freud,

227
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,193
when a child too soon and they're out of
touch with people's emotions and are 

228
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:53,380
generally sociopathic,
wean them too late and they're dependent

229
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:57,010
too long on the mother for security and 
end up neurotic Mama's boys.

230
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,650
Kind of like that.
Robin Aaron Kid from game of thrones.

231
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,663
All the kids in Ava's pilot classes are 
motherless children or so they think in 

232
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,954
fact Shinji.
His mom is unit one soul and part of 

233
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,950
Asa.
His mother's soul is in unit two.

234
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,240
Both Ava's use the soul's inside them to
further bond with their pilots.

235
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,050
How the pilot reacts to their mother is 
indicative of their general disposition.

236
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,440
It's as 40 and is it can get there all 
morning.

237
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,950
The last love object that is their 
mother except ray,

238
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:28,951
is less mournful and more melancholic 
because she has no soul as an artificial

239
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:32,530
being.
She has no real loss to speak of no mama

240
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,290
soul to snatch and put in a robot.
For Freud.

241
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,780
Mourning happens when we know what we 
have lost.

242
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,780
Melancholy on the other hand is much 
more serious.

243
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,690
It occurs when people have no idea 
what's missing.

244
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,690
Only that it causes them deep,
deep sadness,

245
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,673
hence the need for psychotherapy.
That's why the last two episodes of the 

246
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:54,100
show are literally a psychotherapy 
session inside Shinji his mind,

247
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,380
but if you depend only on the ava,
Ava will become your only identifier.

248
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,730
April will become your own lead value.
Without that value you the wheel,

249
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:04,710
you will be erased from this existence.

250
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,150
We mentioned the manager I super 
computers before,

251
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:07,984
but we didn't tell you that they have 
the mind of Dr Naoko Akagi imprinted in 

252
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,124
them.
They are reflective of the tripartite 

253
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:17,170
model of the human unconscious,
the controlling scientist as the ego,

254
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,093
the mother as the punishing and guilt 
inducing superego and the woman as the 

255
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,180
sexual in episode 18 is titled 
Ambivalence.

256
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,043
A Freudian idea that eva really leans 
into and bill mullins is the way that 

257
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,740
people can passionately hate and love.
At the same time,

258
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,530
like when I eat chipolte lake for 
example,

259
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,010
Shinji is constantly talking about how 
much he hates his father.

260
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,230
However,
I really hated my father,

261
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,730
yet he gets in the ava over and over to 
make daddy proud.

262
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,743
In episode 12 he explains,
he pilots the ava to hear words of 

263
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:49,140
praise from his dad.

264
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,153
I think I finally understood the part 
about being praised by someone when I 

265
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,584
heard my father's words today,
and I also realized that the reason I 

266
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:02,360
pilot my ava is to hear those words from
him.

267
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,690
He runs away from his dad nerve and his 
responsibilities as an ava pilot,

268
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,610
but he keeps coming back.

269
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,600
I must've grown away.
I must've run away.

270
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,070
The real smart stuff he's done with 
arrows and thanatos or the drive to life

271
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,300
and the death drive for Freud beings are
instilled with the pleasure principal,

272
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,840
the general inclination to avoid pain 
and maximize pleasure.

273
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,883
So in episode 16 when Shinji falls into 
the direct C or a pocket universe 

274
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,630
elements,
yeah,

275
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,900
this world is filled with too much pain 
and suffering to keep going on.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,670
He's expressing his desire to minimize 
suffering.

277
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,650
As it pertains to the pleasure 
principle,

278
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,040
this struggle to avoid pain is aligned 
with schopenhauer.

279
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,874
His ideas about will and struggle.
How can we ever avoid suffering when we 

280
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:46,864
have to share a world with other people,
all of whom have their own desires that 

281
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:50,914
sometimes get in the way of ours?
How do we find peace for sale a nerve 

282
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:57,280
and even individuals like Gando in 
Shinji?

283
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,560
It all comes back to 
instrumentalization.

284
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,603
The process by which all human 
consciousness is combined into a 

285
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:03,994
primordial soup called lcl.
That desire to join a unified whole and 

286
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:08,914
no longer be concerned with issues of 
the self comes up in Freud to it's 

287
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,550
called the death drive.
The death drive is a desire to return to

288
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:18,550
tranquility,
to the peace and harmony of the womb,

289
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,900
and what can be more peaceful than the 
end of every once it's gone.

290
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,763
There's nothing to worry about.
Episode 25 has a direct call to this 

291
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:29,710
with the text.
The case of Shinji Akari,

292
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,723
the boy who wished for death of his own 
will then Kendo in the mind of Shinji 

293
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,890
states that instrumentality.
Yeah.

294
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,763
It's not a return to nothingness.
It is merely a return to a state of 

295
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:40,724
beginning.
It is no less than a return to the 

296
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,394
primal wound that we'd lost so long ago.
Souls and minds will become one 

297
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,290
attaining internal balance.

298
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,443
Oh,
return to Lilith and to coon hall along 

299
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,240
the restoration of the world or the 
reunification with the primordial being.

300
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,313
And so salian nerve are working for the 
death drive and they count on Shinji to 

301
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:00,664
become the arc for humanity,
that which will allow them to return to 

302
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:06,190
a world without loneliness and 
isolation.

303
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,323
Conclusion.
So the human reaction to the hedgehogs 

304
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:12,250
dilemma is to seek tranquility and a 
return to the womb.

305
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,640
But as we've seen,
that's simply a desire for death,

306
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,460
a running away.
So what has to be done?

307
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,533
Well,
it's Kaworu a character who is not 

308
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:22,294
entirely human,
that shows us the way accepting 

309
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:25,504
vulnerability Kaworu gives up his 
individual desires and we'll so that 

310
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:29,794
Shinji can live.
He is unguarded and open with his 

311
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,243
absolute love for Shinji.
He represents a way out of the cycle of 

312
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,840
constant suffering and isolation.
And he just gives damn good advice.

313
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,500
I know that by keeping others at a 
distance,

314
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,513
you avoid a betrayal of your trust.
For a while you may not be hurt that 

315
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,774
way.
You mustn't that you must endure the 

316
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,684
loneliness.
Men cannot erase this sentence because 

317
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:55,944
the owner fundamentally pain is 
something that man must endure in his 

318
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:04,980
hard and since the heart feels pain so 
easily,

319
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,780
some believe life is pain.

320
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,763
In the final episodes and the movie 
chinchy initially accepts 

321
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,754
instrumentalization,
but when he understands just what he'd 

322
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,430
lose himself,
he has a change of heart.

323
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,740
Your self image is restrained by having 
to observe the barriers between yourself

324
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,633
and others.
You cannot see yourself without the 

325
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,830
presence of awesome because there were 
others.

326
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,740
I can perceive myself as an individual.
If I'm alone,

327
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,890
then I will be the same without others.
For this world is only of me,

328
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,020
then there will be no difference between
me and nothing.

329
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,080
At the end of the series,
Shinji rejects instrumentality.

330
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,140
Hi me,
I want to be myself.

331
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,290
I want to continue existing in this 
world

332
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,070
mount as a world where everyone is 
primordial soup and shares one mind.

333
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,250
What is this empty space?
An empty world,

334
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,100
a world where nothing exists with 
myself,

335
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,610
but with only my Silva.
I have nothing to interact with.

336
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,043
It's as if I'm here but not here at all.
It's just if I'm slowly fading out of 

337
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:05,874
existence,

338
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,740
he ops for one where people can be hurt.
Where we are in close,

339
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,723
where there is a separation and 
individual selves where there are 

340
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,690
individuals,
wheels,

341
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,583
desires and pain.
He confronts the drive to inorganic 

342
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:23,040
existence and accepts the inevitability 
of suffering in life.

343
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,480
That's correct.
If the pain is too harsh,

344
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,140
you can escape it.
If you really hated changing style.

345
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,100
No,
I won't.

346
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,460
I'm tired of escaping a little money,

347
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,880
but he also opens the door for hope and 
joy.

348
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,790
So the first thing he does when he 
rejects instrumentality,

349
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,650
he turns over and chokes Ahsoka.
She responds by stroking his face,

350
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,550
reminding us that the world they chose 
is one of violence and pain,

351
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,060
but also love all three elements of the 
story.

352
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,073
The theological,
psychological and philosophical deal 

353
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,480
with something called lack in 
psychology,

354
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,530
lack as explored by the Freud inspired 
psycho analysis and philosophers.

355
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:08,370
Jacques Lacan is the missing center at 
the heart of our existence,

356
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,180
the missing piece between representation
and the world in itself,

357
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,820
whether it be a scarcity of friends,
failing,

358
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:18,330
marriages and relationships or distance 
between father and son.

359
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,373
Eva is able to consistently weave,
applaud that delves deep into the 

360
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:25,830
visceral reality of humanities,
disappointing existence.

361
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,600
Three pilots,
Ray,

362
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,434
the Japanese word for soul,
ghost not or zero in unit zero Shinji 

363
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,560
the pilot of unit number one.

364
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,290
The first real person introduced the 
other,

365
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,790
the pilot of unit number two,
a girl a call back to the expulsion from

366
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,640
Eden,
the world of infinite knowledge and life

367
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,820
in the end it's just asa and Shinji,
a new Adam and eve,

368
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,833
a new beginning.

Hovering anime has been a really awesome
experience for us since the stuff that 

375
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:14,370
is popular is actually really profound.
So my favorite videos aren't anime,

376
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,213
like our episodes on death note attack 
on Titan and full metal alchemist 

377
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:19,990
brotherhood,
which that last one might actually be my

378
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:20,824
favorite video.
