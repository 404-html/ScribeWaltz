1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,480
Play the one case that everybody has 
held,

2
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:11,314
the speculator and people have watched 
the process and operation has been the 

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,044
Floyd Landis case,
the cyclist where the two different 

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:24,561
approaches for detecting testosterone 
abuse suggested that an abuse occurred.

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,390
They two tasks are totally different 
approaches.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,733
Both came up with the same result.
He's challenged that and there's one of 

7
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,714
the challenges actually the challenge is
work up the chain of command if you 

8
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,654
will.
And I went to the United States Anti 

9
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,690
Doping Agency and uh,
the,

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,510
the tribunals that looked at that 
particular case of experts,

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,773
uh,
concluded that there was a doping 

12
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,164
violation.
And I believe he's taking this to the 

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,880
Court of Arbitration and Sport,
which is the last stop.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,150
Uh,
but it was a interesting,

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,090
uh,
experience for the,

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,290
because people watched how complicated 
this all is.

17
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,124
And I,
that's probably at the bottom line of 

18
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:12,954
what I want to say here is how 
complicated and sophisticated this all 

19
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:17,580
is.

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,550
This is,
uh,

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,760
this is not just taking a pill.
Uh,

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,770
the science is very demanding.
Uh,

23
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,950
the adjudication process is very 
demanding.

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,530
Uh,
there's a lot of stake here.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,580
Uh,
and the only way it seems to me this was

26
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,414
able to be dealt with.
It's still institutionalized the whole 

27
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,120
process.
And that's really how water was born,

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,570
whether it was the laboratories,
the collection of specimens,

29
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,960
the handing out of sanctions is 
developing the list,

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,580
the concept of therapeutic use 
exemptions,

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,170
which we should talk about.
Uh,

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,490
there are so many different elements to 
this,

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,920
uh,
that,

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,423
uh,
soundbite critiques of doping really 

35
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,544
don't do justice to the evolution of the
end of doping movement over the last 

36
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,094
eight or nine

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,710
[inaudible].
