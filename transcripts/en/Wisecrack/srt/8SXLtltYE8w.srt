What's up wise?

2
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:06,674
Crack Jared again.
Today we're covering the only show 

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,430
guaranteed to traumatize you in its 
first 10 minutes.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,080
Goblin slayer.
Now,

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:13,914
while much of the conversation 
surrounding the show focuses on that 

6
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:16,824
notorious scene that we're all aware of,
there's something else going on that is 

7
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:23,040
a really interesting development for the
fantasy genre and it all revolves around

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,874
the question,
why does Goblin slayer only killed 

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,680
goblins?
And how does that form the shows greater

10
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,640
message?
Well,

11
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,474
let's bathe in Goblin blood and go deep 
in this wise crack condition on Goblin 

12
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,160
slayer.
And as always,

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,130
spoilers ahead.
Let's kick it off with a quick recap,

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,550
a bright eyed priestess.
No one has real names in this show.

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,980
And friends set out on their first 
adventure,

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,230
eager to kill goblins.
But uh,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,030
things go wrong,
very,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,043
very wrong for friends die.
But Goblin slayer rescues her in the 

19
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,794
nick of time.
She joins his party and becomes his 

20
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,404
Goblin slaying paddle won.
Their party grows when an Elf dwarf and 

21
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,304
Lizard man joined them to investigate 
some particularly worrisome goblins on 

22
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,084
the border.
Then they head off to kill even more 

23
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,060
sewer,
goblins,

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,193
all the while a demon lord is 
threatening the realm and our hero 

25
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,520
seriously does not care.

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,480
Niac the whole damn damn.
Oh Shit.

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,290
That's a good example.
Is Key.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,380
The God,
so today.

29
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,703
Cool,
cool.

30
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,550
Go.
But he like you and I.

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,850
Why?

32
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,720
Well,
sure.

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,600
There's actual narrative reasons they 
killed his sister.

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Well,
can you about gun Greece,

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,560
but because we like to get Metta,
we wanted to address this question as it

36
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,810
pertains to the genre that the show is 
playing.

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,490
Fantasy.
Okay.

38
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,480
Yeah.
It's animated,

39
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,900
but the show is pretty heavy on 
references to d and D.

40
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,510
There's the dice rolling spell slots,
guilds,

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,583
quests,
and a hodgepodge of other fantasy 

42
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:00,520
tropes.
The show relishes in the generics of the

43
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,760
fantasy genre.
Characters and places have intentionally

44
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,970
generic names as the show prefers labels
like Elvin,

45
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:07,804
ranger watertown or sword maiden.
Even big bosses get nomenclatures like 

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,693
Goblin champion or demon Lord.
So let's talk about generic fantasy and 

47
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,170
novels.
Tabletop games or MMOS heroes start with

48
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,850
the small stuff.
Rats,

49
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,020
bugs,
goblins.

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,033
They grind through these small 
challenges until they're ready to take 

51
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,330
on stronger and more interesting 
enemies,

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,790
but then some horrifying villain emerges
and threatens the world as you know it.

53
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,490
The story starts with small problems and
builds to a big one,

54
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,690
and once that big one is slane,
then things can go back to being peg.

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,990
Goblin slayer steps off that linear path
with a resounding,

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,973
you know what?
I'd rather just kill goblins things you 

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,813
rationalize.
This is choice when his compatriots try 

58
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,230
to get them to care about more pressing 
matters.

59
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,100
Do you know about the globe edema,
moodle multiples?

60
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,180
You

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,310
know,
Chemo Goulburn,

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,650
and we'll meet over to you and you know.

63
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,783
See even if the demon Lord dies,
the Goblin slayer argues goblins will 

64
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,400
still terrorize rural and vulnerable 
areas.

65
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,910
By having our protagonists phobia,
saul on the little guys of sorts,

66
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,520
goblins,
player subverts the basic assumptions of

67
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,550
the fantasy genre,
namely the happily ever after.

68
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,130
Do things go back to normal.
When we've murdered,

69
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,040
the big bad guy has the hero achieved 
peace,

70
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,790
not quite eight litany of less 
spectacular monster.

71
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,790
Still plague the villagers in the most 
recent episode.

72
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,624
The Demon Lords death confirms this 
while the constant reference to the 

73
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,314
demon Lord earlier in the season would 
normally foreshadows some kind of 

74
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:42,961
climactic end of seasons showdown.
So he just say the opposite happens.

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,613
The demon Lord is dispatched in under a 
minute by some random heroes that we 

76
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,574
neither know nor care about,
and instead of suggesting some happily 

77
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:54,580
ever after where instead reminded of 
these words from the sword maiden

78
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,730
say the school.
Cool.

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,050
So can you pick a Canadian?

80
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,160
We can better understand Goblin slayers 
logic.

81
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,023
What's something called theory,
which is pretty much exactly what it 

82
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,680
sounds like.
It asks,

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,633
what exactly is piece one theorist John 
Dalton draws a distinction between two 

84
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,750
kinds of peace,
positive and negative.

85
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,883
Negative peace is the absence of war.
It's the kind of piece you're used to 

86
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:36,060
talking about the end of World War II or
the Vietnam war or the civil war.

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,193
You get it in the fantasy genre.
We can think of it as the absence of 

88
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:40,794
night canes or sour on organic door I e 
o world without the demon lords 

89
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:46,044
destroying the world as we know it.
That's fine and Dandy for peace 

90
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,150
theorists,
but it doesn't examine these smaller and

91
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:51,984
often more pervasive violence that 
affects society's most vulnerable 

92
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,380
people.

93
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,380
Do I need my job?
Big Deal.

94
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,543
That's where positive piece comes in.
Positive piece is the presence of 

95
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:08,280
justice and protections that serve the 
needs of everyone,

96
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,860
more or less what Goblin slayer is 
after,

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,740
while on the show,
it's simply goblins in the real world.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,980
It can be a litany of this poverty,
famine,

99
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,360
disease,
corruption,

100
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,710
discrimination,
crime,

101
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:22,170
and so on.
The goblins of the real world,

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,790
if you will,
positive piece.

103
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,700
It's especially important for our 
understanding of violence.

104
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,623
For many folks,
violence is an interruption to daily 

105
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:30,114
life,
but for some it's the backdrop against 

106
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:33,770
which life takes place.
Goblins,

107
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,780
slayer can't just chill it.
An idyllic farm with cowgirl,

108
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:37,614
which is really what they call her 
without searching for signs of goblins 

109
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:40,944
and fortifying defenses.
Unlike the platinum heroes that killed 

110
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,514
the demon.
Lord.

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,940
In goblin flavors,
view the shape of the world.

112
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:53,774
Guarantees that people are on.
Farms will always face gallbladder 

113
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,304
attacks.
That's why goblins slayer doesn't care 

114
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,660
about the demon.
Lord,

115
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,670
he's busy burning down Goblin this now 
that may not seem very peaceful and it's

116
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,504
not,
but it's a question of conflict 

117
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,394
prevention and development,
so simply by taking care of the Goblin 

118
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:10,844
problem in the short term,
Goblin slayer starts the process of 

119
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,114
longterm protection,
but it's not just that smaller issues 

120
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:19,670
can compound to create an equally crappy
reality.

121
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,504
For many,
the kind of small work that needs to be 

122
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,114
done is balked at it's grunt work.
Everyone wants the glory of killing the 

123
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,970
demon Lord,
but chopping goblins.

124
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,150
That's child's play.
Even when the demon Lord is gone,

125
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,670
the clean up of his armies is below some
people

126
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,270
ada,
he needed to eat all my money.

127
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,980
I told him,
boy,

128
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,480
he doesn't.
So no,

129
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,423
despite being a silver class adventure 
or Goblin slayer is marked for his 

130
00:06:55,311 --> 00:07:00,311
choice of missions in the hierarchy of 
adventuring.

131
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,980
He's like if general patent started 
cleaning latrines,

132
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,933
but in the world of Goblin slayer,
toilets are going uncleaned because 

133
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,024
nobody wants to be the janitor,
and without clean toilets we might just 

134
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,610
all die from Colorado,
so somebody has to do that work.

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,860
We can see this sort of thing all over 
the place.

136
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:18,560
In real life.
People take jobs that get all the glory,

137
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,483
so doctors researching cancer get all 
the press while doctors doing routine 

138
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:26,810
work to test the water to prevent 
equally deadly stomach illnesses.

139
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,190
Well,
not so much.

140
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,143
People take jobs that are high paying 
and high prestigious without much 

141
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,650
thought for what?
As the highest social impact.

142
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,260
Even in sports,
everyone wants to be the quarterback.

143
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,840
Nobody wants to be whatever a left 
tackle is.

144
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,570
Goblins.
Slayer wanted to kill dragons as a child

145
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,404
and it's not until he sees the dangers 
of goblins firsthand that he commits 

146
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:50,110
himself to his mission.
You would just sit and look at q three,

147
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Twenty Coca Cola soda still weeks.
Now,

148
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,680
this is an even bigger problem than it 
seems for two reasons.

149
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,783
First,
the stigma against Goblin slang causes 

150
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:05,910
many to minimize the threat goblins 
pose.

151
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,173
Slaying Goblins isn't complicated.
You mostly swing swords around and cut 

152
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,280
off heads.
They can even apparently get killed by a

153
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,570
strong kick.
Now,

154
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,750
that doesn't mean it's easy as we see 
throughout the show,

155
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,584
goblins have tricks of their own that 
can make them very dangerous when 

156
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,810
they're perceived as a simple problem.
However,

157
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,853
the people sent to deal with the issue 
are not qualified because aside from 

158
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,874
Goblin slayer,
civil ranked heroes have quote better 

159
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:34,784
things to do,

160
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,630
quarter to sunken meadow bogus I with 
them in it,

161
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,740
and that's how you ended up with 
situations like this,

162
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,760
so unqualified heroes get murdered and 
the goblins stick around.

163
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,910
That sucks,
which leads us to our second issue.

164
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,580
The problem worsens as the goblins breed
and become even more dangerous,

165
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,683
worse yet,
major heroes don't want to get involved 

166
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:06,060
because they think goblins are nothing 
but pes or they don't want to admit that

167
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:06,894
goblins or a real threat because it 
would be embarrassing to say so enter 

168
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,990
the sword.
Maybe she is the ass kicking.

169
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:13,824
Super leader of priestesses religion.
She even slayed the original demon Lord 

170
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,480
with her big awesome sword.

171
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,190
Is there a name?

172
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,720
She hires Goblins,
slayer and his friends to deal with some

173
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,200
goblins under the city who are 
presumably responsible for some murders,

174
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,213
but soon becomes obvious that she 
herself committed some light murder to 

175
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,440
have the goblins taken care of by 
someone else.

176
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,100
That's good.
That's good.

177
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,440
I could assign a top

178
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,483
because she was afraid after her own 
traumatic running and admitting that 

179
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:48,920
you're afraid of goblins after defeating
a demon.

180
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,070
Lord is definitely against the unspoken 
hero code.

181
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,360
Goblin attacks can leave people in a 
constant state of fear and anxiety.

182
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,480
Those feelings contribute to an already 
difficult life for many,

183
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:02,540
and that again raises the stakes of 
positive piece.

184
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,440
Dealing with goblins doesn't necessarily
change the material conditions of life,

185
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:09,710
but definitely the psychological ones,
goblins slayers.

186
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,544
Intervention to kill the goblins and 
talked to the sword maiden about her 

187
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:15,620
fears has a substantial effect on her 
wellbeing.

188
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,110
She no longer has goblin nightmares.

189
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,820
You mainly use English 30 minutes.

190
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,930
What's so interesting about this take on
fantasy is what we can expect it will do

191
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,430
to the narrative.
Normally,

192
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,280
as the series goes on,
the threads get bigger and scarier.

193
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,413
We even see this in standalone episodes 
when we start off with regular goblins 

194
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,760
and then the conflict escalates to an 
ogre,

195
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,000
but since the demon Lord has already 
gotten snowed ears,

196
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,860
your toes and the goblins slayers and 
10th on only slaying goblins.

197
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,190
What creative ways will they come up 
with to up the stakes?

198
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,233
Perhaps we'll see more ambiguity 
regarding the Goblin threat with this 

199
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,460
false sense of security taking hold 
across the land.

200
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,730
The goblin problem will probably remain 
in obscurity for most,

201
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,770
but as we saw at the end of the last 
episode,

202
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,680
it's about to hit Goblin slayer much 
closer to home.

203
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,723
So is the story.
You're gonna stay on Goblins or are we 

204
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,530
cruising toward a collision with 
something?

205
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,690
Sure and batter.
