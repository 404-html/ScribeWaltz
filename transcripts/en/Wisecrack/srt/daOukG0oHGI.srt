1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,743
What's up guys,
jared here on the set of one of our 

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,670
other projects,
so infinity war is finally out.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,190
We saw it and wanted to try something 
new,

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,610
whereas we usually dive into the themes,
ideologies,

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:18,720
and subtexts of these films to gain a 
better appreciation for them today.

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,554
We're going to use these elements to 
propose some educated predictions of 

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,890
what will happen in a vendors for so 
welcome to this wise crack quick take on

8
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,210
infinity war,
part one.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,930
Spoilers ahead for part one,
and if we're flattering ourselves,

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,764
part two.
Also a huge things to digital sputnik 

11
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,064
for supplying us with their gear to make
these quick takes and all of our other 

12
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:38,754
shoots look pretty awesome.
They make it so easy to just throw up 

13
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:41,904
some lights and shoot.
So thanks again to digital sputnik for 

14
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,770
making lighting fun for us.
Now on with the quick take,

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,903
the central question of infinity war is 
whether the value of an individual life 

16
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:54,420
can be weighed against the greater good 
throughout the film.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,253
Characters are posed with the conundrum 
should they sacrifice a loved one for 

18
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,840
the greater good at the films climax 
scarlet,

19
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,740
which attempts to kill vision for lover 
in order to destroy the mind stone.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,753
Similarly,
quill reluctantly tries to shoot 

21
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:08,064
Gomorrah,
his lover only for his blast to turn 

22
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,094
into bubbles and later thanos throws her
off the altar on for me or as a 

23
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:15,184
sacrifice to earn the soul stone.
This is one of moral philosophies all 

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,130
time.
Classic debates,

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,220
one that we've talked about before,
utilitarian,

26
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:27,210
consequentialism versus deontology.
To briefly summarize,

27
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,044
utilitarian.
Consequentialism defines actions as 

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,310
ethical if they achieve a positive 
outcome for them.

29
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:34,144
Most people,
no matter what one must do to achieve 

30
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:38,880
those ends.
Deontology on the other hand,

31
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,743
is a duty based ethic that suggests that
no outcomes can justify heinous things 

32
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,620
like murder.
I'm going to neutralize a lot of threats

33
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,550
before they even happen.

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,830
That's punishment usually came after the
crime,

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,180
scarlet witch,
star,

36
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,670
Lord,
and then I was all ultimately make their

37
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:57,180
moral decisions based on consequences 
instead of duties.

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,850
For everyone that's not a rip off of 
dark side.

39
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,160
This greater good is fairly 
straightforward.

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,750
Do anything to stop Vanos from gathering
all the infinity mcgovern's.

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,823
It's basically trolley problem,
the movie you are arriving a trolley 

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,803
when the brakes fail and on the track 
ahead of you are five workman that you 

43
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:22,221
will run over.
Now you can steer to another track,

44
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,250
but on that track is one person you 
would kill instead of the five.

45
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,390
The mad titans understanding of good is 
a universe in perfect balance,

46
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,613
firstly,
balance between life and death and 

47
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,480
secondly balanced between humans and 
resources.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,433
This second one echoes the economic 
philosophies of Thomas Robert Malthus 

49
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,560
who suggested that when you have finite 
resources,

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,480
you therefore have an ideal population 
size and when you exceed that population

51
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,300
size,
poverty and starvation increase,

52
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,343
but ultimately the film is critical of 
anyone who tries to use math to measure 

53
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:56,904
the word of some lives against others,
these sacrifices and never actually 

54
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,770
succeed in bringing about the greater 
good.

55
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Their actions are at best few tile and 
at worst maximally evil star,

56
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,034
Lord and scarlet witch is attempts to 
sacrifice their loved ones are thwarted 

57
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:15,670
by Thanos and fall apart.
In a matter of moments.

58
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,510
We see this critique again when at the 
beginning Dr.

59
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,443
strange says he won't hesitate to let 
Tony or Peter die to protect the 

60
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,823
timestamp.
This changes when at the end he reneged 

61
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,343
and trades the time stone for Tony's 
life in recognition of a higher moral 

62
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,714
duty.
This is best articulated in captain 

63
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:37,450
America is constant refrain.
We don't trade lives basically,

64
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,530
if you ever want to know what the film's
regard as right look no further than the

65
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,170
mcu is moral exemplar.
Steve Rogers.

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,153
So what does the films moral perspective
tell us about what will happen in 

67
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,720
avengers four.
To answer that,

68
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,583
let's take a look at the comic run that 
inspired infinity war even more than 

69
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,260
Jim's Darwin's Infinity Gauntlet mini 
series.

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,153
We're talking of course about Jonathan 
Hickman's epic marble run that weaves 

71
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,640
its way through fantastic for future 
foundation of vendors,

72
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,930
new avengers,
infinity,

73
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,823
and secret wars.
This is the run that it introduced the 

74
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,860
coal obsidian outriders and the battle 
of will conda from the film's finale,

75
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,260
but most importantly,
infinitely wars.

76
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,750
Moral philosophy is ripped right from 
Hickman.

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,060
If you thought the stakes were high in 
this movie,

78
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,630
check this.
An infinite number of parallel universes

79
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,464
were colliding together at the point of 
earth threatening to annihilate their 

80
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,253
trillions of inhabitants.
The only way to prevent this was to 

81
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:33,670
destroy one of the Earth's along with 
the billions of people living on it,

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,833
or to put it another way,
killing millions to say it was the 

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,023
ultimate trolley problem with all of 
existence tied to the tracks and heroes 

84
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,074
like iron man and Black Panther forced 
to grapple with whether or not to pull 

85
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,064
the lever in a moment of truth for all 
involved to child walks right up to the 

86
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,010
moral line before refusing to cross it.

87
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,620
I know I should.
I know I must,

88
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,454
but it's wrong.
We were damned the very day we thought 

89
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,940
it was for men to decide things such as 
this as always,

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,803
it's captain America who most clearly 
champions duty based morality that like 

91
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,240
roar shack is utterly uncompromising.
Even in the face of Armageddon,

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,313
I don't let people die because it's the 
lesser of two evils or expedient or 

93
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,364
because it serves the greater good.
I don't compare the act against 

94
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,400
something else.
I see someone who needs help and I help.

95
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,220
I don't measure people's lives.
I saved them,

96
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,330
but perhaps the ultimate exemplar of 
duty based doing what is right,

97
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,720
ethics and Hickman's work is Mr.
fantastic himself,

98
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,703
Reed Richards,
and it's his arch that will be most 

99
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,890
telling for how avengers four will 
conclude in secret wars Dr.

100
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,813
Doom like fantasies with the infinity 
gauntlet has become for all intensive 

101
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,560
purposes,
God,

102
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,310
but he's not defeated by force or a 
clever plan,

103
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,460
but by recognition that reed is a 
genuinely,

104
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:58,340
morally superior man who would have been
at being God.

105
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,490
This is Hickman's main thesis and one we
think will play out in avengers for one,

106
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,730
ought not way lives and calculate how to
achieve the greatest good,

107
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,060
but instead merely act according to 
one's duty.

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,480
So here are our predictions for avengers
for one fan.

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,790
I won't be able to enjoy that sunset at 
the end of the movie quite as much as he

110
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,624
had hoped.
His regret over Gomorrah's death will 

111
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:27,110
convince him that a single life can have
irreducible worth even one way against a

112
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,870
world in which everyone enjoys peace and
plenty,

113
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,670
which obviously they won't.

114
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,120
It was still a stupid,
stupid,

115
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,330
stupid,
stupid,

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,220
stupid,
stupid,

117
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,690
stupid,
stupid plan,

118
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,300
so fantas will neither be forced nor 
tricked into giving up the gauntlet.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,580
It's too hard to punch or trick God.
No Fan Osu like doom in Hickman.

120
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:55,930
Secret wars will become convinced by our
heroes that his convictions were wrong,

121
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,033
that he doesn't deserve to be God,
and he will forfeit his power freely to 

122
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,660
the one who will convince Dan will be 
Tony Stark.

123
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,673
Since the first iron man movie stark has
been the defacto protagonist of the 

124
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:13,330
franchise more than any other character,
he's had the most dynamic character arcs

125
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,240
from narcissistic to self sacrificial 
and avengers,

126
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:20,680
one to the antagonist mired in 
consequentialist ethics and civil war to

127
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:23,500
realizing his ultimate failure and 
infinity war.

128
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,230
He will achieve the greatest redemption 
in the end.

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,420
Firstly,
by coming around to caps,

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,300
duty-bound way of seeing the world,
and secondly,

131
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,040
by being the one to defeat fan owes more
than any other character.

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,600
Tony has made the most improvement and 
is in need of the most improvements.

133
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,434
Still he'll go from someone too selfish 
to handle a relationship to someone so 

134
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:49,270
noble as to wield the power of a god 
with integrity.

135
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,530
We're guessing that starks conversation 
with pepper about his dream of her being

136
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:56,500
pregnant will propel this final growth 
in his character,

137
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,620
but we're not quite sure as to how 
lastly,

138
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,610
Stephen strange his decision not to 
sacrifice Tony's life to save the time.

139
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,444
Stone will prove the crux around which 
stark success and therefore the 

140
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:08,584
salvation of the universe will resolve.
But importantly it won't be because 

141
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:13,084
strange saw that that was the only way 
to achieve that one in 14 million 

142
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:18,460
future,
but for no other reason.

143
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:22,240
Then it was the right thing to do as an 
Hickman's work.

144
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,103
It will be explicit that doing the right
thing for no other reason than because 

145
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,990
it's right will lead our heroes to 
salvation.

146
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,010
And if you want to hear more of our 
predictions of what's coming in avengers

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,730
We're actually recording it today so it 
might be up in a day or two,

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,593

151
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,710

stitcher,

152
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:47,760

153
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,723
Also,
this is our first attempt to use 

154
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:52,210
philosophy for prediction rather than 
reflection.

155
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,850
So if you like it and want to see more,
let us know.

And as always,
thanks for watching guys.
