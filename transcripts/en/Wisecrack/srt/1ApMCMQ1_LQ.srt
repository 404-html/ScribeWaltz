1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,960
I think right now I'm,
one of the ways they're making our lives

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:11,070
better is they make people think right.
That's one of the things.

3
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,950
Video Games are good at you in order to 
win the game.

4
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,830
You can't just sit there,
you have to think,

5
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:20,520
you have to think and engage and make 
decisions.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,773
And I think right now when you,
when you talk now to the people who are 

7
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,334
at the forefront of educational reform,
all of them are talking about how do we 

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,360
use these games.
I see how powerful they are.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,230
They're all picking them up like some 
kind of sword and trying to charge in to

10
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:40,860
figure out how to use this to make 
education better.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,843
I think in terms of improving ourselves,
I think that's one of the areas we're 

12
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,744
going to see at the forefront,
but I think they're going to be many 

13
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,340
other areas as well.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,980
I mean we've already seen the success of
things like the we fit,

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,121
which is,
you know,

16
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,580
an exercise platform,
uh,

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,790
for the,
for the weekend.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,673
It's been incredibly popular in terms of
people sticking with it and it really 

19
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:04,530
changing their lives.
I'm not so sure,

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,380
but the fact that they've already made I
think $2,000,000,000

21
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:12,380
selling those things speaks to the fact 
that this is something people want you,

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,333
you know,
you talk to wealthy people who have a 

23
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,680
personal trainer and they talk about how
effective it is.

24
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:17,514
This person comes in and says,
you need to do this and you need to do 

25
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:23,430
that and there's a social pressure in 
order for you to kind of do this and not

26
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,264
let the trainer down and trainers know 
these kinds of psychological tricks in 

27
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,580
order to kind of put you right at the 
right level.

28
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,414
You need to be.

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,050
Everyone will be able to have that kind 
of personal trainer.

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,310
I'm not only just for the physical,
physical things and exercise,

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
but for their education,
for their hobbies,

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,190
for their art,
for their spirituality,

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,340
for anything in their life that they'd 
like to improve.

34
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:52,341
That is certainly true.
That there are people who,

35
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,543
uh,
play video games in a way that makes 

36
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:57,414
their life out of balance.
Usually these are people who have some 

37
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:04,230
significant gap in their life and 
they're,

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,260
they're filling it with something.
In a way that is isn't healthy.

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,760
Um,
some people say,

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,623
you know,
you occasionally hear people make this 

41
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,670
accusation that,
well,

42
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,504
you know,
the way there's these problems with 

43
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:19,080
video game addiction,
it's ruining people's lives.

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,063
And the problem is these video game 
designers try and make the games too 

45
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,514
compelling.
They designed the games to be addictive 

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,470
and if they would just stop doing that,
the problem would go away.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,730
But this is like saying that obesity is 
the fault of the bakers.

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,653
We're making the cakes too delicious.
And if only you would make the cakes a 

49
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,434
little less tasty,
there would be this whole obesity 

50
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,280
problem would go away,
right?

51
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,890
That's not where the problem,
the problem lies.

52
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,724
The problem lies with people 
understanding how to take these 

53
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,790
entertainment experiences and integrate 
them in a healthy way,

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,470
um,
incident their lives,

55
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,940
uh,
as,

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,020
as predominant as these entertainments 
are in our lives.

57
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,270
The problem does not.
I mean,

58
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,460
it's definitely a problem for some 
people.

59
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,650
It doesn't seem to be an epidemic 
problem.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,430
It is definitely a problem for some 
people and it's certainly worthy of sort

61
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,150
of study and understanding about how to 
best manage it.
