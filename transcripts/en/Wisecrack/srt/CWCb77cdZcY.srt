1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,360
What's up guys.
Jared here and today we're talking about

2
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:09,410
one of the best anime of the year,
season two of my hero academia,

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,683
my hero academia.
Ask some serious questions about 

4
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:13,334
heroism,
namely our all of our heroes full of 

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,040
woken list.
Wisecrack quick take on my hero academia

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:23,600
season two and of course spoilers ahead 
for those uninitiated.

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:24,434
Here's a quick recap.
Mindoro academia takes place in a world 

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:32,141
war 80% of people manifest some sort of 
superpower or quirk and being a hero has

9
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,100
finally become a full time job.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,160
Canela cut staff in [inaudible] 89 can 
you kind of assume road

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,450
and eight glamorous one at that middle 
school or mid Doria is Zuku yearns to be

12
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:45,070
like his idol.
Be Hero.

13
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:50,071
All Mike but unfortunately is cordless.
But after demonstrating his selflessness

14
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:54,340
to all might madorie heir receives his 
very own powers from his hero.

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,910
Done a show with me.
She mean you seemed you to walk us snow.

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,340
We got it.
Good at the dock,

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,101
kimmy.
No,

18
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,010
been through your uncle too.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,423
After a year of training,
memoria enrolls in the exclusive high 

20
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:21,880
school for will be heroes UAA academy.
At the end of season one,

21
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,150
he and his classmates come face to face 
with some real bad guys.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,073
The League of villains led by sugar,
Rocky Tamara only for all might to save 

23
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:30,970
the day.
Now,

24
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,130
there are a lot of great moments in 
season two,

25
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:36,910
but where this question of what it means
to be a hero really comes to the fore is

26
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:37,744
during the stain art class,
President Eda 10 ya'll learns that his 

27
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:44,260
brother has been attacked by the hero 
killer stain stain.

28
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:45,094
Believe that today's heroes are more 
concerned with their own image than 

29
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,603
actually doing good.
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,600
[inaudible] [inaudible]

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,593
determined to get revenge eda then 
interns with the less than prestigious 

32
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,344
normal hero in order to find stain.
Wild Memoria Doria is stuck well with 

33
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:13,860
this guy and as sugar rocky on leashes,
a hoard of biologically engineered super

34
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:14,694
villains on the city.
Eda memoria and fellow classmate Tota 

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,350
Roci managed to converge on stain and 
capture him.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,210
The stain arch raises the question what 
causes our obsession with heroism?

37
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,990
According to philosopher Ernest Becker,
the desire to be a hero is innate.

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,003
It's the desire to be the very best at 
something and ultimately to be 

39
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:36,970
remembered and thereby transcend death.
But most of us aren't.

40
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,670
Heroes were Jerry's or some mentos at 
best.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,593
Instead,
Becker tells us that we redirect this 

42
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:46,000
desire into society or what he calls 
cultural hero systems.

43
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,480
Bummed.
You're not all might.

44
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,940
That's okay.
Feel special because in genomes,

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,780
younger brother interns at your hero 
agency sad.

46
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,000
You're not always saving the day.
Who Cares?

47
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,834
You can still feature on a TV talk show 
panel because of your ridiculous 

48
00:02:58,271 --> 00:02:59,104
costume.
It's this kind of hero worship which 

49
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:05,620
stain opposes instead of believing that 
Hiro's must epitomize self sacrifice.

50
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,013
[inaudible] you doing [inaudible] sold 
off all [inaudible] here you she don't 

51
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,874
even know.
Hygiene,

52
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,230
sugar,
bodily organ music.

53
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,853
She's a good mother.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,673
Same rejects a society that treats 
heroes like celebrities paying them for 

55
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,024
capturing villains and allowing them to 
use their status for lucrative side 

56
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,354
hustles.
Same believes that being a superhero 

57
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,880
with an asterisk isn't being a superhero
at all.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,000
And this argument isn't all that crazy.
And in fact,

59
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,940
mirrors and idea that philosopher slash 
senior men's models,

60
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:01,090
Jacques Derrida dubbed unconditional 
hospitality.

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,390
To Derrida.
Unconditional hospitality is a pure,

62
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,000
unbounded kindness and generosity to 
others.

63
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,163
A law without law,
as he confusingly called it to dairy 

64
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,154
dot.
True absolute hospitality cannot be 

65
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,090
imposed upon by rules,
duties,

66
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,370
or laws,
whether they be legal,

67
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,900
cultural,
or even moral.

68
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,010
Otherwise it stops being unconditional.
As one thinker put it,

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,660
the law of hospitality is absolute in 
that it requires one to give all one has

70
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:33,340
to another without asking any questions 
and posing any restrictions or requiring

71
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,174
any compensation.
If we apply Derrida's logic to my hair 

72
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,043
academia,
the heroes are only acting out a 

73
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,943
conditional hospitality.
How you look over your care team may 

74
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,390
accuse you of doing the bowl game though
he acts Sonia Super.

75
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,763
So I'll say [inaudible].
You hope this is particularly the case 

76
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,554
with Eda who is so wrapped up in his 
desire for revenge that he forgets what 

77
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,410
it means to be a hero.
Putting others first.

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,670
And Dakota Hito [inaudible] will know to
know Tom,

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,530
any wholesale when eat a stumbles upon 
stain attacking native eva,

80
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,690
is it really coming to the rescue 
instead,

81
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:15,190
he's implicitly making natives rescue 
contingent on him getting what he wants,

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,020
killing stain and saying the perceptive 
slasher tells it as it is.

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
Does Dad oh you to a muzzle Tuscan.

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,980
Here's the Kodo clady meets a toast 
credo.

85
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:35,981
Say [inaudible] she cuddles [inaudible] 
feudal kind of tumor.

86
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,600
By the way,
this white team was really awesome.

87
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:47,870
Probably one of the best of the season 
and if you want to see it broken down by

88
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:48,704
one of our friends,
check out jeff over at mother's 

89
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:51,164
basement.
He just dropped a video analyzing all 

90
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,160
the things that make this fight scene 
incredible.

91
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,110
So check them out in the link in the 
description.

92
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,060
You won't regret it.
Anyway,

93
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,570
this all goes to show what makes 
medallia and all mites special.

94
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,080
They're unwavering adherence to 
unconditional hospitality.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,170
In fact,
it's Madorie as willingness to sacrifice

96
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,004
himself for others,
even without a quirk that originally 

97
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,340
drew all might the him,

98
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,503
you.

99
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,010
And over the course of seasons one and 
two,

100
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:33,640
we see memorial putting himself on the 
line over and over again,

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,220
whether it's leaping into the fray 
against the League of villains,

102
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:40,900
when all my team's down for the count or
arriving last minute to save Edo Stain.

103
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,830
Hell Madora can even use one for all 
without essentially shattering the bones

104
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,810
in his body,
but that's never stopped him.

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Of course,
stain recognizes this trait.

106
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Memoria initially sparing him 
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible],

107
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,250
but [inaudible] is only a pale 
comparison of what stain really wants to

108
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,084
fight the symbol of peace himself.
After stain saves Memoria from being 

109
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,780
abducted,
he declares Jamie,

110
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,810
no,
no,

111
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,290
no,
no shale.

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
That's right.
Staying motivated to make a more just 

113
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:27,080
society will only let himself be brought
down by eight true hero.

114
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,480
The embodiment of unconditional 
hospitality all might.

115
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,740
Now stain isn't the main villain of my 
hero academia,

116
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,930
but his impact has really felt in the 
seasons.

117
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,764
Concluding episode,
what starts as a day off from a 

118
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,224
Dorianne,
his classmates ends with Memoria being 

119
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,603
briefly held captive by sugar rocky.
Now sugar rocky is royally pissed at 

120
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,750
stain for scorning him and drawing so 
much attention.

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,840
Martin Davis,
so good [inaudible].

122
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,383
What sugar,
rocky can't see is how he's different 

123
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,450
than stain,
but asthma.

124
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:00,210
Doria explains staying stands for 
something.

125
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,113
Costa Rica cost is on tonight.
I know he does it on him though it does 

126
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,010
go to the mall.
He Sony,

127
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,913
Datto.

128
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,363
Now to end this,
we're going to invoke a little more 

129
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,194
becker here.
Remember those cultural hero systems in 

130
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,164
society?
He said they were all based on the 

131
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,390
denial of death.
The reason why we strive to get a raise,

132
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,224
fall in love or even start a family is 
because even if we're only side 

133
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:29,184
characters and then pcs were desperately
trying to feel special in our little 

134
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,054
corner of the universe and be remembered
to becker though society would crumble 

135
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:37,794
if we ever realized how little our 
deaths actually mean to the unfeeling 

136
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,660
universe.
As such,

137
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:43,494
we have to desperately protect these 
fragile artificial hero systems that 

138
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:47,754
make up society.
This issue of confronting death becomes 

139
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:50,994
even more pronounced in the world of my 
hero academia where your everyday 

140
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,624
citizens mortality constantly put on 
display when supervillains can appear 

141
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,244
and kill hundreds in an instant.
How does your average person go about 

142
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,020
living their life?
Just as in our lives,

143
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:04,854
people can only create meaning by 
building up images of heroes and for 

144
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:11,070
shipping and specifically the symbol of 
peace himself.

145
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,940
All might as shooter rocky releases 
Madorie.

146
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:17,190
Yet he realizes he's been driven by an 
ideal all along.

147
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,280
Destroying the symbol that gives society
eats

148
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,960
quite sort of [inaudible]. [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

149
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,950
So what do you think?
Wise cracking,
