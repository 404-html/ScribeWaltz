1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,713
Okay.
That was this one meeting of that the 

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,103
World Economic Forum,
uh,

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,560
conducts out of maybe 20 meetings during
New Year around the world.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,060
But Davos is so called the annual 
meetings.

5
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:27,080
So,
uh,

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,183
it is dinorah just of our meetings and 
it is the meeting which is attended by 

7
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:37,571
the highest level of the participants 
have a CEO's heads of state,

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,820
academia,
civil society,

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,330
international organizations.
Uh,

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,010
and so every component of society is 
represented there.

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,983
And the purpose is to talk about the 
major issues confronting us on a global 

12
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:00,494
basis.

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,580
I think the effects have been very,
very positive because the forum promotes

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,050
dialogue between various stakeholders 
that the form is,

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,453
the form is just a platform that brings 
together people from all the components 

16
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:26,344
of society.
It sit down around the table and talk 

17
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:29,644
about the issues.
And that's pretty unique because in 

18
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:36,400
today's world it's hard to,
uh,

19
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,960
hard to achieve anything without 
gathering all the stakeholders together.

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,453
It will achieve first understanding of 
the issues or awareness of some of the 

21
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:51,751
issues and the form positions itself as 
a catalyst to action.

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,430
So we're not ourselves involved directly
into doing something,

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,250
but we are,
uh,

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,550
we are a catalyst throughout those 
dialogue,

25
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:05,380
those discussions,
those meetings,

26
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,813
things come out of there are being put 
in place either directly by some of the 

27
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:14,110
participants or by a group of 
participants.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,900
We have meetings in,
in Asia,

29
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,160
we have meeting in Latin America and 
Africa and the Middle East in Europe,

30
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,290
in the states.
So,

31
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,124
uh,
and we have annual meetings with major 

32
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:29,860
one being that was the other one being 
in China every year.

33
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,520
And really the whole world is 
represented as well as all,

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,310
cause I said component society from 
everywhere.

35
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,144
Yeah.
