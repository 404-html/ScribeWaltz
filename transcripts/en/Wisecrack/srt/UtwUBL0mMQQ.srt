1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,520
Hey,
wise,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,070
crack jared here.
Okay,

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,110
so we're going to do something a little 
risky,

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:07,944
a little crazy,
and maybe even a little sack religious 

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,963
weren't criticizing Pixel because even 
though it's brought us the tear jerking 

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:18,030
joys of inside out wally and the toy 
story saga,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,230
it's genius is not entirely above some 
sloppy storytelling.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,660
Turns out no studio can resist the 
allure of a cash grab,

9
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:26,494
grabby sequel,
and that's kind of what 2016 finding 

10
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,364
dory felt like to us,
it just didn't seem as emotionally 

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:32,694
resident as pixars best work and being 
the obsessive nerds that we are here at 

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,073
wise crack.
We had to ask ourselves why it's worth 

13
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,030
mentioning here that according to the 
Guardian,

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,953
finding dory underwent massive rewrites 
where those rewrites to blame for our 

15
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,200
dissatisfaction with the movie is 
finding glory,

16
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:53,460
a lesser film than finding Nemo.
Is this simply a case of sql lightest or

17
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:55,080
we just overfish stories?

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,060
Well,
let's lay this thing and find out.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,640
Welcome to wise crack addiction on 
finding dory.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,380
What went wrong?
And as always,

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,720
spoilers ahead,
but before we dive in,

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,583
thanks to the team at lastpass who 
helped make this video possible like 

23
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,584
everyone,
you're probably tempted to use the same 

24
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
cube passwords over and over again.
I mean seriously coming up with hard to 

25
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,220
crack passwords and remembering where 
you've used them.

26
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,054
It's just a pain using the same 
passwords again and again is a pretty 

27
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,710
bad idea.
Sites like Tumblr,

28
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:22,350
Linkedin,
even Domino's had been hacked before and

29
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:24,300
with a constant flow of new data 
breaches,

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,163
it's nearly impossible to keep track of 
which hacked site could be jeopardizing 

31
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,330
your online security.
That's where lastpass comes in.

35
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:39,870
more hassles.

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,060
No more remembering which password is 
for which site.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,280
No more forgetting where you wrote them 
down.

38
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,320
No more getting locked out of your own 
accounts.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,273
You can safely and easily surf the net 
and avoid having to enter the first 

40
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,830
concert you ever went to or your 
grandmothers cousins made.

41
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,664
Name the free version is great,
and if you want the premium features

00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,260
like family sharing and priority 
support,

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,123
it's just a couple bucks a month.
Thanks to lastpass for sponsoring this 

44
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,214
video and check them out in the link in 
the description to get started and now 

45
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,784
on with the show finding dory comes up 
short and at least four key areas we're 

46
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,480
finding nemo excels for the sake of 
clarity,

47
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,280
let's categorize these problems as one 
clouded emotional investment too.

48
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,920
Shaky narrative structure,
three,

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,670
passive heroism and for purposeless 
entourage.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,713
To be fair,
these issues are almost impossible to 

51
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,504
separate from one another,
so there will inevitably be some 

52
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,440
overlap,
but here we go anyway.

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,070
First,
the question of emotional investment,

54
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,003
a key objective of any screenplay is to 
get the audience to care deeply about 

55
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,754
the protagonist,
a goal that's often achieved by first 

56
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,394
getting us to care about whatever our 
protagonist most values and slash or 

57
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,114
needs.
Maybe the protagonist is focused on 

58
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,394
scoring and internship or going the 
distance in the boxing ring or on 

59
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,294
breaking free of a suffocating life.
Whatever the case in most strong 

60
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,210
screenplays that desire is established 
early,

61
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,310
it's singular,
it's powerful,

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,010
and it generates our empathy in finding 
nemo and finding dory.

63
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,700
The protagonist's goals are blatantly 
similar in the first film,

64
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,070
Marlin searches for his kidnap son in 
the second door.

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,850
He searches for the parents.
She hazely remembers,

66
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,803
although there's nothing wrong with 
leaning on the trope of the missing 

67
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,710
family member.
I mean it works for Liam Neeson.

68
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,543
Finding Nemo and finding dory 
unfortunately have different attitudes 

69
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,144
toward the magnitude of loss.
That's because only one of these films 

70
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:28,804
offers us a baseline before it rips a 
loved one away and it's that baseline 

71
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,900
that creates emotional connection 
between us,

72
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,210
the protagonist and the protagonists 
need.

73
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,223
In other words,
even though the bulk of finding Nemo 

74
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,444
keeps Marlin and Nemo apart,
it first offers a sense of what these 

75
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,614
family members mean to one another as 
early as the first minute of finding 

76
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,790
Nemo Porch.
Hold what?

77
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,340
Marlin values more than anything else in
the world.

78
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,620
These are our kids.
We're talking about thinking they're the

79
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,454
best,
and Marlin proves that value system 

80
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,870
through his actions in the films 
baseline moments.

81
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,150
We see Marlin pledged to protect his 
son,

82
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,180
then tease his son,
then prepare his son for school,

83
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,940
then bring his son to school and then 
lecture his son.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,600
You're about to swim in open water.
We have a sense of history,

85
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,930
so when Mimo gets kidnapped 15 minutes 
into the film,

86
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,410
we like Marlin,
have loved and we have lost.

87
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,363
We are infested.
Finding Dory offers no such baseline so 

88
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,760
it never offers the Gut Punch delivered 
by its predecessor.

89
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,773
In fact,
dory loses her parents within the first 

90
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:30,790
five minutes of finding dory in the 
opening scene of the film,

91
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,550
Dory,
even to her own parents is positioned as

92
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,190
something of a liability.
A cute little goof.

93
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,030
Okay,
sweetheart.

94
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,710
What about that rhyme?
We learn,

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,040
we see the undertow and we say no,
no,

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,580
surely thereafter,
like bubbles in the bath tub.

97
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,433
Her parents vanish.
How much can we really be expected to 

98
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,780
pour our emotions into losing characters
we never knew?

99
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,890
Where are your parents?

100
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,910
If finding dory can't get much mileage 
out of the parent child bond,

101
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,560
that energized,
finding Nemo.

102
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,230
Then what is the central relationship 
here?

103
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,243
Where do we invest our empathy?
You might guess that we feed into the 

104
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,230
bond between Marlin and Dory.
After all,

105
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,980
they did spend a whole movie together.
They're probably totally buds now,

106
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,180
right?
Or what you can do.

107
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,683
You can go wait over there,
go right over there and forgot to do 

108
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,260
best.
Not really.

109
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,153
Seems the arc of personal growth that 
Marlin and Dory experienced in finding 

110
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,204
nemo has reverted here with Dory now 
being viewed as a nuisance by pretty 

111
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,760
much everyone.
Sadly,

112
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,594
it isn't until dory is separated from 
the relationships she formed in the 

113
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:38,224
first film that were introduced to what 
is supposed to be her source of support 

114
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:45,460
in this movie,
the bond between Dory and Hank,

115
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,533
a curmudgeonly octopus who wants only to
exploit dory for the transport tag 

116
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,580
attached to her fit.

117
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,260
No,
no,

118
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,280
no.
If I just take your bag,

119
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,200
I can take your place on the transport 
truck and yeah,

120
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:00,050
I mean that's pretty much it.
That's the nature of their friendship.

121
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,210
Heartwarming,
right?

122
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,020
The emotionally deficient relationship 
between hank and dory is almost entirely

123
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,854
transactional and deceitful,
which doubles down on the films empathy 

124
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,964
gap.
But later finding dory hastily tries to 

125
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,830
switch gears and that brings us to our 
second point,

126
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,813
shaky narrative structure.
Take a look at most memorable films and 

127
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,594
you'll find the protagonist making a key
decision right at the center of the 

128
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,434
story.
It's a moment that reframes the 

129
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,594
protagonists,
objectives and tests his or her resolve 

130
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,863
some.
Refer to this as the film's midpoint 

131
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,143
shift.
It's no coincidence that the halfway 

132
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:37,670
mark is often a major moment of self 
reflection for the protagonists,

133
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,653
a turning point in his or her journey.
So what happens halfway through finding 

134
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:43,760
dory?

135
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,593
Well,
hank reveals he's got a soft spot for 

136
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,680
that loopy bluefish.
He'll forgive me in a heartbeat.

137
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:53,681
Kid 300 new.
But where did this sentiment come from?

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,953
It's surely not earned by any particular
actions or moments in the film itself 

139
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,570
because hanging dory are never really a 
team.

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,583
And unlike Dorian Marlin,
they're never really shown enjoying 

141
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,850
their adventure.
And Hey,

142
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,970
come to think of it,
hank isn't even the protagonist here.

143
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,790
In any case,
since Dorian,

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,633
hank have almost no moments of genuine 
connection within the first half of 

145
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,430
finding dory hanks.
Change of heart towards Dory,

146
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,640
midway through the film.
Can't help but feel unearned.

147
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,543
I don't care.
Contrast this with the realization 

148
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,654
Marlin experiences in the middle of 
finding nema and maybe wouldn't have 

149
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,100
done it if I hadn't been so tough on him
here.

150
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:35,210
Marlin begins to recognize the error of 
his overprotective parenting style,

151
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,170
and this realization is a direct result 
of his control freak behavior,

152
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,050
nearly getting dory killed throughout 
finding Nemo.

153
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,460
This midpoint shifts and other character
revealing moments are directly motivated

154
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,294
by cause and effect.
Mimo is motivated to put his life in 

155
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,010
jeopardy because he learns his dad is 
heroic.

156
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,040
Ua Dad's been fighting the entire ocean.
Looking for you.

157
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,810
Marlin is motivated to team with Dory 
because he realizes dory can read.

158
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,890
You can read,
I can read later.

159
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:04,724
Marlin is motivated to separate himself 
from Dory because he thinks his son is 

160
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,220
dead in finding dory.
However,

161
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,540
key moments in the story like hanks 
change of heart towards dory are largely

162
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,280
motivated by convenience and necessity.
There are simply what needs to happen to

163
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,610
move characters from point a to point b 
later.

164
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:23,444
Dory refers the hank as sweet,
even though evidence of any such 

165
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,760
sweetness is scarce at best,
but hey,

166
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,653
in this movie being an acid pretty 
easily forgiven as long as you pay lip 

167
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,080
service to some sort of growth deep into
finding dory.

168
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,310
Marlin tells story for,
since I've met you,

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,480
you show me how to do stuff I never 
dreamed of doing crazy thing,

170
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,893
but even this sentiment to seems 
unearned because it leverages moments 

171
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,154
from the first fill in which Dorian 
Marlin adventured and grew closer 

172
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,823
together rather than from this sequel in
which they are either separated from 

173
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,260
each other or annoyed.
Nevertheless,

174
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,123
this moment is meant to play as a moment
of self awareness and maturity from 

175
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,410
Marlin,
which raises the question,

176
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,280
what is doerries key moment of self 
awareness in finding dory?

177
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:16,390
You are remembered in your own amazing 
dory way.

178
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,453
Wow.
You've got to wait until the movie is 

179
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,580
nearly over to find out,
and this illustrates,

180
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,550
finding doerries.
Third Setback,

181
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,890
passive heroism for much of the film's 
running time.

182
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,753
Dori operates as a passive protagonists,
one who responds to events rather than 

183
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:31,674
create opportunities.
Some have this tendency is due to we're 

184
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:34,764
all too convenient memory flashes which 
handily take the story wherever the 

185
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,534
screenwriters needed to go.
These flashes and even the occasional 

186
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,254
undertow are driven more by chance and 
proximity then as a result of personal 

187
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,640
effort or growth.
Although sometimes it's almost as if the

188
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,940
film is suggesting doerries disability 
can be willed away.

189
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,860
I remembered something.
This perspective seems fishy at best and

190
00:09:58,861 --> 00:09:59,694
it doesn't leave Dory with many 
opportunities to demonstrate her 

191
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,174
ingenuity and develop it.
Events often happened to dory rather 

192
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,434
than because of her,
and that's never a recipe for great 

193
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:11,340
storytelling.
Of course,

194
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,174
a another cause of Doris passivity is 
the nature of the films actual 

195
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,014
environment.

196
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,120
After the films,
first 20 minutes,

197
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,060
dory quite literally becomes a fish out 
of water,

198
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,170
a status which restricts her movements 
to the whims of other characters.

199
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,040
How much can we expect our protagonists 
to be the master of her own fate,

200
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,500
which is being carried around in coffee 
pots,

201
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,410
baby buggies,
or a bucket that's labeled destiny.

202
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,603
By trading the thrilling blue ocean of 
the first film to the claustrophobic 

203
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,240
human centric clinical spaces of finding
dory.

204
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,103
Pixar ultimately hamstrings the scope of
the story it's able to tell and the 

205
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,690
degree to which as protagonists can help
tell it.

206
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,870
Dory then isn't a driver of her own 
story.

207
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,853
She's a passenger,
a passive responder to triggered 

208
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:59,520
memories and odd partnership and very 
often blind luck,

209
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,420
but at least her personal motivation 
remains relatively clear.

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
Do you know anyone who lost a kid a long
time ago?

211
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,660
That wouldn't be me.

212
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,583
She wants to find her parents,
and so if we're willing to buy into the 

213
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:14,590
premise of the film,
we must simply want to find them too.

214
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,700
Even though doerries desire to see her 
family is very conveniently triggered by

215
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,130
the school of fish saying the word

216
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,590
right.
That's

217
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,423
right.
It's true that doerries ultimate 

218
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:25,614
objective is never in doubt,
but the same can't always be said for 

219
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,484
Marlin in this film and it's even less 
clear for Nimo who at this point seems 

220
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,613
in desperate need of child protective 
services and this leads us to the 

221
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,350
purposeless entourage.
Oh,

222
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,980
pause here to ask a simple but important
question.

223
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,050
Why does finding dory involve all three 
of these fish and does nemos involvement

224
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:52,740
actually negatively impact our feelings 
about Dorian Marlin?

225
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,663
That's Marlin having just a year earlier
across the perilous ocean to save his 

226
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,144
only surviving child now agrees to drag 
that same child with him to guide dory 

227
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,700
all the way across the ocean.
Again,

228
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,730
simply because how can you be talking 
about the view?

229
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,310
And I remembered my.
No,

230
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,283
I'm okay,
but this springs from the studios need 

231
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,950
for a sequel,
not from clear character behavior.

232
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,993
Ultimately,
finding dory commits the sin of asking 

233
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:22,930
Marlin and Emo to undermine so much of 
what made finding nemo powerful.

234
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,883
After all the emotional investment we as
an audience made in Nemos recovery and 

235
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,354
finding Nemo.
Finding Dory asks us to believe that 

236
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:35,140
Marlin responsible father extraordinary 
is willing to risk his own son's life.

237
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:40,141
On the basis of Doris Hunch about her 
parents she hasn't seen in years and no,

238
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm not being hyperbolic.
Mimo really seriously almost dies.

239
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,020
I mean,
couldn't Marlin just find a babysitter?

240
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,680
Why is Nimo part of this new adventure?
Why does Dory,

241
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:55,000
who presumably cares about Nimo safety,
agreed to pull them along on a dangerous

242
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,310
mission to serve her own personal 
agenda?

243
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,720
The film mostly bypasses these questions
and if we are to enjoy it,

244
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,583
so most wheat,
but we should all take a moment here to 

245
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:05,464
at least recognize the weirdness of 
ending a fish movie with a car chase on 

246
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:09,964
the freeway and hey,
look at that door is a passenger again 

247
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,583
in her own movie.
