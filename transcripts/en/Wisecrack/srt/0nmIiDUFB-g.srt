1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,183
I believe that I have a very loud voice 
and I'm not ashamed or embarrassed or 

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,410
shying away from expressing what I 
think.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,423
I don't have to like everyone.
My website's called Perez Hilton Dot 

4
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,790
Com.
It's not called the New York Times.

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,090
I don't have to feign of activity.
I love the entertainment industry.

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,700
If I didn't,
I wouldn't still be in it and I wouldn't

7
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,470
have chosen that topic for my website.
When I first started blogging,

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,530
when I moved to Los Angeles in 2002,
I wanted to be an actor,

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,340
but like nine out of 10 people that 
moved to Los Angeles,

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,370
it didn't work for me and I'm so 
thankful because I'm so much happier now

11
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,723
doing what I do then if I would have 
been an actor that was struggling to 

12
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,690
work or even if I did get some kind of 
success.

13
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,930
I love being my own boss.
I love calling the shots and I love what

14
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:13,340
I do.
I feel really lucky.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
My perspective on fame hasn't changed at
all because I'm still normal.

16
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,670
I'm a normal person and I do normal 
things.

17
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,190
I haven't let fame affect me.
Uh,

18
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,490
which sometimes people do,
they can buy into their own hype.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
I think the fact that I have an alter 
ego helps and I think the fact that for 

20
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,504
every two people that like me,
there's probably four point five that 

21
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,900
hate me.
That also helps too.

22
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,280
So I don't think that I'm hot shit,
you know,

23
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,920
I don't have a big head.
Well,

24
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:53,754
I already do have a big head,
but I don't have as big a head as I 

25
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,124
could have.
