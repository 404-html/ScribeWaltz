1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,780
Hey guys finally got a haircut.
Jared here,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,793
after 14 years of patiently waiting,
we finally got to see the incredibles 

3
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:15,090
two and it pretty much shattered all the
predictions we made on our movie.

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,310
Podcasts showed me the meaning.
Now as the movie,

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,360
good.
Yes,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,710
well,
we expected that,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,850
but what surprised us is just how 
thoughtful the film is and it all has to

8
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,684
do with the films villain screen slaver 
not only to screen slaver Dole out some 

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,194
majorly relevant commentary on the 
effects of our culture's obsession with 

10
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,264
screens,
but her presence Mike just make the 

11
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:39,300
incredibles two the most subversive 
superhero movie ever made.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,193
So welcome to this wisecrack quick take 
on the incredibles two and watch out a 

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,920
monster amount of spoilers ahead,
but as always,

14
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,460
first a quick recap.
Helen gets recruited by media mogul,

15
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:51,294
Winston Devers,
new PR campaign is goal change the 

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,044
public face of supers in order to reform
their image and eventually changed the 

17
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,790
laws that outlawed them.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,400
Meanwhile,
Mr incredible has to take over parenting

19
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:03,234
duties,
which means helping violet through her 

20
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,124
boy drama and trying to contain Jack.
Jack's mind boggling new powers as the 

21
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,624
PR blitz kicks off,
Helen's job quickly takes her face to 

22
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:16,800
face with screen slaver who literally 
uses computers and television screens to

23
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,160
control people like a Jedi mind trick 
with a film degree.

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,053
Here's the fundamental theme at the core
of the films conflict that in the 

25
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:27,810
digital age perception has supplanted 
reality.

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,703
Early on,
Winston introduces us to this idea when 

27
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,390
he explains the real reason that 
superheroes were outlawed.

28
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,283
Public perception was against them 
because people associated superheroes 

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,600
with the crime scenes they superhero 
dad.

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,700
He argues that in order to change the 
law,

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,110
first we need to change people's 
perceptions about superheroes.

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,003
Essentially Winston's pitch is that the 
image of supers as communicated by the 

33
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,460
media is more real than their lived 
experience.

34
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,383
Thus,
Winston thinks that changing the public 

35
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,604
perception of supers rather than 
changing any of their actual deeds is 

36
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,774
essential to getting the ban lifted.
So his plan is to create a specially 

37
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,620
curated reality of supers to be consumed
by the American people.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,010
How will he do this?
By sticking a camera in Helen super suit

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,873
and making her both a walking virtual 
reality machine and a serious 

40
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,160
competition to twitch.
From there,

41
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:17,994
we meet the villains.
Screensaver later revealed to be Evelyn 

42
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,294
mind controlling a pizza delivery guy.
Everyone's motivation is actually a 

43
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,464
rather sophisticated critique of 
mindless media consumption and how it 

44
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,160
makes people passive participants in 
their own lives.

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,053
She gives a truly epic monologue in 
which she complained about the way how 

46
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,660
everything meaningful must be packaged 
into talk shows,

47
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,250
game shows,
travel shows,

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,093
etc.
Gc supers as an essential part of that 

49
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,384
media landscape and that they offer a 
security and comfort that keeps the 

50
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,890
masses docile.

51
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,903
Now,
this is where our philosophy census 

52
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,660
started tinGling the plot of 
inCredibles.

53
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:58,140
Two is a neon sign pointing to 
philosopher slash guy.

54
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:02,320
We'd like to mention a lot the genre 
baudrillard who wrote about the power of

55
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:07,090
screens to influence our opinions and 
indeed control our lives.

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,410
In his book screened out,
he argues that video interactive screens

57
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,970
and virtual reality have brought us into
a state of perpetual interactivity where

58
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:20,740
there's no longer any separation between
the media we consume and lives we lead.

59
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,663
If anything,
he argues the virtual reality of the 

60
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,580
internet,
tv,

61
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,414
and video games seems more real than the
world we inhabit and even supersedes 

62
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,920
reality.
Both winston and evelyn take this theory

63
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,754
and run with it in very different ways.
Each is trying to use the mediated 

64
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,224
image.
I eat the perception of superheroes to 

65
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,690
change reality.
I belong.

66
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,863
Baudrillard says that the real aim of 
media consumption is to hide or 

67
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,430
disappear into the virtual.

68
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,323
An idea that evelyn's goggles and 
screens exaggerate to great effect by 

69
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,764
hypnotizing people into a fugue state in
which they are completely detached from 

70
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,690
the real world.
In this way,

71
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:03,160
the film warns about the harmful power 
of screens to control our lives.

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,173
the immersive power of helen's pov crime
fighting videos create exactly the kind 

73
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,124
of absorbing media bosure discusses.
That's why they're so effective and 

74
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,560
immediately start shifting public 
opinion.

75
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,480
Also,
it's good for plot development.

76
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,500
helen's emo of saving people from bad 
guys hasn't changed a bit,

77
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,380
but now that people can see her bravery 
up close,

78
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,303
it's suddenly more real at times.
The movie isn't too subtle about any of 

79
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,170
this.
At one point,

80
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,033
evelyn and helen debate like drunk 
philosophy majors about whether the 

81
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,484
selling of the product I the mediated 
image of it is more important than the 

82
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,344
product itself.
Now they can't come to a solid 

83
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:40,954
conclusion,
which seems fair because modern 

84
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,204
philosophers can't either and they've 
had thousands of pages of writing on 

85
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,834
which to try.

86
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,060
Of course,
we later learned that evelyn's beef with

87
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,600
superheroes is less egg heady and more 
personal.

88
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,910
WheN burglars broke into her family's 
home,

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,240
her father counted on his superhero 
buddies to save him.

90
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,540
Instead of using his safe room,
he was shot dead.

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,433
And as a result,
she now blamed superheroes for her 

92
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:05,764
father's passed city and clear inability
to think logically in high pressure 

93
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:12,100
situations.
So she decides to use the very thing she

94
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:17,101
despises the image of supers to destroy 
their viability and importance to her.

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,250
Not only do screens make us passive 
observers in our own lives,

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,080
but the image of superheroes on those 
screens does something similar.

97
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,990
The images of benevolent,
all powerful beings,

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,140
perhaps primus,
to believe like evelyn's dad,

99
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,250
that our problems will be solved by 
strong altruistic individuals,

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,720
but wait a second,
aren't we to watching the incredibles?

101
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:41,554
Two,
a superhero movie through a screen and 

102
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,214
see,
this is where the film gets potentially 

103
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:48,280
very subversive.

104
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,283
Are we not also participating in this 
same vicarious hero worship when we 

105
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:57,830
watched in awe as the incredible saved 
the day on the flashy silver screen?

106
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
So what are we supposed to think of 
watching a superhero movie that 

107
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,030
criticizes the effects of selling 
superheroes?

108
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,770
do mediated images?
Well,

109
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,440
ultimately the ending is pretty 
comforting to fans.

110
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,650
Be incredible.
Stop screen slaver supers are made legal

111
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:16,760
again by some sort of un knockoff and 
evelyn is carted off by the police,

112
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,510
but just when everything is about to be 
wrapped up nice and neat.

113
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,553
Violet,
who's third power is apparently sarcasm 

114
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,170
immediately jumps in to cast doubt on 
our happy ending saying,

115
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm sorry that she's super rich and will
only get like two years in jail,

116
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,280
so should the incredible saving the city
from that giant yachts,

117
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:36,980
warpath convinced us that everything's 
all good,

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,880
or is brad bird pointing at something 
more sinister with violence?

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,713
Final quip is he suggesting that viewing
such an uplifting ending brought by the 

120
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,184
hands of almighty benign superheroes 
might make us feel satisfied even 

121
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:53,090
pacified when in reality,
whatever that is,

122
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,690
there are still many injustices that 
need to be addressed,

123
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,673
but what do you guys think?
Is this the first superhero movie to 

124
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,620
promote a critical view on the effects 
of superhero movies?

125
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,900
Let us know what you guys think in the 
comments and hey,

126
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,740

133
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,903
It's not about subjecting these movies 
to a level of literalism that they 

134
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:34,190
weren't built for.
It's all about appreciation and it's not

135
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,350
even just about appreciating the surface
level stuff.
