This video is brought to you by 
skillshare.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,600
Hey,
wise,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,610
crack,
jared here.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,713
One of the most Cathartic things about 
art for me is that it can give voice to 

5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,300
our frustrations with the world,
but while mocking,

6
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,134
this system is as old as art itself in 
the 20th century of version of this 

7
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:20,134
story became popular in which characters
not only criticize the system but 

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:26,870
actively escape it.
I can cut it down,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,390
but recently something a bit different 
has become popular,

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,383
like hero rises up to defeat,
a degrading and exploitative system who 

11
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:37,620
we know is fake bikes,
but in no time at all,

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,693
something happens.
The system manages to win in Black 

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,223
Mirror,
at least our heroes rebellion against a 

14
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,084
system of compulsory exercise that is 
only redeemable for worthless forms of 

15
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:53,550
entertainment and digital swag gets sold
as a worthless form of entertainment and

16
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,384
digital swag.
Is this the perfect metaphor for the 

17
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,114
world we live in?

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,013
Where anticapitalists insurrection one 
day get sold in mass by a large 

19
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,454
corporation.
The next or how are we all just become 

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,064
nihilists?
Join me live from the system itself as 

21
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,690
we dive into classics like network or 
Matrix,

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,040
fight club,
sorry to Bob,

23
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,170
you and a few others to ask the 
question,

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,750
is resistance even possible?
Oh,

25
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,800
also rick and Morty,
because who can resist and yeah,

26
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,840
heavy spoilers ahead,
but first,

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,730
how did we get here in the US during the
19 thirties factories dominated economic

28
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,564
life and while those were the days where
many people could raise a family by 

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,750
tightening rivets or something,
artists like Charlie Chaplin,

30
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,300
we're showing the bleaker side of this 
in his film,

31
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,134
modern times chaplain expressed 
anxieties about losing oneself to 

32
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:40,584
factory life.
Chaplains spends the film struggling to 

33
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:44,220
stand out,
express himself,

34
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,054
or make anything meaningful of his life.
The film really captures one central 

35
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,190
complaint about fordist capitalism.

36
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,890
Work was repetitive,
meaningless,

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,753
and empty.
You spend time on some assembly line or 

38
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,980
doing paperwork for your boss,
and there was no individuality,

39
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:02,010
creativity,
or authenticity involved at all.

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,113
At the end of the film,
he resists the monotony of his life by 

41
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,950
walking off into the sunset to find his 
brighter,

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,813
more authentic future.
This fixation on the dehumanization of 

43
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,444
factory work and the escape,
the something authentic evolved as our 

44
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,970
economy did.
If it wasn't repetitive factory work,

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,833
it was repetitive,
pointless office work like in fight 

46
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,074
club,
the narrator rails against the 

47
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,160
emasculating,
alienating nature of consumerism.

48
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,053
This is your life and it's ending one 
minimum of time before Rowdy Tyler 

49
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,284
durden sets up a gladiator pit for men 
to express their authentic masculinity 

50
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,423
and occasionally engage in domestic 
terrorism or office space which bemoans 

51
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:39,954
the drudgery of office work,
tps reports and that God be printer or 

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,510
whatever the hell is going on in Brazil.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,240
In the book,
the new spirit of capitalism,

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,163
Lucasville tanned skin.
Each sapelo call this modern time slash 

55
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,110
fight clubs slash office space style,
criticism of capitalism.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,033
The artistic critique.
It focuses on the loss of autonomy and 

57
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,240
creativity as opposed to critiques that 
focus on things like poverty or wages.

58
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,193
But what if all this complaining is just
making the system they rail against all 

59
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,574
the more resilient,
like our protagonists from black mirror 

60
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,540
or our second favorite,
rick,

61
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,420
and what if this isn't just something 
limited to fiction,

62
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,060
but the very real workplace?
Well,

63
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:19,894
we can answer that question with 
something that's more interesting than 

64
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,500
it sounds.
I promise.

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,513
Management theory.
Boltanski Sapelo observed a specific 

66
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,160
shift in management literature of the 
sixties and Seventies.

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,850
They were all complaining about workers,
bad attitudes and lack of motivation.

68
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,923
What they found is that your modern time
style artistic critique was actually 

69
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,364
affecting economic output workers 
completely unstimulated by the lack of 

70
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:46,390
autonomy or creativity or slacking off 
or worse,

71
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:47,890
not even bothering to show up.

72
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,330
Furthermore,
in France,

73
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,164
at least all the talented college grads,
we're no longer interested in goal 

74
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,914
middle management positions.
Boltanski Sapelo named their book after 

75
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,740
one by sociologist Max Faber.
Faber asks,

76
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,830
how do you get people to buy into a new 
economic system?

77
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,410
Well,
if your religion thinks that you need to

78
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,980
work hard until you die,
otherwise you'll go to hell.

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,160
Then it's a pretty great partner for 
emerging capitalism,

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,320
especially if you got to do this all 
day.

81
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,603
The spirit of capitalism is what engages
people with capitalism in the sixties 

82
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,240
and seventies.
That old spirit was failing.

83
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,253
People wanted less fire and brimstone or
even good union jobs and more free love 

84
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,354
and drugs,
so Boltanski and Sapelo ask what's the 

85
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:34,600
new spirit?
The new spirit of our modern era engages

86
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,970
people on the grounds of things like 
autonomy,

87
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,200
creativity,
and freedom,

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,670
but it's still the same system.
The people are still biking all day,

89
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,504
living meaningless lives,
but at least they have been show to 

90
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:51,211
express their frustration for them.
Likewise,

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,810
you still have to work 12 hour shifts at
subway,

92
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,840
but at least you're now considered a 
sandwich artist,

93
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,003
but going beyond this,
what can we make of resistance in the 

94
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,094
new spirit of capitalism?
Do we culturally need a critique of the 

95
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,940
artistic critique?
Let's go to one of my favorites network.

96
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,390
It's like 15 million merits.
The movie after learning,

97
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,070
he's about to be fired.
News anchor,

98
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,890
Howard beale announces his on air 
suicide.

99
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,610
I'm going to blow my brains out right on
this program a week from today,

100
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,623
which he cynically remarked will make 
his dwindling ratings go through the 

101
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,110
roof,

102
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,790
going to get a hell of a writing out of 
that.

103
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,190
Then in a pseudo apology,
he says,

104
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:37,150
he just ran out of bolts and rants about
the horrid state of the world.

105
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,790
Hi,
I'm mad as hell.

106
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm not going to take this anymore.
His public meltdowns become so popular.

107
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,523
He's reinstated bringing unprecedented 
ratings and therefore money to an 

108
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,754
otherwise small network.
The network also creates the mouse a 

109
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,054
tongue.
Our were a bonafide member of the 

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,620
Communist Party preaches revolution.

111
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,710
I'm lorraine,
so bad ass Cami

112
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,300
culminating in one of my favorite lines 
in cinema.

113
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,760
I mean,
that's why it's not going to see a Nigga

114
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,840
goddamn show until we go and its 
indication.

115
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,810
The producers of network rightly 
perceive that the capitalist model is no

116
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,510
longer about conformity.
Allow modern times,

117
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,980
but about rebellion and disillusionment.
Those are the things that sell.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,290
They turned off,
shot up,

119
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,180
and they themselves limp and nothing 
helps.

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,900
The American people want somebody to 
articulate their rage for them.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,820
Verbal Tansky and Chappelle existential 
rebellion,

122
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,800
Marxist critique and revolutionary ideas
have basically become the official style

123
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:31,634
of contemporary capitalism,
and you thought I meant that 

124
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:37,010
figuratively.
Perhaps nothing encapsulates this better

125
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:37,844
than the rick and morty episode,
the Rick Way to mix up for a bunch of 

126
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,400
bricks,
toil away in a dehumanizing factory only

127
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,610
for an act of rebellion to be repackaged
into wafers.

128
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,200
They give you the taste of the unique 
flavor of shattering the grand illusion.

129
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,920
We might consider media like network 15 
million merits and simple.

130
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,440
Rick's as the critique of the artistic 
critique.

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,130
Why bother railing against the 
alienating nature of the system and it's

132
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,230
just gonna help someone else's bottom 
line.

133
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,483
Sometimes it's not just cooptation.
Some media imagines a world where the 

134
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:11,510
alternative to the system is just as bad
as the system itself.

135
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,070
In Fight Club,
for instance,

136
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,760
men who complained about the degradation
they face in their daily lives.

137
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,683
My two grown kids wouldn't even return.
My phone calls eventually go on to join 

138
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,230
an organization where they have no names
in project may have.

139
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,073
We have no names are called maggots,
maggots and routinely run the risk of 

140
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,620
getting their balls cut off.
These guys are going to take your boss.

141
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,513
Why did the men in fight club go from 
being in masculine and under capitalism 

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,400
to being literally emasculated by their 
new dictator?

143
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,490
If anyone ever interferes with project,
may even you got to get us balls because

144
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,430
sometimes even our ideas for resistance 
come from the system itself.

145
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,593
Other times,
the resistance is literally created by 

146
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,504
the system to ensure its survival.
Consider everyone's favorite trench 

147
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,960
coat.
Jesus neo the first matrix makes it seem

148
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,794
like neo is a classical savior.
Come to liberate the humans from their 

149
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,800
enslavement to the machines and awakened
them from their illusions,

150
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,480
but we eventually learn in one of the 
most pedantic monologues of all time.

151
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,403
That neo is just a product of the very 
system he wants to undo morpheus desire 

152
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:23,984
on even the prophecy are just part of 
the way the system tries to tame the 

153
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,740
human capacity for free will and use it 
against them

154
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,070
and we have become exceedingly 
efficient.

155
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,170
So

156
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,260
freewill doesn't help folks find ways 
out of the system.

157
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,490
The system accounts for freewill and 
channels that to the machines benefit,

158
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,560
so pretty bleak,
right?

159
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,663
We can't escape the system.
Some resistance actually comes right 

160
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:53,101
from the system and the Matrix sequels 
still shutting.

161
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,853
We be crying in a corner and not 
consuming more media about 

162
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,214
disillusionment.
If we fetishize durden's face on t 

163
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,170
shirts,
haven't we missed the point entirely?

164
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,110
Things you'll end up owning.
Well,

165
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:11,040
there are some movies that move to 
address this problem in snowpiercer.

166
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,874
Survivors of Earth's new ice age,
live on a train organized along class 

167
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,770
lines,
the richest in the front,

168
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,300
the poorest in the back,
the poor stager,

169
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,153
rebellion,
and reach the front only to discover 

170
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:26,190
that the revolt was orchestrated by the 
trains leader to thin the population and

171
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,290
ensure sustainability.
At first,

172
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,870
it seems not unlike our previous 
examples,

173
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,823
but the rebels decide that they would 
rather crash the train and start all 

174
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:36,750
over.

175
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,930
Ben Settle for these simple taste of 
shattering the grand illusion.

176
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,123
Does this mean that the only way to 
escape the system is to burn the world 

177
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,060
down?
Well,

178
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,420
not necessarily in the recent comedy.
Sorry to bother you.

179
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,900
We see a third option in this film star 
Telemarketer,

180
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,734
Cassius Green inhabits a darkly familiar
world where not even leaked footage of 

181
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,940
human slash horse hybrid slaves can 
prompt revolution,

182
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,953
but instead earns a fist bump from the 
stock market and praise from scientists 

183
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,154
and investors get it.
Capitalism is literally dehumanizing 

184
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,290
folks by turning them into equine 
people,

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,780
and that's still not enough for a wakeup
call.

186
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,360
In some ways,
maybe this holds a mirror to us.

187
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,680
We respond any better when we hear about
Amazon workers pissing and bottles.

188
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,753
Not always.
The film ends with a successful union 

189
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,440
strike that makes our protagonist life 
markedly better.

190
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,730
Even though the film is a very skeptical
about escaping the system entirely,

191
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,623
it seems to place a lot of hope in these
slow struggle to incrementally improve 

192
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:35,100
it.

193
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,250
So what do you guys think wise crack.
Should we crash the train?

194
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,173
Is there room for slow change or do 
simple rig wafers tastes too good to 

195
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:46,740
risk it worth it,
and for prime examples of not being able

196
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:47,574
to escape the system,
consider this whether you want to break 

197
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:50,784
out of the routine of a nine to five job
or whether you just want to expand the 

198
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:53,934
boundaries of your abilities.
