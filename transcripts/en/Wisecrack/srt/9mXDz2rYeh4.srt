1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,720
What's up wise,
crack jared,

2
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:09,070
eternally trapped in your computer here.
Self-Aware humor is all around us.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,140
Deadpool cabin in the woods and even 
galaxy quest are all well loved and it's

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,070
easy to see why they make fun of the 
very genres they inhabit and they're all

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:23,071
part of a growing trend of media that 
makes fun of well itself be a superhero.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,293
Listen,
the day I decided to become a crime 

7
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:29,850
fighting swindler who rooms with a bunch
of other little whiners at the Neverland

8
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:34,320
mansion of some creepy old bald heaven's
gate looking mother.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,083
On that day,
I'll send your shiny happy as a friend 

10
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,380
request

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,870
and since this trend isn't going away 
anytime soon,

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,280
we thought we'd give you a little primer
on the complex nature of self criticism.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,330
So in order to gain elevated insight on 
how we get on the world around us,

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,620
let's explore the ever so important 
distinction between satire and parody.

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,000
Both satire and parody exists to 
criticize the world and hey,

16
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,800
that's like my number one favorite thing
to do,

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,933
but like all things,
there's a lot of bad satire and bad 

18
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:05,444
parody today.
We're going to figure out the heart of 

19
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:08,690
what each is with two wisecrack,
crack,

20
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:09,860
faves,
watchman,

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,753
and one punch man.
So join us as we dive deep into the 

22
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,024
nuances of their respective genres so 
that we can appreciate these amazing 

23
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:18,320
properties,
even more.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,240
This wisecrack condition on parody and 
satire with watchman and one punch man.

25
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,290
And as always,
spoilers ahead and we'll be using images

26
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,540
from the watchman movie and the graphic 
novel.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,230
So please don't freak out.
But before we get into it,

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,690
want to give a quick shout out to 
alliance heroes of the spire who enabled

29
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:38,360
us to make this video today.
Alliance heroes are the spire,

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,680
you actually got to work for your winds 
here.

33
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,330
People,
real time Pvp,

34
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,164
crazy bosses,
and an insanely high number of hero 

35
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,180
combinations.
Make this the game to play during work.

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,380
No,
not that I do that.

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,050
Plus you get the rec tons of bosses,
just like an anime.

38
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,980
Click on the link below to download the 
game for free and you'll also get 50,000

39
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:01,814
gold and 50 gems on the house.
Have you ever owned that much gold in 

40
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:06,080
your life?
I sure haven't.

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,410
Thanks again to alliance here is with 
the spire and now back to your regularly

42
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:10,310
scheduled geek out.

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,790
Let's start with a refresher course in 
alphabetical order.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,833
One Punch man follows cytoma a hero 
capable of defeating any enemy in a 

45
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:20,450
single punch.
On the flip side,

46
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:23,090
we've got watchman,
a story that asks the question,

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
what if superheroes were just people 
like us?

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,000
Which is to say,
before we get into categorizing,

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,160
let's talk about what these stories have
in common.

50
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,203
Most clear is their willingness to take 
the archetypes of their respective 

51
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:35,684
genres and twist them around.
One Punch man takes an animate trope 

52
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:39,884
like magical girls.
I'll off sailor moon and distorts it 

53
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,034
with a swole ex convict.
There's also the familiar hardworking 

54
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,934
every man hero,
but he's just a De buffed version of 

55
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,024
Toku hero common writer.
And of course we have a Goku s world's 

56
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:53,894
savior,
but he looks like a low rent Halloween 

57
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,580
costume attached to an egg.
On the watchman side,

58
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,850
we've got an army of Superhero 
knockoffs.

59
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,803
Both roar shack and Ozymandias are 
distillations of certain elements of 

60
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,480
Batman.
Ozymandias says the charismatic,

61
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,314
rich and hyper intelligent Bruce Wayne.
The force of good that the world needs 

62
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,140
clean cuts and above the fray.
Roar Shack,

63
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:14,974
on the other hand,
is the detective Batman fighting crime 

64
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,390
and searching for truth with a capital 
t,

65
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,240
much like the world's greatest detective
[inaudible] shacks,

66
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,074
quest for truth and justice fears 
dangerously close to a horrifying 

67
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,064
obsession.
He's like the ugly version of Frank 

68
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,840
Miller's take on the Cape Crusader and 
for good measure,

69
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,674
there's night owl,
a recreation of the nerdy inventor 

70
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,940
version of Batman,
Allah,

71
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,770
Adam West,
and his shark repellent.

72
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,173
Both stories use these twisted up 
versions of recognizable characters to 

73
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:46,690
make observations about what we take for
granted and supercrew stories.

74
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,780
The types of heroes we see,
what we expect them to do,

75
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,810
and what we think motivates them to 
shoot.

76
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:55,590
Oh,
you know,

77
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,420
10 of them done by changing up what 
we're used to.

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
The departure from the original tropes 
sticks out like a sore thumb.

79
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,680
In both stories,
this contrast explores what we'll call a

80
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:08,200
more realistic version of superhero 
power.

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,680
What is having God like power really 
like to find out?

82
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:15,820
Let's turn to a pair of hairless wonders
site Toma and Doctor Manhattan.

83
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,073
While a pair of galactically powerful 
heroes isn't exactly the kind of thing 

84
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,524
you'd see in real life,
they're reaction to power very much is 

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,273
both Cytoma and doctor Manhattan 
confront the boredom afforded by 

86
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:31,180
omnipotence site to must spends his time
mourning his lack of a true challenge.

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,270
While doctor Manhattan mostly has weird 
sex,

88
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:42,130
hangs out on Mars and contemplates the 
nature of time despite their vast power,

89
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,083
neither is a traditional protagonist 
like that man or Goku because neither 

90
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:46,954
one struggles in a traditional way.
While Goku has to train with King Kai 

91
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,420
and sprint along passages between 
worlds.

92
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,383
Cytoma just does some pushups.
Batman puts together clues to solve 

93
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:57,604
mysteries.
Doctor Manhattan literally knows 

94
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,950
everything and Community Jack

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,033
wants me to look into my future.
See if the colors that were publicly 

96
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,564
identified,

97
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,980
where do you see the stories about good 
guys overcoming the odds,

98
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:11,814
but for site and doctor Manhattan,
physical confrontations are over before 

99
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:16,134
they start.
Doctor Manhattan one the Vietnam War by 

100
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,374
himself and cite them up,
beat up an alien that searched entire 

101
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:26,880
galaxies for a worthy adversary without 
ever even giving it his full effort.

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Well done.
[inaudible] Motor,

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,940
the hung a tote on Oca.

104
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,493
So what is the one critical difference 
between the method of one punch man and 

105
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:39,394
watchman?
Watchman is a satire and one punch man 

106
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:42,934
is a parody.
While one is ultimately an adoration of 

107
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,354
the genre,
it lovingly pokes fun at the other is a 

108
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,234
burn it all approach.
So the heroes who used to cover our 

109
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,324
jammies according to satire,
a critical reintroduction by Dustin 

110
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,243
Griffin,
org of is designed to attack vice or 

111
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:00,524
folly.
It seeks to persuade an audience that 

112
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,990
something or someone is reprehensible or
ridiculous.

113
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,420
When it takes over another literary 
structure,

114
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,040
it tends not to just borrow it,
but to subvert it or direct its energies

115
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,420
toward alien ends.
Watchmen as a satire doesn't just attack

116
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,750
the vices and follow these up society 
and the superhero genre.

117
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,673
It's specifically assaults,
the idea of anyone possessing powers 

118
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,720
that even approach that of a nuclear 
weapon.

119
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,110
It's largely about nuclear fear only 
this time,

120
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:30,944
it's not just directed at a bomb,
but a blue skinned super being John 

121
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,610
Osterman becomes doctor Manhattan in a 
nuclear accident,

122
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,180
ease then recruited and used as a weapon
to win the Vietnam War.

123
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,110
Even his name is eight far from subtle 
reference to the Manhattan project.

124
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,890
He's fascinated by both time and clocks 
and throughout watchman.

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,940
We often see clocks counting down toward
undesirable outcomes.

126
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,670
In the graphic novel,
this is even clearer.

127
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,500
Nuclear security is referenced all the 
time and fear of nukes drives many kinds

128
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,334
of conflict.
The Vietnam War was a response to fear 

129
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,364
of nuke wielding Russians,
riots and violence on the home front in 

130
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,694
opposition to superheroes all returned 
to the fear of a nuclear threat 

131
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,460
symbolized by blue skin space wizard,
doctor Manhattan,

132
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,503
the Ussr and USA need a fabricated 
attack on earth to even set aside their 

133
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:18,914
differences,
exposing the extreme lengths taken and 

134
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:25,130
casualties sustained just to de escalate
the nuclear standoff.

135
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,780
Watchman shows the dangers of power,
but also it's indifference.

136
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,733
Doctor Manhattan gets bored of 
everything and in his boredom becomes 

137
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,070
increasingly conflicted about the nature
of existence.

138
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,590
I prefer this.
Don't let here

139
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,900
[inaudible]

140
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,820
I am tired of earth.
He's people.

141
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,080
I'm tired of being caught in the tangle 
of their lives.

142
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,960
It's ultimately a grim joke about 
superman.

143
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,430
If he were really an all powerful being,
why would he worry about humanity?

144
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,583
In my opinion,
the existence of life is a highly over 

145
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:02,670
right.
This phenomenon,

146
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,380
it's even clear in his sartorial 
choices.

147
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,280
Superman rocks his costume to evoke the 
American values of truth,

148
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,780
justice,
and the American way.

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,980
While doctor Manhattan strips himself of
ideology and gets naked,

150
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,233
watchmen makes a more explicit point 
about the corrupting influence of power 

151
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:22,420
with the comedian.
Superhero stories ask us to believe that

152
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,240
the good guys with power are the ones 
who deserve it,

153
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:28,930
but watchman is more than willing to 
point out that they're not.

154
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,973
The comedian is a hero in the mold of 
Captain America or Wolverine and extra 

155
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,750
strong,
intelligent,

156
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:39,100
hyper capable super soldier,
but he's also a sadist psychopath.

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,353
Watchman isn't just making these 
observations to satisfy your brain's 

158
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:43,714
thinky parts.
It uses the form of the superhero genre 

159
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,290
like Batman clones and all powerful 
beings and the content of the story,

160
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,910
the try and persuade an audience,
but persuade them of what you might ask.

161
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Well,
there's certainly the problem of nukes,

162
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,073
but Griffin also says that satire wants 
to prove that something or someone is 

163
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,440
reprehensible or ridiculous,
and in this case,

164
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,530
that's something is the very idea of 
superheroes.

165
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,543
Watchman is dedicated to making the case
that the very existence of superheroes 

166
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,593
is a dangerous fantasy.
You can compare it to a classic work of 

167
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,810
satire.
Jonathan Swift's a modest proposal where

168
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,750
the author suggests solving famine by 
eating children,

169
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,750
of course,
which wasn't actually pro kid eating.

170
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,643
He was just trying to show the failure 
of society in his time and did so by 

171
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:29,784
inhabiting the form of a political essay
that overtly exhibits the indifference 

172
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:36,030
to suffering,
that characterize those in power.

173
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,283
Just as swift use the form of a 
political essay to make the people who 

174
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,320
write to political essays look like 
heartless monsters.

175
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,243
Watchmen uses the form of a superhero 
narrative to make superheroes look 

176
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:52,761
dangerous and it posits that superheroes
create an asymmetry of power that defies

177
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:54,714
regulations.

178
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,733
Superheros can violate the rules and 
commit acts of violence at their own 

179
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,364
discretion,
even if they have everybody's best 

180
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,244
interests at heart.
That degree of power inevitably becomes 

181
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:05,724
dangerous as different ethical frames 
allow roar shack and Ozzie Mandy has 

182
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,193
come into conflict,
whether it be super powers or nuclear 

183
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:13,974
powers,
that degree of power will inevitably 

184
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,854
lead to some ups.
Watchman can make these arguments so 

185
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,994
effectively because it uses the 
structure of superhero stories to make 

186
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,590
its argument.
Like Griffin says,

187
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,900
when it takes over another literary 
structure,

188
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,793
it tends not just to borrow it,
but to subvert it and direct its 

189
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:32,454
energies toward alien ends.
Every inch of watchman is dedicated to 

190
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,120
turning the traits we love about 
superheros against themselves.

191
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,283
And the end of the day,
watchman condemned superhero fiction as 

192
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,940
a genre because it promotes a dangerous 
fantasy.

193
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,400
But site to mum might want a word about 
that.

194
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,623
There's no doubt that one punch man is 
poking fun at superheroes of both Manga 

195
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,650
and western comics as well as the genres
themselves.

196
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,760
The villains in one punch man,
give intentionally over the top versions

197
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,140
of classic villain monologue.

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,520
No,
no.

199
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,300
We beat up on them.
But to know,

200
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,330
I mean that will pull the hallway on the
wheel.

201
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,590
Somebody [inaudible] you say 
[inaudible] [inaudible] every

202
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,890
character has a dramatic backstory.
Coy got cool.

203
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,110
What ain't no causal connection and a 
fighting spirit.

204
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,700
It uses anime and Manga tropes like 
ocean creatures,

205
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:38,060
swarms of people in suits,
hydro style monsters and more.

206
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,510
It's always in conversation with other 
works in the same genre,

207
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,030
but without the judgment we see in 
watchman.

208
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,930
Why?
Because one punch man isn't a satire.

209
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,660
It's a parody.
Now let's investigate the difference and

210
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:51,494
I promise it's more than just semantics.
We've already seen how satire has a 

211
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:59,080
specific persuasive function usually in 
opposition to something,

212
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,973
but parody isn't quite like that.
Parody exaggerate certain elements of 

213
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,594
its target,
but it ultimately affirms the literary 

214
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:11,410
form it in habits to be more specific.
Worsening to Robert videon and his essay

215
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,260
are parody and deconstruction secretly 
the same thing.

216
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,123
Parody excepts the logic and rules of 
its genre and takes them seriously as 

217
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:20,350
tools of its criticism.

218
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,070
As Finian says,
it operates from inside of the texts and

219
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,904
ideas it criticizes.
Think of how Genoese mirrors a classic 

220
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:28,594
animate protagonist.
He suffered a trauma and is trying to 

221
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,280
become strong enough to get revenge for 
the people he loves,

222
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,390
but at every turn he's rendered a joke 
by site.

223
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:39,270
Tim has immense power that doesn't 
diminish Genoese.

224
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:40,104
His appeal,
we can still relate to his desires and 

225
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,844
they aren't treated as stupid.
They're just irrelevant because cytoma 

226
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,750
has thrown all the rules out of whack.
All the things we mentioned before,

227
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,673
the tropes references,
even the structures of character arcs 

228
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:53,944
and stories are all classic Monga.
There's no doubt one punch man's 

229
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:01,480
creators truly love the genre,
but don't think it's above ridicule.

230
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,523
The show makes this argument by 
exaggerating the overpowered hero 

231
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,070
archetype in many Manga anime and even 
western comics,

232
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,060
no matter how powerful the villain gets,
the hero gets stronger to match.

233
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,450
Take Goku for instance,
enemies get stronger and stronger,

234
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,284
but Goku is always able to save the day.
Usually through some intense training 

235
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,620
regimen.
Dragonball z celebrates this,

236
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,860
but one punch man asks why there are you
and other characters.

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
Jenn Osen,
Moomin writer,

238
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,170
much like crillon or Yom Tra train hard 
to match their stronger friend,

239
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,110
but they never can and honestly don't 
need to.

240
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,243
The real hero will always be there to 
save the day by turning anime and Manga 

241
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,444
on their heads to make these points.
One Punch man is critiquing superhero 

242
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:44,284
stories by showing precisely where they 
double and collapse for a great example 

243
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,800
of where the lessons of superhero 
stories collapse.

244
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,723
Let's get back to Moomin writer.
He has a classic backstory and grows 

245
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,713
motivation.

246
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,300
Well,
mind you touch him.

247
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,560
He just wants to help people and be like
the heroes.

248
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,680
He looks up to Suny choosen.
He knew God,

249
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,943
not unlike Memoria for my hero academia 
and much like Muh Doria before he gets 

250
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,684
his powers.
Moomin writer constantly gets his ass 

251
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,920
kicked.
It's a message about real life.

252
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,813
Some people just don't have what it 
takes to be a superhero and telling 

253
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,340
everyone they can might get them 
seriously hurt.

254
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,520
We can see the same intrusion of reality
and Cytoma.

255
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,740
Most superhero stories end with the 
hero.

256
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,920
Happy to be saving the world and waiting
for the next challenge.

257
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,320
Site to Ma has a more relatable 
reaction.

258
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,453
Boredom,
there's nothing to overcome and that 

259
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,510
leaves you without a reason to get out 
of the bathtub.

260
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,060
This may sound like the satire rules so 
far,

261
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:46,840
but instead of trying to show something 
as reprehensible or ridiculous,

262
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,793
the crucial point for parody is that the
body of words is always pre loved and 

263
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,083
redirected.

264
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,820
Parody is used to awaken us to the flaws
and the things we love,

265
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,620
but not to demolish a flawed genre like 
watchmen aspires to do with superheroes.

266
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,540
One Punch man makes clear it's mocking,
animate to help expand the possibilities

267
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,374
of what it can do.
It's a complicated relationship mocking 

268
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:11,840
the things you love.
It can be hard to tell how to approach a

269
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,910
parotic text,
but according to fit in,

270
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,863
if we read parody straight as sincere 
expression without relating it to a 

271
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,780
structure of criticism,
we misunderstand it.

272
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,810
That's the key.
Parody is a tool for criticism,

273
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:24,644
but that criticism operates on the 
assumption that the genre it's 

274
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:27,794
criticizing is worth improving.
One Punch man calls on us to get away 

275
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,084
from the bigger monster,
bigger gun and find other stories to 

276
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,370
tell stories about chefs,
ice skaters,

277
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,790
and even Mahjong players opening up the 
possibilities of anime.

278
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,270
Storytelling is a noble goal and one 
that is sorely needed.

279
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,313
The ending of the show amounts to 
criticism of the dragon ball z model of 

280
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,490
storytelling.
Much like Goku.

281
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,330
Boreaus is constantly seeking the 
strongest opponents in the universe,

282
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,253
but unlike our say in hero,
he's willing to destroy innocence to 

283
00:15:56,971 --> 00:16:01,490
find the ones he wants at the same time 
site to match the actual strongest being

284
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,480
his board of all the power one punch man
is displaying both ways.

285
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,390
This infinite power model can fail.
Now,

286
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,224
it's important to remember that one 
punch man may criticize a certain kind 

287
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,434
of superhero narrative,
but it doesn't disavow the value of 

288
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,584
heroes.
The show wants us to recognize and 

289
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,330
emulate the bravery we see from Genoese 
and Moomin writer,

290
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,120
but also recognize the silliness of the 
story.

291
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:23,954
We find those lessons in.
That's the critical difference between 

292
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,890
one punch man and watchman.

293
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,933
Both use,
they're overpowered characters to make 

294
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,124
points about the genre they inhabit,
but watchman makes condemnations of all 

295
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:34,844
sorts of social systems beyond the 
context of superheroes and even 

296
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:41,990
condemned the superhero genre itself.
One Punch man feels different.

297
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,800
There's a general agreement that the 
stories we've told forever need a little

298
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:46,634
refresh,
but that doesn't mean abandoning them 

299
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,850
completely.
With that in mind,

300
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,700
we can label things like Chemo America,
Dr Strangelove,

301
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,390
and heather's as satire alongside 
watchman and Deadpool,

302
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:00,020
galaxy quest and blazing saddles as 
parody alongside one punch man.

303
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,710
And the Big Bang theory is none of these
things because that show,

304
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,660
and as always,
thanks for watching guys.

305
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,723
Nice.
