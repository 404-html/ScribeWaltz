What's up guys?

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,803
Helen here.
If you ask anyone to explain why they 

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:18,714
love Nathan for you,
they'll probably say some iteration of 

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,590
good.
Just have to watch it.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,740
Nathan fielder paints a bizarre picture 
of America,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,843
colored by strange individuals ranging 
from the verbally abusive private 

10
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,324
investigator.
You remind me of the wizard of 

11
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,094
loneliness to the ex con Santa Claus to 
the Stalker Esque Bill Gates 

12
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,380
impersonator.
On one level,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,550
Nathan's impossibly complex and 
nonsensical plans belie analysis,

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,000
but as you already know,
that's not gonna.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,650
Stop us because Paul,
all the insanity,

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,543
the show crackles with brilliant 
commentary holding up a mirror to the 

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,173
absurdity of running a modern business.
Welcome to this wisecrack addition on 

18
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,990
Nathan for you and sort of maybe kind of
spoilers ahead.

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,580
Here's the premise of the show and your 
typical episode of Nathan for you host.

20
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,414
Nathan fielder introduces us to one or 
more struggling business owners and 

21
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:08,660
proposals that cockamamie plan to 
improve their luck.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,733
You'll let minors purchase alcohol,
but then held it in a storage locker 

23
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,434
until their 21st birthday,
a plaza liquor would gain a ton of new 

24
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,990
underwriter customers.
Then we watch the plan escalate,

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,480
deviate,
and almost inevitably fail

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,680
for this mash up of retail and its 
history.

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,640
Try and wreck on the most basic level.
Many of the plots,

28
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:33,474
Nathan,
can reveal something about the strained 

29
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,700
relationship between morality and 
economic realities.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,713
To seriously are they talking about 
putting a banner that says we sell 

31
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
liquor to minors.
Nathan has described the way the series 

32
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,284
was born,
partially out of his own obsession with 

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,740
the 2008 economic collapse in which 
risky bank behavior took down the global

34
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:53,574
economy.
What really fascinated him was the way 

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,454
this cataclysmic fiscal rap was the 
result of thousands and thousands of 

36
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,743
seemingly mundane moments like when one 
guy must have known his boss's credit 

37
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:09,321
default swap magic was a bunch of woo in
nearly every episode of Nathan for you.

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,823
He makes us live through these kinds of 
sickening moments after he pitched and 

39
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,910
absurd sometimes immoral idea to a 
business owner.

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,410
The plan turned the job of moving into 
America's next fitness craze.

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,280
Watch each person reluctantly agreed to 
ideas that will likely mislead.

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,910
Exploit the labor of insult or terrified
customer.

43
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,163
I think you'll get a lot more people if 
they just think it's a workout and we 

44
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,300
don't tell them that they're actually 
doing free labor.

45
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,223
There's the antique store owner who 
tepidly extends her business hours to 

46
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,840
lauren drunk customers who are going to 
fall prey to the stores.

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,640
You break it,
you buy it policy.

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,820
I just wouldn't prefer a broken item.
I'd rather sell a good one,

49
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:48,654
but yeah,
I mean it would be the same thing no 

50
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,020
matter what happens.
So during each of these moments,

51
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,883
the owner's reluctance is palpable,
but it's typically eclipsed by their 

52
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,250
desire to improve their business to 
please Nathan.

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,690
Probably people will think that way.
Yeah.

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,180
Or simply just say on tv,
you know,

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,940
I want to see what,
how it works.

56
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,350
I would love to have this information 
and then if I have the use,

57
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,101
yes,
why not?

58
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,934
She was engaged.
Typically they'll justify it as a means 

59
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,050
of achieving bottom line profits 
anytime.

60
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,260
Removing any product.
It's always beneficial to stores in this

61
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,094
subset of Nathan's pranks,
watching decent human beings cajoled 

62
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:24,694
into small acts of immorality,
ranges from painfully uncomfortable to 

63
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,920
flat out on believable.
Okay.

64
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:30,960
You know the drill,
right?

65
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,530
It's the last stop.

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,133
Take the time.
Nathan convinces this man that he's 

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,170
being hired as a shell pr representative
enticed by the incentive of a good job.

68
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,570
The man is willing to say things like 
this.

69
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,310
This mill right here,
this building a relatively small.

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,560
If you had to have a spill somewhere,
you would want this.

71
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,360
Bill Mason

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,050
highlights the way a system that 
emphasizes personal gains at the expense

73
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:02,580
of community good sets up decent human 
beings to become their worst selves,

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,753
and these are for people that you cut in
front of that you thought you were 

75
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,540
better than including a nine year old 
girl.

76
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,743
Part of the strength of Nathan satire 
comes from the fact that each of his 

77
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:15,224
ideas have some real world basis.
He takes business antics that we're 

78
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,483
generally pretty comfortable with and 
transports them to a place of queasy 

79
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:23,970
moral,
including.

80
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,420
For example,
in the toy company episode,

81
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,300
he takes a familiar kind of advertising,
again,

82
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,143
targeted towards children owning a doin 
kid is now the only proof that you are 

83
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:38,360
not a baby here,
nice and reveals something uncomfortable

84
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,194
about businesses that stealthily exploit
or worst insecurities to get a piece of 

85
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,630
our hard earned paycheck.
Nathan,

86
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,464
for you showcases the struggle of the 
small business owner trying to compete 

87
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:49,814
in the global economy.
Subverting the narrative that anyone 

88
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:55,880
willing to work hard can simply pull 
themselves up by their own bootstraps.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,833
Nathan puts his own spin on the American
dream by first giving us the classic 

90
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:00,884
protagonist,
a hardworking cab driver or electronic 

91
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,760
store owner.
It's horrible.

92
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,520
I mean it's,
it's,

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,360
it's,
it's,

94
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,513
it's bad for small business and he 
paints his own presence as the savvy 

95
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:14,960
business consultant or the dose of luck 
they need to revitalize their business,

96
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,933
but maybe there's a shortcut to actually
having brand recognition using a little 

97
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,250
something called parody law.

98
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,143
What's the goal?
Isn't actually to help the businesses 

99
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:24,754
find success.
It's to underscore the absurdity super 

100
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:31,060
officiality and futility of modern day 
business in the first place.

101
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,223
For instance,
even when his scheme to make an 

102
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:34,354
elaborately orchestrated video,
that pig rescuing the golden a petting 

103
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,830
zoo go viral,
actually worked.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,500
He perversely left the zoo's name out of
the video.

105
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,330
I didn't want it to come across like an 
ad for the petting zoo.

106
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,223
I thought it'd be a bit transparent so 
that if people would have known that it 

107
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,830
was old tree village can be so selfish.
This

108
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,030
mistake is a gag that actually gets to 
the heart of the show's mission.

109
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,363
The short lifespan of any viral animal 
video pretty much ensures the fact that 

110
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,210
even if properly advertised,
the petting zoo would have quickly faded

111
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,870
back into cultural oblivion.
Nathan just expedited the process.

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,200
Even when Nathan's plans do succeed in 
the short term,

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,400
they're typically two implausible to 
survive in the longterm.

114
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,453
Los Angeles Health Department shut down 
dumb starbucks yesterday because it did 

115
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,234
not have proper permits.
Usually the business owner ends up 

116
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,593
exactly where they started and just 
maybe the show is highlighting the 

117
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:32,141
impossibility of going up against big 
business even when your plans are insane

118
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,493
and involve alligators.
This is never more clear than when 

119
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,290
Nathan attempts to take on a global 
brands.

120
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,573
In one episode,
he tries to help an electronic store 

121
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:46,490
owner compete with best buy.
Their sales are ridiculous.

122
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,380
I mean there's no way that I can 
compete.

123
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,333
Part of the problem is best buy's price 
match policy in which they promise to 

124
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:56,540
match any price from neighboring stores 
preventing anyone from underselling them

125
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,630
faith and proposes.
They use price match against the company

126
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,493
by offering to sell TVs for $1,
which would allow them to stock up on 

127
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:08,750
best buy's entire supply as expected.
Bestbuy finds a way out of it.

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,580
Why not?
They're not a competitor.

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,993
Of course,
at the same time that Nathan is trying 

130
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,710
to use best buy system to his advantage,
he and the small store owner,

131
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,553
I'm going to even more elaborate and 
absurd lengths to game their own 

132
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:23,730
customers,

133
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,563
printing out some flyers and 
distributing them throughout the 

134
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:27,174
neighborhood.
It was finally time for Alan to offer 

135
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,990
his $1 prices to the world,

136
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,090
obscuring their $1 TV's with a black tie
dress code and alive allocator.

137
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,030
After a failed ball suit and a staged 
reality show,

138
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,030
we ultimately hear the message loud and 
clear.

139
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,133
The international corporations can 
design rules that plunge small 

140
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,610
businesses into financial ruin.

141
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm just so sick and tired of these big 
companies like best buy and Ron thinking

142
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,640
that you know the rules don't apply to 
them,

143
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,693
not content to suggest that the hyper 
competitive business climate robs us of 

144
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:04,560
our morality and doomed to failure.
The show also explores the uncomfortable

145
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:08,400
relationship between modern business 
objectives and mortality.

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,870
To understand why this matters,
we have to examine the ideas of Pulitzer

147
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:15,090
prize winning.
Social Theorist Ernest Becker,

148
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,040
who saw the motivations behind our 
desire to acquire money as simply put,

149
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,700
are futile efforts to escape death as he
wrote in his book,

150
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,593
escape from evil money can be 
accumulated and passed on and so 

151
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,360
radiates its powers even after one's 
death,

152
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,493
giving one a semblance of immortality.
Nathan explores this relationship in 

153
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,294
several of his episodes taking the logic
of acquisition and the narcissism 

154
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,434
implicit in it and the plaza to the most
more bit of possible causes of funeral 

155
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,140
industry.
In one episode,

156
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,063
he convinced us a funeral home to offer 
a service in which the unpopular dead 

157
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,840
can hire actors to attend their funerals
so that they appear to be well liked.

158
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,000
This is the ridiculous albion logical 
extension of a consumer's world in which

159
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:03,200
we amassed objects and instagram likes 
in order to feel hip,

160
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,400
cool and validated,
but there's more in other episodes.

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,890
Nathan explores the uncomfortable 
aspects of monetizing the death.

162
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,970
He convinces a travel agent who only has
very elderly customers to start offering

163
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,804
funeral services to squeeze those 
customers for every cent before they 

164
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,960
quote.
He takes a very familiar logic,

165
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,943
diversifying your business,
and it makes it incredibly eerie by 

166
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,050
literally capitalizing off deaths.

167
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,123
This is a last ditch effort to squeeze 
out as much as you can from your 

168
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,170
customers before they're gone for good.

169
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,193
By applying a pretty banal business 
concept to the most ghoulish of 

170
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:44,370
circumstances,
Nathan exposes the inherit culturism.

171
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,820
Sometimes implicit in trying to upsell 
your customers towards the end,

172
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,693
it makes an attempt to save on the 
overhead costs of cremations by testing 

173
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:56,530
out the idea of using a wood fire pizza 
oven instead of a crematorium.

174
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,280
A few more hours.
Would it all just burned to a crisp?

175
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,213
Yeah.
Would that work the same for a human 

176
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:02,040
body?

177
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,873
At the same time,
there's actually a really strange 

178
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,560
hopefulness.
Insincerity to Nathan for you.

179
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,783
Think about it.
This is one of the very few reality 

180
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:11,934
shows in which the people depicted 
typically don't come across as crazy 

181
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,550
narcissistic jerks.
They're actually,

182
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,413
for the most part,
pretty sympathetic to show will often 

183
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,264
stall on strange moments of humanity 
even if it's somewhat disturbing like 

184
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:28,720
the gas station owners propensity for 
drinking his grandson's urine.

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,583
Bye.
I'm promoting because the ground 

186
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,200
grandsons peer sometimes help or these 
sexually experimental brothers,

187
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,400
so you guys are brothers

188
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,703
and you guys will have sex with the same
girl or the extremely ghost where a 

189
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:47,650
realtor would choked in Switzerland 
talking about earlier,

190
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:48,484
we are shocked by was by an entity.
Other times these displays of humanity 

191
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,470
are just really genuine.
Going to be okay.

192
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,553
The show highlights the tension between 
those slivers of humanity and the 

193
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,050
mandates of our modern economy.
For instance,

194
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,943
in one scheme,
Nathan sets his production assistant 

195
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,784
Solomon up on a date,
but agrees to have it sponsored by 

196
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,603
Quiznos,
so a quiznos rep is brought on standby 

197
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,280
to deliver branded dialogue in real time
for Solomon to say him say toasty.

198
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,373
Toasty.
This is a very self reflexive critique 

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,200
of the television industry as a whole,
which at the end of the day,

200
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,303
only makes money by padding it's 
gripping human dramas and comedies with 

201
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,710
commercial breaks every 10 or so 
minutes.

202
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,843
Furthermore,
if the show asks in a world over 

203
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,640
saturated with advertising,
how can we hope for a true connection?

204
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,793
It shows best through line.
Explores this question by depicting 

205
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:46,120
Nathan's ongoing quest to find love and 
friendship.

206
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,030
Whether Nathan's forcing auditioning 
actress to say,

207
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:53,680
I love you,
I love you again.

208
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,133
I love you

209
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,360
for asking a shopkeeper if he'd like to 
hang out to be rejected.

210
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,223
Would you ever want to hang out 
sometimes socially with me outside of 

211
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:04,820
this?

212
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,653
No.
Nathan's antics are hilarious because 

213
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,280
they're perfectly calibrated to turn 
people off.

214
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,050
He's the king of inopportunity hugs and 
misguided attempts at small talk.

215
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,210
If it makes it a little bit safer,
um,

216
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,090
would you be comfortable just being 
handcuffed,

217
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,003
listen,
enjoys letting his genuine 

218
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:26,520
vulnerabilities take center stage.
This is never more true than when Nathan

219
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:28,950
treats himself like a struggling 
business

220
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,813
and I know that as a TV host,
having a personality that people don't 

221
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:33,324
like is bad for business,
and that's why I needed to make a 

222
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:36,720
change.

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,110
Scheming to improve is desirability.
As a friend and lover,

224
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,230
he paints himself as the hunk on a 
meetup dating show.

225
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,590
He also conducts a focus group to 
improve his likability.

226
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,513
I think v-neck would go well with you,
have been brilliant and stages and 

227
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,400
elaborate scientific experiment to 
improve that.

228
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,290
Hanging out with him is fun.

229
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,790
So if their serotonin or dopamine levels
go up when they're hanging out with me,

230
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,740
that would mean that I'm fun

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,310
in treating human interaction like a 
business.

232
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,300
Nathan embodies the loneliness and 
isolation of our modern world.

233
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,663
At other times,
Nathan actually offers an answer with 

234
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,960
strange moments of genuine human 
connectedness throughout the series,

235
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,740
solidarity forms amongst a troop of 
rebates seekers who camp out with Nathan

236
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:19,574
on the mountain,

237
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
we agree with you.
The friendship that we gained here is 

238
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,030
just incredible,
so let's go down the mountain,

239
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,620
and

240
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,100
an oddly compelling relationship 
develops between Nathan antibodies,

241
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,550
most lovable sex worker facing happy 
birthday.

242
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,850
He's interactions are always mediated by
money.

243
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:36,684
On some level,
the rebate seekers are waiting for 

244
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,384
Nathan to get them their rebates and 
macy as being paid handsomely to hang 

245
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,940
out with him,
but glimmers of true curiosity,

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,833
affection and shared humanity shine 
through and it's really beautiful to 

247
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:50,190
watch.
It's adjusted.

248
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,024
Human connectedness is the bomb that can
make the current conditions of the 

249
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:55,980
modern world terrible.
Sometimes.

250
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:56,814
Nathan literalize is this thesis by 
sending the subjects of this failed 

251
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,534
schemes up on dates,
suggesting that there's economic 

252
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:07,350
situations could be bearable if only 
they had love and conclusion.

253
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,950
Nathan for you is a giant smirk holding 
a sign that says,

254
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,903
please love me.
It explores all the cynical motivations 

255
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,354
that govern us in dys,
ruthless era of startups and branded 

256
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,820
everything and hey,
at the end of the day,

257
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,780
maybe hanging out with the right group 
of Weirdos could be just the antidote.

258
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,720
Unique.
Thanks for watching everyone piece,

259
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,640
but since we all have to have a job,
you're gonna want to stay informed about

260
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:36,360
the world of business rather than 
getting bogged down by all those dents,

261
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,670
business news sites.
Consider cutting through the clutter.

262
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,400
With morning brew,
I used to work for a business journal,

263
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,330
so I've seen firsthand just how 
inaccessible some of those sites can be.

264
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,510

269
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,543
I'd already heard lots of great stuff 
about worrying brew and since I'm 

270
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:07,460
practically obsessed with following the 
shenanigans of big business,

271
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,070
I decided to give them a world and I've 
loved it.

272
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,040
Now everyday I wake up to news on 
Brexit,

273
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,350
what's going on with my shrink and 
bitcoin balance,

274
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,213
the latest outrage over Ilan Lusk,

275
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,744
fan girl and tons more.
