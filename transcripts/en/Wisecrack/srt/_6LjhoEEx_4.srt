1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,203
When you look at public opinion,
one of the clearest markers of how 

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,203
dramatically things have shifted as the 
number of people who say that they know 

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,560
an openly gay or lesbian person.
Uh,

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,423
back in 1985,
it was 24% of Americans who said they 

5
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:25,740
knew,
uh,

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,050
uh,
open gay or lesbian person,

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,190
uh,
by last year that had shifted up to 88%.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,140
And so,
um,

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,000
you know,
we actually dedicated the book,

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,770
it's a statistics book.
We dedicated the book to a,

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,613
an unknown number,
which is the number of people who have 

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,600
had the courage to come out.
Um,

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,440
and that's an impossible number to 
documenter or quantify,

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,510
but I think it is the starting point for
the revolutionary progress that has been

15
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,770
made.
Um,

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,653
you know,
Harvey Milk and other pioneers of gay 

17
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,514
and Lesbian Liberation made that basic 
point that coming out was a first step 

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
towards greater equality because 
visibility would lead straight Americans

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,540
to understand and accept and embrace and
an advocate for equality for lgbt folks.

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,070
And so this movement toward acceptance I
think is completely intertwined with the

21
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:27,261
growing visibility and the openness and 
honesty that lgbt folks have embraced.

22
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,050
The,
I do think data collection and,

23
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,290
and uh,
the dissemination of,

24
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,760
of survey results and polls,
um,

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,040
is really important.
Um,

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,110
at the same time,
I think,

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,100
um,
you know,

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,990
if we're talking about what the single 
most important factor might be in,

29
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:49,991
in terms of the revolution toward 
greater equality for lgbt people,

30
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,140
um,
I think you,

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,033
you got to look at the media and the,
the idea that media portrayals have 

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,170
shifted so dramatically.
Um,

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,760
that's one of my favorite chapters in 
the book actually.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,830
I'm the section on film and TV and other
forms of media,

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,693
um,
which when you look at early television 

36
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:13,260
portrayals in the seventies and 
eighties,

37
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,123
um,
there were occasional gay and lesbian 

38
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,224
characters,
but generally the laughing stock of any 

39
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,310
given show and the,
you know,

40
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,940
the very first gay couple,
um,

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,873
was on a norman lear a series called hot
l Baltimore about this hotel in 

42
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:28,794
Baltimore.

43
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,773
Um,
that program wasn't even broadcast in 

44
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,520
Baltimore and it was canceled after a 
handful of episodes.

45
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,190
And it was proceeded by this warning,
um,

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,771
you know,
to,

47
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:42,720
to make sure parents didn't allow their 
children to be corrupted by the,

48
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,450
uh,
morally questionable content.

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,553
And so you fast forward from that to 
something like will and grace or the 

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,940
ellen degeneres show where you have open
gay and lesbian characters.

51
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm actually living their lives and 
people can quibble.

52
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,400
Um,
and I think for good reason with some of

53
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,460
the portrayals.
But when you look at the overall trend,

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,353
just the very fact that mainstream 
television and network television is 

55
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,890
showing and embracing,
um,

56
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,310
healthy gay characters in committed 
relationships and a,

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,950
a really,
uh,

58
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,013
positive light.
I do think that has been fundamental to 

59
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,874
the changes we've seen.
And then I also think that the ongoing 

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,190
collection of data through organizations
like Gallup and the Williams Institute,

61
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,220
um,
is,

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,053
is also fundamental in terms of 
reminding people that there is this 

63
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,230
trend towards greater acceptance.
And I think one,

64
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:44,960
you know,
that,

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,793
that,
that growing acceptance as reflected by 

66
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:53,140
the numbers leads people to be more open
with pollsters.

67
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,380
So that if the Gallup's numbers on,
you know,

68
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,214
should same sex activity be legal as 
those numbers go up or should same sex 

69
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,380
marriage,
um,

70
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,170
be be illegalized as those numbers go 
up.

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,093
Um,
I think that reporting in turn 

72
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:14,281
encourages people to reveal their inner 
support.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,633
So there is a trend and a cycle whereby 
growing awareness and growing reporting 

74
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,420
of this awareness leads to greater 
acceptance.
