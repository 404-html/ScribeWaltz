00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,150
Hey,
wise crack jared,

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:04,984
as always,
so ubisoft recently reached out to us 

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:07,714
about doing something for the newly 
remastered version of assassin's creed 

4
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:13,090
rogue for ps four and xbox one.
Luckily for them,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,953
we've gotten a lot of assassin's creed 
requests over the years and luckily for 

6
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,034
us,
rogue has a unique perspective on the 

7
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:20,494
eternal struggle between the assassins 
and the templars and how it relates to 

8
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:26,320
the complicated nature of freedom 
throughout the series.

9
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,990
The value of freedom is placed above all
else.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,120
How are we in shall freedom public human
race,

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,983
the assassins were told are fighting the
good fight against those devious 10 

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,420
players who are trying to rule the world
with an iron fist.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,373
While freedom is nearly universally 
celebrated in society and Media Qb 

14
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:44,140
legally safe.
William Wallace knockoff.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,833
Yeah.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,093
Through which protagonists Shay Cormac,
assassin's creed rogue asked an 

17
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:54,730
interesting and unique question.
When does freedom go too far?

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,360
Welcome,
Liz.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,070
Wise,
crack condition on assassin's creed,

20
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,930
rogue remastered,
and as always,

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,850
minor spoilers ahead.
First,

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,713
a quick recap rope takes place around 
the numerically challenged seven years 

23
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,290
war and somewhere between black flag and
assassin's creed.

24
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,370
Three,
we follow fledgling assassin.

25
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,204
Shay Cormac,
a troublemaker who begins to question 

26
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:15,010
the assassin brotherhoods,
methods,

27
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,900
guards watching

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,900
to his dad looked disappointed,
sick of the way that looks it would have

29
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,750
been dead in a month.
Anyway,

30
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,883
he continues to struggle with defending 
his creed until halfway through the 

31
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,020
game.
He's given an assignment to find a piece

32
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,420
of ed or an ancient objects had to 
bestow God like power and wisdom because

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,240
pieces of Eden,
a powerful relics.

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,223
When Shay tries to retrieve it,
he triggers the infamous Lisbon 

35
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,630
earthquake of 1755 that killed 
thousands.

36
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,043
Despite what's happened in Haiti,
happened in Portugal or greater 

37
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,950
earthquake.
Thousands,

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,490
he confronts the assassins who deny 
culpability for the earthquake,

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,530
even though they were aware of the same 
thing,

40
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:01,860
had caused the devastating earthquake in
Puerto Prince five years earlier.

41
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,690
She argues that over here to this side,
what city funds decks,

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,730
but the assassin say we have the 
responsibility,

43
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,150
so shay flees the Brotherhood.
After being injured in his escape,

44
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,110
he's nurse back to health by an elderly 
couple who turned out to be templars.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,190
Shay is then recruited by the temp lars 
and send to kill his former assassin.

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,710
Brethren,
in most assassin's creed games were told

47
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,544
the templars are evil because they 
oppose freedom and the assassins are 

48
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:30,210
good because they fight for freedom,
which is best embodied in their mantra,

49
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,813
but assassin's creed rogue by showing 
the inner workings of both sides 

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,553
explores the paradoxical nature of 
freedom and the shortcomings of the 

51
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,510
assassins belief system.
Sure,

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,910
the assassin seen noble.
I mean after all,

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,390
you don their mantle as you fight 
against the corruption of the church and

54
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,224
histories other bad guys,
but just how benign is the saying when 

55
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,824
you consider the events of rogue,
the assassins disposition toward 

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,270
absolute freedom starts looking a bit 
questionable.

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,720
We can best understand why through the 
concept of positive freedom,

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,753
positive freedom is the freedom to do 
something and to self determine what 

59
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,054
that something is.
It's the freedom to choose to blast 

60
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,140
weird German techno whenever you want.

61
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,940
That's different than negative freedom.
The freedom from certain external forces

62
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,990
like the freedom from your roommate,
Brad telling you to stop blasting German

63
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,320
techno at 2:00
AM or brad common during your stereo.

64
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,610
The problem with unlimited freedom is 
that it often comes in conflict with the

65
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,444
rights and freedoms of others.
While you may be the master of your own 

66
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:34,894
fate,
what if your actions limit the freedom 

67
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,323
of others?
What if Brad can't be the master of his 

68
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,054
own destiny because he hasn't gotten any
sleep after the unceasing onslaught of 

69
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,180
Autobahn every night until 2:00
AM,

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,313
and if you reject any limitations on 
freedom from outside interferences or 

71
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
negative freedom,
who's going to step in to help Brad get 

72
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,450
some sleep?
If everything is permitted,

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,290
then people might not agree with when 
and how I want to listen to music.

74
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,390
The temple ours address this problem of 
freedom.

75
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,223
By negating it all together,
they in essence don't believe in the 

76
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:09,100
value of positive freedom.
That people can make their own decisions

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,083
or negative freedom,
that they should be free from despotic 

78
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,980
control.
Their philosophy is essentially that the

79
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:19,090
freedom of one person will always end up
rubbing against someone else's,

80
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,210
and so such freedom must be restricted.
Philosopher Isaiah Berlin highlights one

81
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,114
way in which these self determination of
positive freedom can have horrific 

82
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,344
results.
Freedom for Berlin can often be defined 

83
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:34,210
collectively with others groups,
tribes,

84
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:37,360
or even nations can set out to define 
their own destiny,

85
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,970
and that's where things get a little 
tricky.

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,953
Since in the name of collective freedom,
many have decided to repress minority 

87
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,154
groups.
The German people collectively yearned 

88
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,330
for the freedom to determine their 
national destiny,

89
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,523
but well,
we all know how that turned out for 

90
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,044
certain groups in Europe.
Now obviously the assassins and the 

91
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,300
Nazis are about as similar as Mozart and
Fred Durst,

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,193
but the assassins are willing to 
sacrifice the freedom of some for the 

93
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,970
sake of freedom for everybody.

94
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,103
If we're all free to do whatever the 
hell we want and the assassins don't 

95
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,674
mind.
Earthquakes killing thousands then is 

96
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,000
absolute freedom.
Really the ultimate good.

97
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,013
The templar seemed to understand this 
problem with positive freedom with 

98
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:20,710
people being their own masters,
so they try to actively suppress it.

99
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,370
In the name of a better world,
what marvelous destruction captain,

100
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,443
I saw the smoke all the way from the 
Morrigan that should discourage those 

101
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,104
Miss Greens.
New Yolk is safe for now and as rogue 

102
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:32,634
shows,
they're not as misguided as one may 

103
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,950
think.
Paradoxically,

104
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,813
certain rights and freedoms can be 
enhanced with a heavy hand from say the 

105
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,700
government or the templars.
So for instance,

106
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,150
by limiting someone's freedom to enslave
another person,

107
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,730
logging in states a better version of 
freedom,

108
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,623
not predicated on owning other humans.
We see this conundrum in other 

109
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:53,704
assassin's creed games such as black 
flag where the British templarios 

110
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:57,680
cracked down the pirates.

111
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,210
You play as in the name of safer sees 
and liberty for woodby pirate victims.

112
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,283
The templars believe they know best and 
that order can be achieved through 

113
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,494
guidance and rule.
But this isn't exactly a perfect 

114
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,260
ideology either.
The total control of individuals for the

115
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:16,430
sake of greater good can lead to your 
typical big brother Dystopian nightmare.

116
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,473
So while causing earthquakes,
stealing fortunes and slitting throats 

117
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:25,340
is okay.
If nothing is the polar opposite is that

118
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,820
we should all be thanking our masters 
for living under a Jack boot,

119
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,650
but hey police,
they're open about it.

120
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,693
What makes rogue unique is that shade 
distances himself from the dogmatic 

121
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,074
belief structures that characterize the 
protagonists of previous games and 

122
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,810
embraces a rationally informed moral 
choice,

123
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,900
but the shea make the right choice.
Well to figure that out.

124
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:45,734
We'll need help from one of the big dogs
of the European Enlightenment Manual 

125
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,304
Count during the enlightenment,
formulated a way to ground morality in 

126
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:57,320
reason instead of religion or custom 
known as the categorical imperative.

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,020
So let's see how Shay's decision stacks 
up.

128
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,033
The first formulation act only according
to that maxim whereby you can will that 

129
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:08,990
it should become a universal law sort of
boils down to do unto others.

130
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,890
So if you want to know if killing people
and then searching their bodies for loot

131
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,783
is moral,
you should consider what will happen if 

132
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,393
everyone follows this rule.
The second is to act in such a way that 

133
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:22,340
you treat humanity never merely as a 
means to an end,

134
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,010
but always at the same time.
As an end.

135
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,850
This essentially means that life is the 
highest value in and of itself,

136
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,710
so never harm others or exploit them as 
a means of achieving some bigger goal.

137
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,753
The final rule says that the will of 
every rational beings should be thought 

138
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,534
of as a universally legislating will.
This ties the first two together and 

139
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,944
suggest that there is a universal reason
or logic that we can all access through 

140
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,020
our own rationality.

141
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,640
It also offers a framework that includes
a sense of freedom since every person is

142
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,474
capable of participating in this kind of
moral reasoning where without the 

143
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,490
dangers of the templars of the 
assassins,

144
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,850
where people become freedom list ponds 
to their grander plans.

145
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,810
Even if paradoxically freedom is part of
that grander plan.

146
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,883
According to current,
no action or morals are ethical if they 

147
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:13,490
contradict these three rules.
So let's see how shay scores against the

148
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:14,324
assassins shade defects because he 
believed that by causing an earthquake 

149
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,300
and justifying it as part of their 
responsibility,

150
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,240
the assassins have done a grave 
injustice.

151
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,740
This act violates the first formulation 
because it implies killing thousands for

152
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,250
your own end,
which could never be a universal ethical

153
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,690
act.
One point for Shay,

154
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,703
zero for the assassin's the assassin's 
are also saying that those lives are 

155
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,500
acceptable sacrifices for their greater 
goal,

156
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,543
a violation of the second principle,
because using people as a means to an 

157
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,110
end is a big no,
no.

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,333
Another point for Shay,
and finally through their belief in 

159
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,664
total freedom,
the assessments are trampling on 

160
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,304
people's legislative will by ignoring 
their own agency and literally 

161
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:59,230
destroying their homes and autonomous 
lives which contradicts const.

162
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,310
Third formulation.
Shay wants no part of it,

163
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,000
so three points for Shay,
zero for the assassins.

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,953
So what can we learn from shades 
decision that fighting for freedom is 

165
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,410
not so simple by pursuing their own 
freedom,

166
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,960
the assassins have destroyed the 
freedoms of others,

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,770
but by rejecting the indoctrinated 
philosophy of nothingness,

168
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,460
Jay could be among the few ethical 
heroes of the assassins creed franchise.

169
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,510
Unfortunately for Shay,
the temple,

170
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:32,820
ours aren't exactly model citizens 
either in the name of regulating freedom

171
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:33,654
for the greater good,
the templars do plenty of deplorable 

172
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,954
things.
We see them helping local people in 

173
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,630
various places.
Now,

174
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,464
let us use some of that money for the 
good of the city and stopping the 

175
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,450
assassins from committing what amounts 
to a war crime.

176
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,450
There is an abandoned factory nearby,
how dangerous poison,

177
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,523
but we also see them lie,
maim and kill in the name of their own 

178
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:53,790
creed.
In the end,

179
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,683
the same sense of moral dubiousness 
follows the templars as much as the 

180
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:58,884
assassins.
When I am issued new recruits burdened 

181
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,320
with regrets,
I tell them the surest way to lose them.

182
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,660
He's with gunpowder with them both 
contradicting constant parative by using

183
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:13,710
people as a means to their own ends and 
killing those who stand in their way.

184
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,700
Assassin's creed rogues more nuanced 
exploration of freedom,

185
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,200
good and evil is a welcome addition to 
the series Shay's decision to betray the

186
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,080
assassins,
brings the philosophies of both factions

187
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,980
under scrutiny and makes the player view
each in an entirely new life.

188
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,130
Was this moral ambivalence about freedom
always there.

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,620
Have we been playing as the bad guys?
All along,

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,633
here's to hoping.
This complex question gets explored in 

191
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:39,660
future installments,
but until then,

192
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,494
be sure to check out the remastered 
version of assassin's creed rogue out
