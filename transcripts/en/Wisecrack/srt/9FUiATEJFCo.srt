1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,440
A wise crack,
live action.

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:08,340
Jared here these days,
social media means everything we do ends

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,174
up on permanent record.
Just being on the Internet is a 

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,570
minefield and there's no survival guide 
for handling.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,100
We're not the only ones worrying about 
it either.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,730
As the newest episode of Southpark 
tackles these ideas head on.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,440
So let's get into this quick take on 
season 21 episode three holiday special.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,513
And as always,
spoilers ahead if you've been listening 

9
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,410
to our ourself park podcast,
respect our authortalk,

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,363
you know that we've been fascinated by 
the fact that this season has been more 

11
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,024
focused on people's reaction to world 
events rather than the events 

12
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,384
themselves.
This has never been more clear than in 

13
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:45,030
this past episode.
Holiday Special Randy's quest for social

14
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:47,520
justice hits a lot of ideas right on the
nose,

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,600
but it also raises some really 
interesting questions.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,220
First,
a quick recap.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,360
Randy caught up and yet a nother wave of
activism gets Columbus State canceled,

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,343
which means no more day off school,
but that's still not enough for south 

19
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:07,380
park's most vocal father.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,020
He sets off to tear down a statue of 
Columbus,

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,770
takes a crap and Columbus circle and 
berate the residents of Columbus,

22
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,510
Ohio.
You're an intolerant pig.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,973
Oh,
you're not.

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,903
You just choose to live in a city named 
for ethnic cleansing is activism keeps 

25
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,450
escalating until the kids discover a 
treasure trove of instagram.

26
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,270
Pictures depicting randy in Columbus 
play.

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,090
After that,
randy goes to great lengths,

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,953
including falsifying a DNA test in the 
randy way possible to inoculate himself 

29
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,630
against criticism by presenting himself 
as a native American,

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,441
I.
E.

31
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,570
A descendant of Columbus.
These victims.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,613
In the end,
randy finds out that he's just an 

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,653
average white dude of European descent,
but with more than average amount of 

34
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,974
neanderthal DNA,
a fact he spins into his own story of 

35
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:53,634
victim hood.
The earth wasn't big enough for the 

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,670
Andrew.
Thoughts to your ancestors.

37
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,504
Just got rid of them up after all those 
brutal homo sapiens for race 

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,460
neanderthals from the face of the earth.

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,880
So what does Randy's quest tell us about
the world we live in?

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,193
Well more than you might think and to 
explain why we're turning to something 

41
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,540
that we talked about in one of our 
walking dead videos.

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,553
The pen off the con,
the panopticon is an idea originally 

43
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:16,674
created by philosopher Jeremy Bentham.
It's a prison where a single guard in a 

44
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:20,934
tower can watch all the inmates at once.
The prisoners can't tell if they're 

45
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,194
being watched,
so they have to always be on their best 

46
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,830
behavior.
But postmodern theorists,

47
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,664
Michel Foucault,
thought it was a perfect metaphor for 

48
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,214
how society controls that citizens,
because we never know when our actions 

49
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:39,450
might result in punishment.
We try our best to follow the rules,

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,403
which means we'd become controlled by 
those rules even when no one enforces 

51
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,304
them.
We even internalize those rules and 

52
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:48,120
systems,
so we don't know if we're acting because

53
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:52,200
of our beliefs or because of that 
systemic control and fear of punishment.

54
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,423
Unfortunately for Randy,
social media has become a kind of real 

55
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,574
life panopticon don't post that.
Everything we do exist on the Internet 

56
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,114
for forever and because of that,
we all have to be careful with what we 

57
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,690
do and what we say online.
Randy feels this in a very real way.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,553
When the kids discover his prior 
predilection for Columbus because he's 

59
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,214
always being watched,
randy has internalized his fear of 

60
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,484
punishment and his desire to live up to 
social ideals as a means of creating 

61
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:22,120
social capital.
You guys found those pictures online.

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,310
It's only a matter of time before 
everyone else does.

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,743
People won't care about what I do now.
They'll just see me as a thoughtless 

64
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,240
indigenous son of a bitch.
In other words,

65
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,074
as a perpetual band wagoner,
randy needs to be a guy who protest 

66
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,080
Columbus because that's what he thinks 
society wants from him,

67
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,123
but with the advent of the Internet,
he's constantly terrified of what his 

68
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,080
peers might uncover about his past.

69
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,063
Once the points Sharon,
soon they're going to become an 

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,220
afternoon.
With social media,

71
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,560
our culture is evolving faster than 
ever,

72
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,543
but it's also becoming or judgmental 
mistakes made in the past are looked at 

73
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,074
through the lens of the present.
Just because he's suddenly not cool now 

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,850
doesn't mean I'm going to be the scape 
goat.

75
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,923
This goes for both Columbus who 
definitely did horrible things and 

76
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,640
randy,
who's just kind of an idiot.

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,713
It's only now when everyone's being so 
indigenous to me that I realized how 

78
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:16,690
indigenous I've been acting all along.
Randy tries to explain that he's changed

79
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,060
that what he did in the past shouldn't 
matter.

80
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,380
Look,
I was younger,

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,813
we were all young.
There was another time you have to 

82
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:28,360
understand it was 2013 two bad for 
randy.

83
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,810
There's no codified statue of 
limitations on bad behavior.

84
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,913
Randy gets caught acting in the past 
with ways not entirely kosher with the 

85
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,520
present.

86
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,330
He can't be an advocate for a cause.
If he's seen as disingenuous and sends,

87
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,880
Randy defines himself by his project of 
the week.

88
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,260
He can't afford to let that happen and 
because social media judges all action,

89
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,920
we often fetishize purity when it comes 
to social issues.

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,900
Yeah.
How I'm from New York,

91
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,933
I drive around a big circle that 
celebrates a guy who murdered native 

92
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,240
Americans.
Luckily for Randy,

93
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:02,260
he stumbles across the commercial for 
appears to be a perfect solution.

94
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,363
DNA in me.
Wouldn't you like to know the story of 

95
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,700
you?
What makes you you?

96
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,920
The DNA testing program lets people 
claim affinity with marginalized groups.

97
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,310
I'm on cell part,
northern Asian and even some Kurdish.

98
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,970
I'm a victim of oppression.
Even if they aren't apparently a part of

99
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:23,290
them DNA and be showed I was 8% Navajo,
nobody making fun of me.

100
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,420
Now are my people who are victims.

101
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,373
The ability to claim victim hood enables
people to stake out a moral high ground 

102
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,930
and make themselves immune from 
criticism.

103
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,660
Are you in health?
Yes,

104
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,494
I'm in.
Now the irony of this is a course that 

105
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:37,894
most people who need a DNA test to find 
out if they're victims of oppression 

106
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,860
probably are not oppressed.
I'm 13% victim.

107
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,700
I'm 21% victim to protect himself from 
potential fallout.

108
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,990
Randy pays a native American to make out
with him in order to guarantee he'll end

109
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,020
up with the DNA of an indigenous person.
In doing this,

110
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,854
randy demonstrates and indifference 
toward the feelings of the native 

111
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,340
American man who ends up falling in love
with him.

112
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,543
I have never felt so alive and tone and 
even managers to recreate the misdeeds 

113
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,800
of Columbus all over again.
You get off my land,

114
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,634
you'll pay.
This all adds up to show that randy's 

115
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,500
political aspirations are ultimately 
selfish.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,180
He's so desperate to claim victim hood 
and so utterly ill informed about pretty

117
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,390
much everything that he leans on his 
2.8%

118
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,224
neanderthal DNA.
They claim that his people were erased 

119
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,890
from history.
Yeah,

120
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,724
sure.
Everyone gang up on the neanderthal 

121
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,940
visited.
Funny again,

122
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,640
Randy's bizarre behavior raises 
something important.

123
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,970
How do we decide when people can claim 
victim hood?

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,170
That's not to minimize the suffering of 
anyone,

125
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,023
but how do we distinguish between people
who are legitimately effected by a 

126
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:44,864
legacy of oppression and this guy,
I used to get in trouble for always 

127
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:50,450
using the n word,
but with DNA and me,

128
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,170
I found out that I'm 2.1%
black morning Steve,

129
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,120
stop.
Where's the line?

130
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,163
How close do you need to be on the 
family tree for oppression to be passed 

131
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,510
down?
Certainly a thousand years is too much,

132
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,880
but what about a hundred years or 50 
years?

133
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,760
Even five.
It's a complicated debate,

134
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,743
but we know exactly what randy thinks 
even tens of thousands of years is fair 

135
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,310
game.

136
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,143
All these ideas add up to one compelling
20 minute critique of how we approach 

137
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,200
politics in the age of social media.
Questions of how we deal with our public

138
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,034
lives being saved online,
how we treat past mistakes and how we 

139
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,784
understand victimhood in our hyper aware
era are ones that we need to answer and 

140
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,930
South Park knows that until we resolve 
all of that,

141
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,913
there'll be a whole lot of misguided 
randy's running around and causing 

142
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:37,784
chaos.
That's what the show is ultimately 

143
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:39,914
saying.
We need to figure out how we talk to 

144
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:42,524
each other about history and complicated
ideas of culture or else we'll just be 

145
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:49,490
crossing wires,
making messes and in public places.

146
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,713
The 21st season of south park wants us 
to think how we handle an increasingly 

147
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:58,040
complicated world that demands faster 
and less nuanced reactions.

148
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,900
You have to Overdo it in today's 
society,

149
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:00,734
Stan,
you can't be nuanced and subtle anymore 

150
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,230
else.
Critics go,

151
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,460
wow,
what was the point of that?

152
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,160
The show doesn't have answers though and
neither do we,

153
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,203
but the first step is asking questions.
If you want to hear these questions 

154
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,210
explored further,
