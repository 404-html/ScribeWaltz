1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,120
Was having a baby this week on thought 
nosebleeds,

2
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:15,060
straight clown and with it by Stephen 
King movies.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,990
Gabs bad of me.

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,020
No,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,310
you better recognize it's this big ass 
book.

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:27,311
Always jumping across two time periods,
but since town like that will be a bit.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,710
I'm going to land on your chronological 
age.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Nineteen 57 and it's random balls in the
town of Derry man.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,463
One little shorty George playing with a 
paper boat made by his older brother 

10
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:44,861
bill so that both flow into the storm 
drain where man,

11
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,010
they got some weird crackheads and 
dairy.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,993
Anyway,
George tried to snatch that boat back 

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,410
from the cloud.
Spray rip him off.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,233
He did three months go by and the boy 
named Ben Rolling back to the crib when 

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,700
hold up that same red nose,
Hayden,

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,683
the clown ass.
If you want to grab a balloon and chill 

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,780
and Ben's tempted,
but he say,

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,623
Nah,
I'm straight and the cloud to a damn 

19
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:17,261
mommy and ben like books.
The bench on a duck,

20
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:19,310
a thug name,
Henry bowers,

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,140
and it's cooler gangbangers by laying 
low in the barons where you become tight

22
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:29,141
with homies who also getting their ass 
whooped by Henry George older bro.

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,520
Bill and his cat,
Ben,

24
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,493
Bill and Addie got already in a dam with
some other young bloods name Richie and 

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,620
stands rob by.
Turns out most of them is seeing I clown

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,090
on the.
So as a girl named beverly and a brother

27
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:44,924
named Mike together,
all these cats make up the loser's club 

28
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,663
and Reggie thinking it's got to be the 
ghost and all these little kids and 

29
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,534
dairy eventually that recognize the 
cloud shacked up in the sewers and 

30
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:02,051
change shape you to some glamour.
Apparently the only way to end that fool

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,840
is my busting a mad lib flow of jokes 
and rentals while buying on edge tongue.

32
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,480
Oh,
it's called the ritual of June and yeah,

33
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,550
man,
it sounds pretty freaking.

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,093
What I like it.
My show loses his daddy's collection of 

35
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:18,594
all those photos.
Now what do you know that clown all up 

36
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,690
in those crusty stills,
man,

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,450
this dude older than,
Oh damn.

38
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,643
I'm trying to bust out the photo and be 
all like break because I'm coming for 

39
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,260
you.
Oh,

40
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:35,150
I don't like this clown man.
Slow the losers.

41
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:35,984
Do the logical thing and get so high and
tripped balls imagining it crash on 

42
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,021
earth.
No,

43
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:45,050
it's a years ago later it gets even 
wider.

44
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:49,250
When he shape shifts into the moon and 
start conversation with Henry bowers,

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,780
he slides a blade and say,
Yo daddy and that girl,

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,730
beverly got to grow so Shank Papa 
bowers.

47
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,564
Get out here.
We get the jump on Bev and while she's 

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,320
struggling to just watch it go down 
without even doing nothing but bev don't

49
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:08,944
play man.
She kicks him right in the nuts and 

50
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,934
bells that go hook up with the losers.
Bill starts getting crunk about how all 

51
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,230
the adults don't give a fuck about 
what's happening to the kids and dairy,

52
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,183
so data side,
they got to be the ones to pull up on 

53
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,454
that beast.

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,490
So they grew up and head down to the 
sewers.

55
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,120
Thing is Harry and his posse creeping up
from behind,

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,163
but it ain't long before it goes cold to
Henry's boys and Henry gets lost for 

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,073
hours.
I have to record it with an inhaler and 

58
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,324
some choice words.
The losers roll up on edge layer and 

59
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,000
bill gets his ass lost in some kind of a
void.

60
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,760
And if you think this Jan was trippy 
before,

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,713
peep this it out.
A giant turtle who created the universe 

62
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,790
say,
Yo,

63
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,420
if you really want to kill it,
you best are laying down that tube.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,950
So bill stopped flowing,
bite down on the monster's tongue and it

65
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,970
scurry away like a little low bitch 
Lillo clown bitch.

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,133
After that,
the losers can't find their way out of 

67
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,550
the tunnels.
But beverly got an idea.

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,910
Hey Boys,
drop your draws and fuck me.

69
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,010
Wait what?
These kids are only 11 stephen man.

70
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,143
So after the assembly line and a freak,
nasty oof the losers find their way out 

71
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:27,364
of the sewers.
They all swear that if the creature 

72
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,094
ain't dead,
they got to come back and put it in the 

73
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,110
ground no matter what.
And as for Henry,

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,060
that full gets tossed in a loony bin and
tastes the fall for all of its murders.

75
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,680
Dan,
27 years later,

76
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:47,140
the children started disappearing and 
dairy again and might get suspicious.

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,020
So he hollered at his old crew and say,
get your ass over here.

78
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:51,854
And bloods and his back.
So all the losers hustled back to dairy 

79
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,490
except stand who get so wigged out,
he slipped his damn risks.

80
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,610
Meanwhile,
Henry get a visit from it who tell them,

81
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:07,900
it's time to bust out of the house to 
get revenge on those losers,

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,033
the cloud being a real dick,
making the losers relive all kinds of 

83
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,230
nasty mess from their childhood.

84
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,140
And if that ain't enough,
babs asshole hobby.

85
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,720
And Bill's wife come to town on the 
bouncy.

86
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,640
Later,
Henry Bowers,

87
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,474
Shane's Mike at the library,
but he's still kicking with a little 

88
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,770
help from it.
Henry,

89
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,580
head over to the hotel,
the ghost,

90
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:30,670
the losers.
But Eddie keeping clutch.

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,290
And Merck's Henry the way most gangsters
do it with a bottle of perrier.

92
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,270
Oh,
classic.

93
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,050
I begin word that might get racked it.
Mind control.

94
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,360
Bev's husband and snatch bills.
Woman.

95
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,870
The losers are all like,
no fucking around man.

96
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,870
Time to end this food.
I have to send more crazy.

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,470
The losers drop in at it's digs,
feel.

98
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,890
Richie and abby started laying down the 
ritual,

99
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,980
a head up into that void and it chops 
addys Damn Arma.

100
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,700
He dead.
What a monster started crawling away.

101
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,240
Been bused.
Everyone zags and bill crushes.

102
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,720
Ed's hard like a jake.
Now that it's finally dead.

103
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,260
They grabbed bill's wife and chunk out 
of the tunnel.

104
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,170
No Gang Bang required this time.
Oh,

105
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:21,980
the losers go their separate ways and 
slowly started the good.

106
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,814
What the hell just happened?
Bill's wife all whacked out in the head 

107
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,080
from all the crazy she saw,
but after bill gives her a ride with his

108
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,680
goofy ass childhood bike.
She snaps right out of it,

109
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,380
but still don't remember what went down.

110
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,603
You might be thinking,
why would a gnarly beast like it set up 

111
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,800
shop in a hub like dairy?
Well,

112
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:49,680
this ain't the innocent small town.
It seemed like,

113
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,460
oh,
that leave it to beaver.

114
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,170
They got a dog side brewing under it.
People who are crooked,

115
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,810
violent,
racist,

116
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,750
and don't give a damn about what's 
happening to these little kids.

117
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,703
See,
it acted like a mirror of the crooked 

118
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,374
ass.
People in dairy just picked this quote 

119
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:10,210
of homies jabbering about the monster.
The one glimpse I called him,

120
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,213
it looked like he had a winchester board
action and it wasn't until later that I 

121
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,414
figured out I must have thought of that 
because that's what I thought he had a 

122
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:24,000
remington because that was what he had 
and when I asked Jimmy about it,

123
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,110
he said that guy was shooting the nose 
spray field just like this.

124
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,770
Funny,
Huh?

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,073
Hey brotha.
Remember the monster packing the same 

126
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,860
piece?
There were packing weapon.

127
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:39,600
That the clown is a reflection of all 
the raw violence inside the heart.

128
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,070
Autumn Hood,
rats.

129
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,113
Matter of fact,
ain't no mistake that it roll around 

130
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,950
decked out.
Lack of clown cars,

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,793
just like a clown.
The people of dairy seemed nice to the 

132
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:53,490
kids on the outside,
but on the inside it's all flows back.

133
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,890
Clown wouldn't even exist if it weren't 
for dairies.

134
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:56,724
Dark deeds.
See it is only able to hit the scene 

135
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,380
when a horrible event go down like child
abuse on murder.

136
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,413
It's like a gnarly cycle where the 
messed up things the dairy folk do 

137
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,813
inspires it to terrorize the people,
which then encourages the people to do 

138
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:17,970
even more wax because this cycle just 
keeps going and going.

139
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,330
It's been chilling in dairy for a long 
ass time.

140
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,403
It's become a part of dairy,
something as much a part of the town is 

141
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,730
the stand pipe or the Canal Abassi Park 
or the library.

142
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,790
Oh,
it's not a matter of our geography.

143
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,180
Somehow it's gotten inside this whole 
cycle.

144
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:40,920
Jam Go even deeper because there'd be 
circular imagery all up in this huge ass

145
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:41,754
book.
The kids struggled back to this hood 

146
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,064
roots when they returned to dairy as 
adults to lay a whip on the monster 

147
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,610
beverly replaced or abusive daddy was an
abusive husband.

148
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,220
The only way they're able to beat it in 
the end,

149
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,113
it's about throwing back to the mental 
of that childhood and flats in their 

150
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,134
imagination.
They even recognize that past events 

151
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,940
happening all over again,
like when big boy band pink,

152
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:07,980
some bz reading the same story she read 
back in the day,

153
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,790
am I supposed to believe that's just 
coincidence because I don't.

154
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,683
There's something really stable in the 
past and present together here or I'm 

155
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:16,674
only imagining it.
The losers always form a circle at 

156
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,370
important points.

157
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,810
Like when they promised a wreck it if he
dad shows his face and Debbie again,

158
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,823
when adults try to remember what went 
down back then and even when everybody 

159
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,990
gathers around a tab,
beverly,

160
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,150
that Ah,
nevermind man,

161
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,460
I can't say that she's the only like 11,
maybe all this cycle job.

162
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,710
Just preaching a greater point about 
evil just like it.

163
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,110
Evil been around since the beginning of 
time,

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,100
but it's only one humans arrived that it
started to take shape.

165
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,220
It says humans keep doing dark deeds 
over and over again at been thriving for

166
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:56,490
centuries.
So maybe that's King's message evil only

167
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,324
because for real,
when humans are allowed to take control 

168
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:03,480
of bus and got all my nasty qualities 
like greed,

169
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
jealousy,
and violence,

170
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,280
it's always been here since the 
beginning of time,

171
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,340
since before there were men anywhere it 
was here.

172
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:14,490
Then sleeping,
maybe waiting for the ice to melt,

173
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
waiting for the people to come out.

174
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,280
Thanks for telling me and my library 
today,

175
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:22,730
