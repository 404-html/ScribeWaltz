1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,040
Well dying,
you know,

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,450
is uncomfortable.
I mean,

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,520
they have particularly these days,
I mean,

4
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:18,110
even physically,
it's not fun people because of the power

5
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:20,060
of medicine,
people are living much longer.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,470
They're living longer and accumulating 
more burden of disease often.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,530
And so they're dying in more pain than,
than people,

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,050
you know,
the early part of the last century.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,470
Um,
dying over prolonged periods of time.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,460
But then there's the inherently human 
emotional pain,

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,340
existential pain of,
of dying,

12
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,460
which is,
you know,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,433
again,
sort of part and parcel of the human 

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,700
condition.
The fact that we are able to contemplate

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,880
our life and the meaning of our life and
to be so articulate within ourselves and

16
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,980
between people in the love that we have 
for one another,

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,220
um,
imposes a downside of,

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
of knowing in such detail the,
the,

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,380
the extent of our losses,
the feeling,

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,910
uh,
emotionally,

21
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,840
the,
um,

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,200
the pain of losing people that we love 
losing people for whom are,

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,333
uh,
are the most important things of our 

24
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,064
life,
uh,

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,020
around whom our life revolves.

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,760
The notion of,
you know,

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,630
where am I going?
What happens after I'm not here?

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,333
There is a great deal of pain in having 
lived and contemplating non life for 

29
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:40,640
many people.
What's interesting is we,

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,020
even those,
uh,

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,873
most pure existentialists who 
contemplate nonexistence and don't 

32
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,520
believe in God or an afterlife,
uh,

33
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,850
feel the pain of nonexistence beyond 
this life.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,960
But if you ask them to contemplate it 
time before they were born,

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,420
it has not nearly the amount of angst,
in other words,

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,383
existence before we were here has,
has none of the emotional charge of 

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,980
existential annihilation beyond this 
life.

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,843
Okay.
