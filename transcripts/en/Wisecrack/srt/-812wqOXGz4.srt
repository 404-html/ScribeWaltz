1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,700
What's it,
the,

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,533
the biggest challenge is that the,
the method that has worked so well for 

3
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:19,250
economics is probably close to its 
limits.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,153
Economics has gotten a tremendous amount
of mileage about by saying what would a 

5
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:29,041
rational self interested person do.
That has been the core and for very many

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,490
things that has been a very productive 
way.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,593
You learn enormous amount and,
and it serves as the basis not just for 

8
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:38,414
abstract theories but for actual 
empirical analysis of behavior and of 

9
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:43,970
policy.
But

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,470
okay,

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,700
in a way we've sort of,

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,620
okay.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,453
Done what you can do with that.
And more and more the key issues in 

14
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,530
economics,
um,

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,843
are involved.
The limits of rationality involve the 

16
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:58,754
places where people don't have the 
ability to assess all of the data they 

17
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:06,080
have where people aren't,
don't make rational choices.

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,230
There is a rapidly growing field of 
behavioral economics,

19
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,064
which is based what that means.
I mean there's no like an hour's 

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,283
behavioral,
but what that means to the economist is 

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,520
that means okay,
we,

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,650
people are apparently not,
you know,

23
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,710
maximizing your utility function,
the way you columnists slight to assume,

24
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:22,544
which is actually a very,
very good way to understand a lot of 

25
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:24,854
human behavior,
but they appear to be doing something 

26
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,520
else.
And so all of those approaches is trying

27
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,020
to understand what people actually do.
That's a,

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,680
that's behavioral and a,
and we're learning a lot.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,020
It's,
it's more of,

30
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,490
it doesn't have a single,
you know,

31
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,380
it doesn't,
can't be summarized in 10 words.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,720
Uh,
which is why it wasn't done first.

33
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,240
But I think we're learning a lot,
but so it's,

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,540
that's a research program.
It's fine.

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,910
Boy influencing policy,
you know,

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,910
that's the labors of sisyphus.
You A,

37
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:51,890
you push it up a little bit,
comes back down.

38
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:55,190
Each generation has to do its bit.
I don't think there's any,

39
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,024
you know,
there will never be a point at which 

40
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,340
good economic analysis is automatically 
incorporated into policy.

41
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:03,800
It takes each generation to try and push
it.

42
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,030
And,
um,

43
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,340
we,
I think we're doing better.

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,470
I think this generation is,
is doing better now than it did 10 years

45
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,960
ago.
We'll see how,

46
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,500
how it,
how it goes in,

47
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,363
but you know,
the next generation will feel the same 

48
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,104
frustration.
