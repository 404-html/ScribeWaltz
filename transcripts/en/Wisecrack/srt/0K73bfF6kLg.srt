00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,593
My name is Graham Hill,
founder of tree hugger and Interactive 

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,550
Planet Green.
From,

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,000
from here we all but now we're in 
Montreal and in the woods.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,503
Uh,
I think it's very much shaped sort of 

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,060
where I,
where I ended up.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,923
So my parents were hippies and really 
the community around there and my 

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,340
parents' friends were largely people 
sort of getting back to the land.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so I lived in a log house and 
learned a lot about sort of conservation

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,253
and nature from my child.
My parents certainly did help it vary a 

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,760
bit.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,400
They're very green in the own way.
My mother is a vegetarian,

12
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:56,060
has been for many,
many years and I certainly remember many

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,320
lessons of conservation from my father 
in a more general sense.

14
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:05,321
My stepfather was very inspirational and
that he just helped me believe in myself

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,030
and just believed that I could do 
whatever I wanted to do and that I was a

16
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:11,864
special person.
And so he was very influential and then 

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,063
some,
certainly some great teachers along the 

18
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,440
way.
My,

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,270
my childhood,
uh,

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,343
later on it was more books,
I guess I used to read fiction back 

21
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,240
then.
So he was sort of different.

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,370
Um,
I don't even know if I can remember.

23
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:28,941
I mean,
I read it,

24
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:32,270
I read,
I certainly was a very much a bookworm.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,490
I loved reading.
Um,

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,030
I don't think they inspired me in the 
same,

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,923
same way.
I mean maybe it's our creativity later 

28
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:45,090
on was more more books like a Gandhi.
I found very inspiring.

29
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:45,924
The,
his is a biography or autobiography and 

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,640
certainly books regarding green 
regarding evolution,

31
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,980
like a beak of the finch by Jonathan 
Wiener,

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,410
natural capitalism,
uh,

33
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,563
by the 11th

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,670
and Paul Hawkin both very inspirational.
Pardon me from my parents,

35
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:12,430
certainly.
So I think I was always somewhat

36
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,450
conscious of it,
conscious of it,

37
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,284
but really it was only a.
So I was vegetarian for quite a long 

38
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,264
time.
I've certainly lived in terms of live 

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,520
with less sometimes due to finances.
I think it really was,

40
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,383
it was,
it was sort of later on though is the 

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,470
sort of mid,
mid twenties to late twenties.

42
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,800
I really started thinking about and 
reading about it and,

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,063
and,
and,

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,970
and getting more concerned about how I 
lived and what

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,760
back I might have with the businesses 
that I might create.

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,260
I always thought I'd be an adventure and
I think that's,

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,900
that's what I became.
And

48
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,743
I,
I still,

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm a creator.
I like to,

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,420
I like to build things and I think that 
that basically is what an adventure is.

51
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,580
I do some products,
I do some media.

52
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,443
Yeah,
you know,

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,330
I could do various things,
but really ultimately I'm an inventor.
