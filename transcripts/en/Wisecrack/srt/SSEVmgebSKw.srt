More on movement at the end of this 
video.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,270
Hey,
wise crack jared here.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,193
Today we're talking about the story of a
guy who takes down the finance industry 

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,940
as he's hawks to imaginary friends.
That's right,

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,013
Mr.
Robot.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
Mr.
Robot follows hoody clad hacker Elliot 

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,943
Alderson as he and his buddies 
instigated a revolution and take down 

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,793
equal a fictional mega corporation.
That's the gold standard of corporate 

10
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,610
malevolence,
a conglomeration of Bank of America,

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,620
Walmart and Enron also Elliot's crazy on
the surface.

12
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:41,940
Mr.
Robot is a show criticizing capitalism.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,600
Tell him about the type of money makes 
you question right and wrong,

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,700
but to really understand Mr.
Robot,

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
we have to dig deeper into an idea that 
is woven into the very fabric of the 

16
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,920
show.
Alienation.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,100
Alienation means to be estranged and 
isolated.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,120
In the parlance of Mr.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,110
Robot disconnected philosophy deals with
different kinds of alienation.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,750
There's alienation from humanity,
from the world,

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,290
and even personal alienation where 
you've become a stranger to yourself.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,030
Mr.
Robot explores them all.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,970
Welcome with his wives cry condition on 
the philosophy of Mr.

24
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,370
Robot.
Oh and spoiler alert.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,773
Mr.
Robot is about lonely people trying to 

26
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:18,354
connect.
Sometimes that means quite literally 

27
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,590
connecting illegally to other people's 
computers.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,753
Agent Dipiro has no life,
no life and struggles to connect with 

29
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,270
both strange men on the internet and her
Amazon Alexa.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,780
Elliot struggles to connect with his 
family,

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
his past,
his friends,

32
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,234
and even reality and the masses 
according to Elliot can only connect to 

33
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,190
each other through facebook,
instagram,

34
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,480
and linkedin.
The show,

35
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,314
even employees visual tricks to 
emphasize the distance between 

36
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,554
characters such as wide angle lenses and
framing characters near the edge of the 

37
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:50,514
screen.
Elliot's and ability to connect is 

38
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,944
caused by more than just his social 
anxiety or that he talks to his dead 

39
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,400
father.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Instead,
Elliot's alienation has everything to do

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,800
with God.
Let me explain.

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,010
Elliot is unable to understand his 
actions,

43
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:05,844
his motives,
or even his relationship to other 

44
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,094
people.
Mr Robot takes charge of Elliot's 

45
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,494
physical body interacting with people on
his behalf all while Elliot is 

46
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,810
completely unaware that anything is 
transpired.

47
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,703
As a result,
Elliot isn't able to understand his 

48
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,010
relationship with his sister,
Darlene,

49
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,870
or anyone else he might've interacted 
with.

50
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:22,704
As Mr.
Robot and while Elliot Psychosis makes 

51
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,520
his alienation from himself and others 
unique,

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,413
the logic that dictates that psychosis 
is nearly universal for German 

53
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,500
philosopher,
Ludvig Feuerbach,

54
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,380
whose name means fire stream.
But I digress.

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,920
God was the primary engine of alienation
during the 19th century.

56
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,083
Humans created the figure of God 
according to the lawyer Bach and 

57
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,250
instilled in with their highest ideals,
justice,

58
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,510
love,
wisdom,

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,720
and so on,
but being a forgetful species,

60
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:52,560
they forgot.

61
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,900
Look at this virtuous God and said,
hey,

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,680
we're so much like this guy.
He made us just like him in this way.

63
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,514
The fact that man made God in man's 
image is inverted to God created man in 

64
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,270
God's image.
As a result,

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,320
Christianity is alienating.
We become estranged from our ideals,

66
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,154
ourselves and each other because we can 
only relate to them through the medium 

67
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,370
of God of figure that we've since lost 
control of,

68
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,100
if this seems strangely familiar,
it should.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,233
Elliot creates the figure of Mr.
Robot forgets he created him and then 

70
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:28,540
goes about letting Mr robot run his life
in good feuerbach,

71
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,370
Ian and fashion.
Elliot says,

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,370
Mr.
Robot has become my God and even creates

73
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,204
Mr robot in his own crazy image.
Mr Robot is even liken to an omniscient 

74
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,960
God always watching Mr.
Robot,

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,090
you have a presence.
Elliot's first response to the problem,

76
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,360
Mr.

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,193
Robot is to get rid of him.
He pumps himself full of adderall and 

78
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,540
starts journaling in the hopes that he 
can kill him off.

79
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,720
This in a way parallels the atheist 
response to God,

80
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,260
but I don't listen to my imaginary 
friend.

81
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:02,320
Why should I listen to yours?
We invented God.

82
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,780
Now we realize it,
so let's dump Joe,

83
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,040
but Elliot's therapist convinces him 
that the answer isn't to dump Mr.

84
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,874
Robot,
it's to accept his delusion as part of 

85
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,910
it.
At this point,

86
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,803
I think we have to accept the fact that 
he is the legitimate and existence and 

87
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,404
your life for 40 bucks.
The biggest problem isn't that we 

88
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,154
invented God.
It's that we inverted our relationship 

89
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:25,990
to God and said,
he created us.

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,913
I'm only supposed to be a prophet.
You're supposed to be my God or voc 

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,370
thinks that God is the ultimate object 
of thinking man,

92
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,790
a creation that speaks to the unlimited 
potential of our reason.

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,893
Similarly,
Mr Robot represents Elliot's highest 

94
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,714
ideals,
creating a better future without Evil 

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,070
Corp.
One of the big issues with alienation is

96
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,770
the loss of responsibility.
You know the old,

97
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,420
I don't hate you,
God does.

98
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,503
It wasn't.
Elliot either suppresses the memory of 

99
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,760
the unpleasant acts.
He has to commit in the name of a better

100
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,280
future like allegedly killing a guy or 
imagines.

101
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,620
Mr.
Robot is responsible in the process.

102
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,780
Elliot isn't able to directly relate to 
the world.

103
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,950
He helps shape or his peers and instead 
has to relate to the medium of Mr.

104
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:09,910
Robot,
right?

105
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,720
It's only when Elliot admits that Mr.
Robot is his own creation.

106
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,780
Betty can finally carve a path out of 
his own alienation.

107
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,420
When we've mixed up the relationship 
between God and the world around us,

108
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,740
the world becomes confusing cause and 
effects seem to invert themselves.

109
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,130
Galilee slips away and we lose touch 
with our fellow man.

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,380
No longer are we the drivers of our 
faith,

111
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,190
but events are laid out by the divine or
your imaginary friend.

112
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,760
We're no longer the judge of our actions
or the actions of others.

113
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,310
God is the rest of the world doesn't see
Mr.

114
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,144
Robot,
but that doesn't stop the show from 

115
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,130
drawing an explicit connection between 
Elliott's delusions and there.

116
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,520
So don't tell me about not being real.
While Mr.

117
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,354
Robot may be Elliot Scott,
the masses have a different God 

118
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,070
consumerism,
which brings us to eight different kinds

119
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,080
of alienation.
Show Creator Sam.

120
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,140
Ismael holds nothing back in paying 
homage to other films,

121
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,974
critical of consumer culture,
aside from the obvious fight club and V 

122
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,560
for vendetta references.
One scene evokes John Carpenter's,

123
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,940
they live of film exploring the truth 
behind modern capitalism and Tyrrell.

124
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,270
Welock is one big O,
two American psycho of film where people

125
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,180
become as disposable as commodity 
sorbet.

126
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,223
Likewise,
one of the central tenants of Mr Robot 

127
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,370
is that consumer culture is a collective
delusion.

128
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,460
One that is strange is us from the world
and each other.

129
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,473
When Mr.
Robot reminds Elliot that nothing is 

130
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,000
real.
He says,

131
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,690
oh whoa.
Builds on fence.

132
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,613
Synthetic emotions in the form of pills,
psychological warfare in the form of 

133
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,323
advertising.

134
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,400
Season one elliot decides to be normal 
by hearting things on instagram,

135
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,950
watching marvel movies and drinking 
starbucks,

136
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,453
drinking starbucks throughout the show.
Material Items and wealth is strange 

137
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,434
people from their true selves.
Whenever Angela Moss has confronted 

138
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,270
about her working for Evil Corp,
for instance,

139
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,000
she defends her character with displays 
of wealth.

140
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,983
When she goes to buy a new pair of shoes
to replace a pair covered in her 

141
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:09,960
coworkers brains,
the salesman confronts her saying,

142
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,360
tell me witness this thing.
You're here to buy new shoes.

143
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,620
I don't know who you think you're 
talking to,

144
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,830
but I'll try the products next.
When again,

145
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:25,050
confronted at a bar by her father's 
friend.

146
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:25,940
She responds

147
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,040
in 2007 and I've got a six figure salary
at the biggest thing on right in history

148
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,180
and I'm just getting started.

149
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,990
If Angeles motive seem unclear to the 
viewer,

150
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,913
they're probably also unclear to her,
and a strange world is a disorienting 

151
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,330
word.
Angela,

152
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,164
who stresses she needs the job.
Evil Corp officer is in the same light 

153
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,630
as the guy who has to euthanize dogs for
a living.

154
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,623
It's just sick that in on me.
I got to pay the bills or the homeless 

155
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:53,914
guy who allows Tarell to beat him 
senseless while wearing sterilized 

156
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,184
surgical gloves in prison.
Leon can only relate to elliot with the 

157
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,720
prisons.
DVD Collection,

158
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,360
namely Seinfeld,
a show about nothing.

159
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,410
The human condition is a straight of 
tragedy because in all of these cases,

160
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,440
mass culture and commodities inhibit our
very being.

161
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,730
Advertising and media encourage us to 
destroy a part of ourselves to fit in.

162
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,060
You destroy parts of ourselves.
Every day.

163
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,130
We Photoshop our wards,
Hawaii annihilation is all we are.

164
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,640
It sells us pre packaged narratives 
about love and life for Elliot.

165
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,700
Only when we destroy the alienating 
forces of consumerism,

166
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,140
can we finally be free?

167
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,410
We will find our true selves again maybe
after wiping away the thick,

168
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,583
grimy film,
a facebook friend requests and vine 

169
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:41,550
stars.

170
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,091
Thus,
Mr.

171
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:44,280
Robot shows a another kind of 
alienation.

172
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,030
Commodity fetishes,
commodity fetishism works a lot like for

173
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,760
your box alienation and it should,
it's greater.

174
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:54,420
Karl Marx appropriated for your box work
for his own ends,

175
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,110
for marks of God mediating human 
relations commodities.

176
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,944
Do we imbue commodities with abstract 
value in such a way that everything 

177
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,990
becomes commodified for Tyrell Welock?
Every interaction is an exchange.

178
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,800
Even going so far is he uses own body in
pursuit of greater wealth.

179
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,170
In the case of the Washington township 
trial,

180
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,004
the people who died as a result of evil 
corpse actions or treated as mere 

181
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,950
commodities,
profits are more important than people's

182
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,784
lives.
It's for the same reason that evil 

183
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,490
corporate executives can so easily 
forgive colby after he testified against

184
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,324
them.
Every action isn't some indicator of 

185
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,650
your character,
but an exchange of goods and services.

186
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,663
In the same vein,
Philip Price Hires Angela despite the 

187
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,814
fact that she blackmailed them,
but what exactly are the stakes of 

188
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,860
alienation in the world of Mr?
Robot.

189
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,770
It's control for both Feuerbach and 
Marx,

190
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,350
the world of the object of collective 
human labor,

191
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,343
the Labor that affirms our species being
or our membership to the human race 

192
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,073
alienation destroys that species being 
because the world that we collectively 

193
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:58,920
build together as now been hijacked by 
someone or something else,

194
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,843
it's no surprise then that every 
character from Angela to elliot to 

195
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:07,380
Tyrrell to price and ministers,
Zhong are vying for control.

196
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,573
You've brought up this issue

197
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,433
before,

198
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,630
this issue of not feeling like you're in
control.

199
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,553
The series even opens with a monologue 
about the people who have the real 

200
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,360
control in society.
Secret board meetings,

201
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:21,150
control who lives and dies over shrimp 
cocktails.

202
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,073
So you were drunk eating shrimp cocktail
and it was raining when you decided my 

203
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,510
mother would die and young people are 
racked with debt,

204
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,463
forcing them into jobs they hate and 
Elliot can't stop the voice in his head 

205
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:35,604
from taking over his life.
Ministers Zhang is obsessed with time 

206
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,354
surrounding himself with clocks,
if only to remind them of the one thing 

207
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:43,790
he can't control.
Nice.

208
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Just put a walking shadow.
No poor player that struts and Brett's,

209
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,000
he's on his stage and Ben is hurting.

210
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,620
You surrounded yourself with the 
constant reminder of mortality.

211
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,580
Led,
seen,

212
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,413
constantly scribbling in his notebook 
about control or fighting for control 

213
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:04,680
with Mr.
Robot,

214
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,490
he attributes Shayla is abused by 
Fernando Vera to the invisible hand,

215
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,220
the economic forces that control her 
life.

216
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,690
There it is again the invisible hand at 
work controlling us even if it pushes us

217
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,330
past our threshold.
In his therapist's office,

218
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,253
he likens the freedom afforded by 
contemporary society to the choice 

219
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,720
between Pepsi and coke.
The real question is,

220
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,643
where's the RC Cola?
Both tyrrell and Elliot blame their 

221
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,600
fathers for their lack of control.
Early on,

222
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,810
Elliot blames his father for giving up 
when Evil Corp poisoned him.

223
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,793
It's about how those bastard slowly 
killed your father and how he wished 

224
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,930
he'd done something about it,
but he didn't because he was his hero.

225
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,030
Just like you're being right now.

226
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,053
Hi,
Raul never wants to become his father 

227
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:48,950
who's inability to speak English was a 
reminder of his helplessness.

228
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,740
Father used to say that to me all the 
time as a child,

229
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,323
what was the only English she knew?
The journals that Elliot frantically 

230
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:01,270
whites about controlling is aptly named 
red wheelbarrow tyrrells own reminder of

231
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,130
his father's impotence.
I'm silly.

232
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:07,570
Po Tyrell also likens murdering.
Sharon knows to absolute power.

233
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,340
He and others are really into playing.
God tend to leave a legacy.

234
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,210
The standard of which was set by God.
Elliot at times is unsure if he's Mr.

235
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,780
Robot Scott or Mr.
Robot is his God.

236
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,913
In the end,
Mr robot shows that nobody is really in 

237
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:25,764
control in an alienated world.
The people at the top have become 

238
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:31,830
victims of their own machinations.
While they may try to create an illusion

239
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,664
of control with armies of lawyers,
convoluted conspiracies and bunker data 

240
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,280
centers,
they all experienced the same alienating

241
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,114
forces as the rest of society,
whether it be in the form of God or 

242
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,890
commodity fetishism.
Conclusion.

243
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,143
Mr.
Robot is not only a show about lonely 

244
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,394
people trying to connect,
it's about the engines that drive that 

245
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:53,550
loneliness,
whether it's God or imaginary friends or

246
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:56,790
the things we own.
That engine distorts our perceptions and

247
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,624
turns a reality on its head.
We can never really be sure what's 

248
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,620
reality or delusion and Mr.

249
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,860
Robot and that's sort of the in an 
alienated world.

250
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,590
Can we be sure that any kind of reality 
exists?

251
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,633
Thanks for watching guys.
But whether you're in reality or 

252
