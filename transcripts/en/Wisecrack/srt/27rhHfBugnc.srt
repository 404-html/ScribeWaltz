1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,110
Yes,

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,843
track jared here today were dawning our 
trench coats as we talk about what went 

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:14,900
wrong with the final installment of the 
rather tragic Matrix trilogy,

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,800
the Matrix revolutions.
We could talk about the flat characters,

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,770
unclear motivations and structural 
cluster,

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,820
but perhaps the most important thing to 
address is the fact that,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,833
well,
the movie just doesn't make much sense 

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,080
or to put it more generously.
It has some colossal narrative gaps.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,033
We basically can't make sense of the 
plot without some pretty massive 

10
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,604
interpretive leads.
Here are our top three burning 

11
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:40,910
questions.
One,

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,540
how the hell does neil have powers 
outside the matrix to?

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,220
Does Neil make his own choices or is he 
just a pawn of larger forces?

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,460
And three,
is neil supposed to be Jesus again,

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,473
and how does this religious imagery fit 
into the story given how much thought 

16
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,300
went into these films?
It can't be that the witch house,

17
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:00,680
he's just dropped the narrative.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,690
Ballz oily,
right?

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,090
So if the answer is don't lie in the 
narrative,

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,390
perhaps they lie in the philosophies 
that inspired the film's,

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,360
woken with his wife's cry condition on 
the Matrix revolutions,

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,690
what went wrong,
and of course spoilers ahead in case you

23
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,670
don't read.
Watch the trilogy every few weeks.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,720
Here's a recap in the matrix.
Neo wakes up from a simulated reality to

25
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,554
discover machines control the world,
and he is the one prophesized to save 

26
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,324
humans from their metal photos,
digital ass kicking in suits in 

27
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,104
reloaded.
These dreams are dashed when we 

28
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:32,264
discovered that neos not special,
the prophecy was part of the machine 

29
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,304
scheme.
All the log and the film ends with him 

30
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,090
gaining insane powers,
but also in a coma.

31
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,583
In revolutions,
neo awakes from his coma and cooperates 

32
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,854
with the machines to beat agent Smith 
and a fight to the death saving humans 

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,800
and maybe machines from lives of 
servitude.

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,920
So how does neo have power in the real 
world?

35
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,470
The only explanation in the film were 
given is this.

36
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,570
Tell me how I separated my mind from my 
body without checking it.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,780
Tell me how I stopped for sentinels.
My thinking.

38
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,690
Tell me just what the hell is happening 
to me?

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,890
The power extends beyond this world all 
the way back to where it came from,

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,360
where the source,
and that's great you felt when you touch

41
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,380
those sentence

42
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,420
and then in the end of the Matrix video 
game,

43
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,283
we get

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,980
touched.
The source separated.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,333
It's mine.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,740
These are basically non explanations 
since they don't,

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,870
you know,
actually explain anything.

48
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,883
There are also fan theories.
Maybe there's a matrix within a matrix 

49
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,260
or maybe Neil's wirelessly connected to 
the source.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,193
Dial up is very nineties,
but none of these are really textually 

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,770
supported.
Instead we think these mysterious powers

52
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,970
have something to do with French 
philosophers.

53
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,850
John Beaudry,
art in the Matrix,

54
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:53,310
the witch house keys referenced 
boatyards several times.

55
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,220
Welcome to the desert,
the real,

56
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,203
the desert of the characterizes beaudry 
arts critique of the postmodern era 

57
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,650
where meaning and reality are replaced 
by ear representations for Baudrillard.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,913
The term similar locker described signs 
that have no relation to the real but 

59
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,234
pretend to like a painting that looks 
like a polaroid photo of a Unicorn on 

60
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:21,040
instagram.
When these fake copies without originals

61
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,410
get together,
they form simulations,

62
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,470
and when simulations hookup,
they replace reality.

63
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,423
With the virtual,
the web of media we're plugged into all 

64
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,930
day.
What's worse?

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,190
There's no easy exit from the virtual.
You can't tell it isn't real,

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,143
because who even remembers what reality 
is when the virtual becomes more real 

67
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:45,190
than reality itself.
We enter hyperreality where technologies

68
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:50,020
and simulations control meaning not 
humans like a desert wasteland.

69
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,720
Reality is emptied of meaning for 
humans.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,180
The problem is the witch house keys took
this a bit,

71
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,014
but literally they show technology that 
controls meaning by literally enslaving 

72
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,430
humans.

73
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,263
Meanwhile,
the real is a literal desert or more 

74
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,714
like more door meets Manhattan,
and the Matrix is not just simulated 

75
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,350
ideas and technologies,
but a physical network into which humans

76
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,280
are literally plugged.
Even bogart himself criticized the witch

77
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:16,114
house skis saying they took the 
hypothesis of the virtual for an 

78
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:22,660
irrefutable fact and transformed it into
a visible phantasm,

79
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,823
but it is precisely that we can no 
longer employ categories of the real in 

80
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:29,980
order to discuss the characteristics of 
the virtual.

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,020
That's French for they've done for 
Baudrillard.

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,180
There are no red pills and blue pills or
external reference points from which you

83
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,030
can distinguish the real from the fake 
if you could.

84
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,390
One could easily choose the real as neo 
and others do,

85
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,960
so laying one final bit of smack 
boatyard insisted.

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,033
What would be interesting is to show 
what happens when these two worlds 

87
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,550
collide.

88
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,610
It seems the which house keys not only 
took boatyards words to heart,

89
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,120
they plotted a pretty wild course 
correction in the sequels.

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,960
They attempt to merge the real and the 
virtual by giving neo powers.

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,853
In the quote real world,
we start the trilogy thinking of Neo as 

92
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:09,130
real and the matrix and its programs as 
fake,

93
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,970
but as the matrix revolution seems to 
imply were wrong.

94
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,320
Neo doesn't just plug into the virtual,
he can't unplug from it.

95
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,363
The virtual is inside of him.
When he kills the sentinels or 

96
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,174
experiences the train station in a coma,
we see a more complex idea of the 

97
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,080
virtual that is not the opposite of the 
real,

98
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,943
but a layer of the real or interwoven 
and confused with it that neocon tap 

99
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,134
into.
This may also explain how Smith entered 

100
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,300
the real world.
When Smith clones himself onto Bain,

101
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,450
the real becomes virtual,
the virtual becomes real,

102
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,750
and the distinction between mind and 
body collapses.

103
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,763
This idea of the real world as virtual 
can also explain why neo can see the 

104
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:55,330
world as energy pulses as if it's a 
virtual.

105
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,380
Here,
the witch house keys borrow from the old

106
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:02,090
archetype of the blind seer.
Someone who through seeing less actually

107
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,620
understands more odin even plucked out 
his own eye to gain knowledge,

108
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,350
although it's probably not what boatyard
had in mind.

109
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,303
Neil's blindness helps him literally see
a fundamental truth about the 

110
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,650
relationship between the real and the 
virtual,

111
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,560
namely that they aren't as separate as 
he thought.

112
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,723
Finally,
Baudrillard helps explain what's 

113
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,404
happening in that train station.
The weird limbo space between the real 

114
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,693
and the virtual.
Here neo discovers programs who want to 

115
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,843
escape the so called real world where 
they're forced to carry out their 

116
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:35,930
programming and attempt to hide in the 
matrix from the perspective of humans,

117
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:39,980
the Matrix as a deceptive false space 
that steals their agency,

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,993
but for the programs,
the matrix is a liberatory space where 

119
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,240
they can be their true selves.
If you're a digital entity,

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,030
maybe the virtual world is the real 
world.

121
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,043
This is perhaps why at the very end,
the Oracle is ambiguous in her plea to 

122
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,570
the architect.

123
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,940
What about the others?
What others come on and say,

124
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm fiercely.
They will be freed.

125
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,180
Is she referring to the humans or 
machines?

126
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,133
Could be both,
but for the machines getting out might 

127
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,270
mean getting in and for the humans,
vice versa.

128
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,600
This brings us to the conflict between 
choice and determinism,

129
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,360
which if you remember from our matrix 
reloaded video,

130
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,860
they never shut up about

131
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,580
causality.
Action,

132
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,300
reaction,
cause and effect.

133
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,900
Everything begins with choice.
No wrong.

134
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,420
Inevitable is literally the last word 
neo ever speak.

135
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,693
That's right,

136
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,090
right after he says,

137
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,070
yeah,

138
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,903
wait,
choose what to keep fighting something 

139
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:47,750
else.
Be Clear,

140
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,584
man,
and whatever choice he refers to isn't 

141
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,523
even up to neo or AC,
just the product of larger fates and 

142
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,334
factors.
How does this fit in with the oracles 

143
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,633
apparent omniscience?
Is it some mutation in his programming 

144
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:03,320
or purpose that drives agent Smith to 
start a clone war?

145
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,213
Is it chance or does he reveal that 
programs have the capacity for choice 

146
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,174
and free will?
Let's see if we can use some philosophy 

147
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:10,964
of free will,
determinism and fatalism to make sense 

148
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:13,964
of this show.
Most of us experience ourselves as 

149
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,934
making choices.
We write geeky videos on Friday nights 

150
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,234
because like neo week shoes to and not 
because we don't have friends for 

151
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,124
aristotle.
This is because humans are rational 

152
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:27,734
animals.
Our reason helps us to make choices and 

153
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:34,931
differentiates us from other animals and
technology to call something a choice.

154
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,923
One must be able to act otherwise and 
not be driven by mere instinct or 

155
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,950
programming,
and most of us probably agree with David

156
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,783
Hume,
that the ability to act or not act 

157
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,950
according to our own desires and reason 
is the basis of human freedom.

158
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,053
Neo morpheus and the rest of the gang 
certainly agree and they're cheesed off 

159
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:53,924
because humans are being treated well 
like machines with their minds and 

160
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:01,050
bodies totally controlled while plugged 
into the matrix.

161
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,050
They don't seem to have the capacity to 
act otherwise,

162
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,620
and of course the arc of the whole 
series bends toward gaining freedom,

163
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,753
but of course it's not that simple.
Neo and friends don't realize that 

164
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,690
freedom of choice is actually part of 
the matrix itself.

165
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,230
In perhaps the most cryptic conversation
in cinema history,

166
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,153
the architect reveals earlier versions 
of the Matrix didn't work because even 

167
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,700
though the world was perfect for humans,
they were being forced

168
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,920
choice.
Choice,

169
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,893
but choice is so essential.
Humans value to it even over perfect 

170
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,360
happiness.

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Do you know that the first matrix was 
designed to be a perfect human,

172
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,073
the world or suffered every.
Everyone would be happy and it was a 

173
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,450
disaster.
No one would accept the program.

174
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:52,340
Entire crops were lost.

175
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,630
The current matrix only works because it
accounts for the human need to choose.

176
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,390
I'll be at a paradoxical choice to give 
up their freedom.

177
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,273
As I was saying,
she stumbled upon a solution whereby 

178
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,434
nearly 99 percent of all tests subjects 
accepted the program as long as they 

179
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:05,974
were given a choice,
even if they were only aware of the 

180
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,370
choice at an unconscious level.

181
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,070
Hey,
wait,

182
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,903
doesn't this look similar to boatyards 
claim that we prefer and willingly give 

183
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,360
up control of meaning to the virtual?
Yes,

184
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,203
it does.
Gerrit.

185
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,163
Anyway,
this produces anomalies in the heart of 

186
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,490
the system.
Neo and his five predecessors.

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,533
Human choice means there are some 
aspects of the architect's plan that 

188
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,760
can't be predicted.
Enter Neil,

189
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,360
who chooses to save trinity instead of 
reloading the Matrix,

190
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,850
freewill one,
determinism zero,

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,320
but does neo really make a choice?
There are several reasons to wonder.

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,273
First it looks like neo chooses to give.
The architects play a big middle finger 

193
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:46,820
and runoff the safe trinity,
but for Aristotle and Aquinas,

194
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,130
the passions like love,
anger,

195
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,023
jealousy,
or the Kryptonite of choice and free 

196
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,890
will.
They're no more than animal impulses.

197
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,700
The architect also isn't buying it.
Maybe it's because he doesn't understand

198
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,340
choice.

199
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,370
You and I may not be able to see beyond 
our own choices,

200
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,980
but that man can't see past any choice

201
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,930
or it's because he thinks neos returned 
to trinity is just the result of another

202
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,730
causal law.
Love

203
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,723
already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal the 

204
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:20,070
onset of an emotion signed specifically 
to overwhelm logic and reason

205
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,150
or as a wise crack favorite puts it what
people call love.

206
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,850
It's just a chemical reaction to compels
animals to breed.

207
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,930
It's possible that neos just responding 
to basic evolutionary programming,

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,840
what the architect refers to as a 
chemical reaction.

209
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,320
Colonel Sanders incarnate believed that 
everything is mechanistic.

210
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,303
The matrix fellow programs and even 
humans don't have choice but operate 

211
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:41,444
unphysical,
logical and mathematical laws of 

212
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:44,534
causation.
This version of determinism dates back 

213
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,264
to ancient philosophers like Democritus,
loose ipis and others you might confuse 

214
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:54,400
for diseases who began noting the 
physical was not random,

215
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,780
but governed by strict causal laws.
Determinist buzz kills that.

216
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:03,280
They are always claimed the appearance 
of choice is just part of the system.

217
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,323
Once the architect notices the human 
need to at least feel like they're 

218
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,580
making choices,
even though they'd be plugged in like so

219
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,170
many light brights,
no matter what,

220
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,350
he just adds choice to his determinist 
calculations.

221
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,333
Then the whole function of the one is to
control the narrative of choice and 

222
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,310
resistance in a way that suits the 
machines.

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,940
They're stuck in a cycle.
Every time you think you're escaping the

224
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:26,110
system.
Nope.

225
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,270
Xy on rises.
The one appears.

226
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,940
He meets the architect.
The one chooses most.

227
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,774
Everyone dies.
The Matrix reloads xy on the one weird 

228
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,400
conversation,
choice death,

229
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,030
reload,
rinse and repeat until neo,

230
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,420
but even if we buy,
but it's love with a capital l,

231
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,313
not just chemicals that made him exit 
door number two or do whatever he's 

232
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:52,720
referring to here.
There are still reasons to be suspicious

233
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:53,554
that it was ancient human choice for 
medieval theologian and 40 year old 

234
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,140
Virgin Thomas Aquinas choices.
Not Enough.

235
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,213
It's our freewill that makes us 
sensitive to which goals are best or 

236
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:08,230
most moral and allows us to be held 
responsible for our choices is neos will

237
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:08,830
free.

238
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,590
Well,
one very powerful old lady and something

239
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,424
called fatalism makes that unlikely and 
don't worry about fatalism is like 

240
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:26,290
determinism with a heaping spoonful of 
the supernatural.

241
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,303
Let's focused on physical laws,
fatalist claim events are destined to 

242
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,620
occur because the gods,
the fate,

243
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,360
or even our own character and 
compulsion's directly caused them to and

244
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,270
if by gods they mean a bearded math 
program,

245
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,630
a cookie baking profit and a self 
replicating Lord l Ron,

246
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,840
then we're inclined to agree over the 
course of the films,

247
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:51,430
the Oracle's been very busy.
She's the one behind the prophecy and if

248
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:55,840
we're to believe the prophecy is just a 
mechanization to met out the anomaly and

249
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,674
guide him to the source,
then that would mean she's tricking neo 

250
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:03,070
and his pals into almost every one of 
their decisions.

251
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,150
Even when she pretends it's his choice 
through a fatalist lens.

252
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:07,984
It almost seems like she and the 
architect are pulling all the strings 

253
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,793
and the whole series is just a game of 
chess between the two of them made a 

254
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,960
very dangerous game.
Then again,

255
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,794
the witch house keys leave us wondering,
does the Oracle really make her own 

256
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,094
choices or is she just a product of fate
and determinism to by aristotle and 

257
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,780
Aquinas is definitions.
It seems she does make choices.

258
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,703
I made a choice and that choice,
she makes the choice to save Sati and 

259
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:39,610
let agent Smith turned her into a clown,
but she also says she made these choices

260
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:44,611
to fulfill her purpose.
What's your purpose to balance?

261
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,750
She also says they had to happen to 
happen.

262
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,460
I'm sure it couldn't be here like you 
remember

263
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,860
me,
but it wasn't meant to be

264
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,823
so maybe she isn't making choices,
so if neo isn't making his own choices 

265
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:01,260
and the oracle might not be either than 
is anyone.

266
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,550
This movie is freaking impossible.
Maybe agent Smith,

267
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,384
as his name suggests,
is the only real being with agency in 

268
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,310
the film.
When he's killed by neo,

269
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,190
he refuses to return to the source to be
destroyed.

270
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,150
I knew the route,

271
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,470
so I understood what I was supposed.

272
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,870
It's a choice similar to the one neo 
makes,

273
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,890
right?
No,

274
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,903
by his own account.
Smith as a diehard fatalist and he 

275
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:29,540
doesn't see this as a matter of will,
but part of a grander plan.

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,630
We're not here because we're here 
because we're not free.

277
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,920
There's no skipping,
no denying purpose,

278
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,750
because as we both know without purpose,
we would not exist

279
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,250
and he's pretty sure his purpose is 
still to kill neo.

280
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,590
Ultimately.
Agent Smith believes freedom.

281
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,483
Truth,
peace and love are just illusions and 

282
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:55,830
fantasies as meaningless as the matrix 
itself.

283
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,070
There's a freedom or peace but love 
illusions.

284
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:03,440
Mr Anderson,
vagaries of perception,

285
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,450
temporary constructs of a feeble human 
intellect,

286
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,284
trying just Berkeley to justify an 
existence that is without meaning or 

287
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:15,220
purpose in all of them as artificial as 
the matrix.

288
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,910
Really programming and fate are real and
because they're not programmed,

289
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,893
human lives are empty,
but just when determinism and fate 

290
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,460
appear to have kicked us out of choice,
we're reminded that will for freedom.

291
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:32,600
Peace and love means something for both 
humans and programs.

292
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,573
I love my doctor very much.
I just have never program speak of see 

293
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,090
human emotion now,
etc.

294
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,240
But methods is the connection.
The word implies

295
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,163
love.
It is not just an illusion or some 

296
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:49,694
chemical Bs.
It's a powerful and meaningful 

297
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,544
connection and so his freedom or the 
freedom to do otherwise sati doesn't 

298
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:57,590
have a purpose.

299
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,440
I find it to be the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen,

300
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,320
like where we are from.
that is not enough.

301
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,980
Every program that is created must have 
a purpose.

302
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,960
If it does not,
it is deleted,

303
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,130
but her life is still worth living and 
she should be free to live it.

304
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,610
Neo realizes that just as humans can 
exercise their freewill,

305
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,563
some programs can't either.
Maybe This is what makes neo realize 

306
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,390
that it isn't just humanity that needs 
saving from this war.

307
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,110
If we really want to talk about choice,
there must be choice for everyone.

308
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,690
Then again,
before we can put our neck braces away,

309
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,524
we're in for more whiplash because it's 
the oracle who sent sati and her family 

310
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:37,640
here at this exact time for this 
revelation about freedom,

311
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,640
what choice to help you to guy neil

312
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,730
high and it makes it again seem like 
she's controlling everything.

313
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,150
After all thIs and all the films chit 
chat about choice.

314
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,190
It's not that neo or anyone else for 
that matter actually makes one.

315
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,950
If nobody is making choices,
that is neil,

316
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,620
even the real protagonist.
Is it the oracle?

317
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,700
Are we even supposed to care as if there
aren't enough unexplained plot points?

318
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,060
Revolutions ends with some confusing 
religious imagery.

319
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,320
What exactly is this glowing jacked in 
jesus supposed to show us?

320
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,410
Maybe we can explain this in terms of 
choice versus fate,

321
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,423
but also faith from the beginning.
Neo is a quasi religious figure who 

322
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:21,120
helps save humans from their ignorance 
and enslavement in the matrix.

323
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,073
He's basically straight out of the 
gnostic gospels which talk about a 

324
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:28,050
savior who is the ultimate guide to the 
nature of reality.

325
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,153
This group of religious,
mostly christian heretics in the early 

326
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,550
ce claimed that humans perceive the 
material world in darkness,

327
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:39,990
sleep night and blindness and must be 
saved through waking knowledge,

328
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,070
light,
etc.

329
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,293
Sound familiar?
Neil basically spends half the trilogy 

330
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,070
just waking up.
When neo sacrIfices himself,

331
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:51,120
he enables true knowledge of reality and
peace between machines and humans,

332
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,060
but it's not determinism that gets him 
this far.

333
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,103
It's faith.
He has faith in his purpose and in the 

334
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:01,320
possibility of peace even when he 
doesn't have a clue what he's doing,

335
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,420
but beyond that,
I don't know

336
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,543
even the faith of the other characters 
play a big role in turning the tide of 

337
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:13,474
the war.

338
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,090
So

339
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,950
while we can't explain how neo raises 
the dead or how the blind can see,

340
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,110
that kind of seems like part of the 
point.

341
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,580
Maybe the religious imagery is the last 
word on the whole determinism business.

342
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,630
Some things exist beyond reason.
Clarity or calculations,

343
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,830
maybe part of what makes us human is 
this capacity for faith in peace,

344
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,620
in goodness,
and something beyond ourselves.

345
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,633
So far,
we've tried to fill some plot holes by 

346
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,640
exploring the witch house keys,
philosophy,

347
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,474
faves,
but perhaps the answer to our question 

348
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:50,190
has been lying in a small detail all 
along.

349
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,203
The oracles earrings.
Maybe many of the inexplicably 

350
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:54,384
happenings in revolutions are there to 
prove some sort of uni and yankee point 

351
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,420
that it's not about winning,
but balance.

352
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,463
the philosophy of yin and yang found in 
taoism and confucianism is present in 

353
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:06,480
the films,
not only in jewelry,

354
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,110
but in themes like balance cycles and 
dichotomies.

355
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,393
According to chinese philosopher joe,
he yin represents a dark condensing 

356
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:18,660
force and is associated with metal fire 
and the material world.

357
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,170
Yang is associated with light expanding 
forces,

358
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,280
water,
earth,

359
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,203
ci or energy forces in life flows.
Notice that in revolutions the real 

360
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:28,764
world is full of machines and bodies and
is literally dark and on fire while the 

361
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:37,260
virtual world is of the mind or things 
are light and well not on fire,

362
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,130
but getting yang are not dichotomies.
they stand for opposite,

363
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,570
but connected forces like a light and 
dark side of the same hill.

364
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,583
So why do asian smith,
neo both have unexplained powers and 

365
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:52,540
obsess over each other because they are 
yin and yang,

366
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,270
light and dark sides of the same 
anomaly.

367
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,840
what is he?
He's.

368
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,083
You could be so good.
The equation trying to balance itself 

369
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,060
out

370
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,210
instead of confusing the real and the 
virtual allah baudrillard,

371
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,133
yin and yang,
help explain how the real and the 

372
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:11,234
virtual are two sides of the same coin 
and both are important for achieving 

373
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:19,070
peace between machines and humans.
Was neo making his own choices or was he

374
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:19,904
determined by larger fates like the 
architect and the oracle who are also a 

375
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:25,250
bit uni and yaggie we'll never really 
know,

376
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,550
but in revolutions,
choice and fate are a bit yin and yang.

377
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,610
Equally important aspects of the human 
experience.

378
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,563
Is the matrix really a religious 
allegory bringing credence to the 

379
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:35,834
prophecy or did the oracle make the 
whole thing up to win a game of wits 

380
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:40,550
against the architect?
Again,

381
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,490
we'll never know,
but maybe that's deliberate.

382
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,503
Both faith and faith are important 
aspects of making meaning for programs 

383
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:50,840
and humans,
and maybe we're being too meta here,

384
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,763
but it seems revolutions even combines 
eastern and western philosophy as two 

385
00:21:55,341 --> 00:21:57,770
important parts of the philosophical 
story.

386
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,380
So to summarIze what went wrong?
Well,

387
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:01,214
we've spent over 20 minutes 
philosophizing about these films and 

388
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:06,410
still have no idea what exactly 
happened,

389
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,670
but maybe that's the point.
The film seems committed to being beyond

390
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:15,140
sense.
If they told us everything or flawlessly

391
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:18,440
implemented each philosophy,
wouldn't they just undermine their whole

392
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:22,760
point at some things are beyond 
reasoning calculation and that's okay.

393
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,620
Or maybe we're giving the which house 
keys.

394
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:26,120
Too much credit.
Either way,

395
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,103
despite their flaws,
we won't be unplugging from these 

396
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:30,260
stories time soon.

397
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,810
Thanks for watching.
WIse crack.

398
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,860
We love making videos for y'all and it's
your support that keeps us going.

399
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,920
So another way to support us is by 
becoming a patron patrons.

400
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:45,450
Get immediate access to exclusive patron
only releases including special podcast.

401
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,373
Our new video on the movie it and a 
sneak peek of our upcoming wisecrack 

402
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,730
addition on the philosophy of mr.
Robot,

403
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,073
and another new thing we're trying out 
is a podcast format called wisecrack 

404
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,433
addition extra.
You guys are always asking us about 

405
00:22:57,181 --> 00:23:00,240
behind the scenes stuff like what is the
research process look like?

406
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:03,450
What is the writing process look like?
What does it take to make these videos?

407
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,373
Well,
now I'm holding our long conversations 

408
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:07,620
with the writers,
researchers,

409
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,770
and directors of these videos to help 
you give you guys extra content.

410
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,930
If you want to think more about these 
properties.

411
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,390
So if you guys are matrix philosophy 
freaks,

412
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,750
I just recorded an exclusive interview 
with the writer and researcher.

413
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,613
This video you're watching right now,
you'll get access to the podcast and 

414
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:23,244
everything else on our patrion page.
Plus we're working on more exclusives 

415
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,843
each month.
Once we reach our big milestone will be 

416
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,930
able to branch out even further.
Look,

417
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:34,140
there are tons of movies and tv shows 
out there that we'd love to cover,

418
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,123
but the reality of running a youtube 
channel is that you have to focus on 

419
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,050
stuff that's super popular in order to 
keep the lights on.

420
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,973
So by helping us reach our nexT 
milestone will be able to make deeper 

421
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:45,650
track videos on topics.
You guys request the time,

422
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,700
stuff like whiplash,
dr twin peaks fargo and tons more,

423
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,623
and as a patriot,
you'll get exclusive access to these 

424
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,413
videos months before anyone else.
So click here or use the link in the 

425
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,850
description to visit our patrion page 
and become a patron.
