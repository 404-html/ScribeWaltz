1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,390
A good example of collaboration is to 
look at the international space station.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,253
The International Space Station is 
arguably one of the most complex 

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:07,674
complicated structures ever built.
It's bigger than a football field if it 

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:13,140
was on the earth and we'll weigh about a
million pounds a.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,290
It is an amazing orbiting research 
facility and it was built in space by 15

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,244
nations.
Some of these nations were not always 

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:22,884
the best of friends.
In some cases they were on opposite 

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,074
sides of the Cold War and opposite 
opposite sides of the space race and 

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,040
what enabled this to happen in space.
What enabled this construction project,

10
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,064
what enabled enabled this amazing 
accomplishment of humanity was the 

11
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:42,690
willingness to set aside our differences
and work together towards a common goal.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,943
And what we did is we found something 
that we agreed on in this particular 

13
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,970
case,
space exploration,

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,253
and we decided to work through that and 
what developed is personal 

15
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,610
relationships.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,443
People got to know each other.
They got to see that their hopes and 

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,190
dreams and their motivation for being in
the space program and being in the space

18
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,024
business were the same.
And through those personal 

19
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:09,660
relationships,
trust developed and through that trust,

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,913
that trust that was built through those 
personal relationships enabled the 

21
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,500
program to weather the storms,
the weather,

22
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,334
the,
the eventual bumps in the road and the 

23
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:21,720
crises that occurred.
And I think that is a,

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,270
that is a really good lesson that we can
apply.

25
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:27,450
We can take the lesson that built the 
international space station and bring it

26
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,284
down to earth.
We could put it in the context of a 

27
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,894
rapidly developing hyper interconnected 
global society and realize that we can 

28
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,094
do amazing things here on earth by 
applying that same level of 

29
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,750
collaboration.
I think the secret sauce,

30
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,600
if you will,
was to seek the low hanging fruit,

31
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,434
seek those things that we do agree on,
and use that to build relationships and 

32
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,694
to build the platform through which we 
can then start to address the things 

33
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,300
that we don't agree on.
