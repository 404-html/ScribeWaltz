1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,950
I think it's indivisible,
surely die,

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,190
then you've got it,
or you have.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,920
And every diminution of freedom of 
speech diminishes everyone and,

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,823
uh,
lessens the currency of freedom of 

5
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:23,720
speech.
But I,

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,030
I feel nothing better.
Nice when it's done lightly.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,940
It has to be a controversial statement,
has to be earned.

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,310
It can't just be tossed off.
You have to be able to,

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,440
you know,
back it up.

10
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,980
And so I would,
I would,

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,190
I would urge,
you know,

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,150
civilized standards of moderation on 
both sides.

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,223
It has to be understood that freedom of 
speech isn't justice at a decadent 

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,523
frippery that we,
that we gather around us like all our 

15
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,444
other comforts and privileges.
Democracy can't work without freedom of 

16
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:06,544
speech.
It's an absolute cornerstone of 

17
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:09,454
democracy.
So we have to be very responsible about 

18
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:16,030
this freedom,
but there's no giving it up.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,250
Well,
modifying it.

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,290
Eaton,
I would say it's a,

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,350
it's an offshoot of what solidified on 
the political correctness.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,720
And,
um,

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,710
I'm a fan of political correctness.
No one ever says I will.

24
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,290
I'm very politically politically 
correct,

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,160
but in fact it's good that we are,
uh,

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,920
not,
not the outer fringe pc,

27
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,440
that and raising the standards about 
what can be said and,

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,383
uh,
an exclusion was things you could have 

29
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:51,064
said and got away with it a 10 or 20 
years ago and now seems discordant and 

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,630
you know,
who wants to go back to being opposed to

31
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:06,430
gay marriage.
I mean,

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,073
the ease with which that became the 
orthodoxy was I thought tremendously 

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,930
encouraging.
Um,

34
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,350
and the idea that Donald Trump has cost 
off the shackles and we go back to being

35
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,170
brutes again,
um,

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,100
is a,
is a terrible prospects pc.

37
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:32,101
His has been an agent for certain sort 
of evolutionary acceleration,

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,120
uh,
in,

39
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,900
towards progressive ideas.
And I can't.

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,110
I think that's been very good.
I mean,

41
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:48,610
when I look back at my very early 
fiction of 40 odd years ago,

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,183
I'm,
I'm shocked and made uneasy by some of 

43
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,760
the liberties I took that I have set and
he wouldn't take no.

44
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,400
Um,
it,

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,470
it doesn't interfere with the freedom of
writers,

46
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,603
political correctness.
It gives you challenges every now and 

47
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,650
then you'd have to sort of work grounded
a bit,

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,530
but I never resent that.
And I think it's,

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,393
it's,
um,

50
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,530
self improvement on a general scale that
we've all responded to.
