00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
This video is brought to you by audible.
Hey,

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,200
was helen here?
So jared is on vacation,

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,760
which gives me the chance to tell you 
all about the philosophy of a show about

4
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,490
philosophy.
This could get meta.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,913
The good place is a fascinating piece of
television because while it includes 

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,960
philosophy lessons as a major plot 
point,

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,200
it also incorporates its own ideas on 
human nature,

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,123
fate and ethics for a show us sensibly 
about teaching people to be good in the 

9
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,354
afterlife.
The good place asks a more profound 

10
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,054
question,
can those lessons actually make us 

11
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,040
better people and if they can,
does that matter?

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,143
Welcome to today's much requested 
episode on the philosophy of the good 

13
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,220
place.
Spoilers ahead.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,413
Okay,
so a recap for any uninitiated into the 

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,504
world of the good place.
The premise of the first season is that 

16
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:57,570
coworker betraying senior scamming 
tequila slugging human garbage.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Eleanor Shell Strop dies and 
accidentally ends up in the good place.

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,970
There's been a big mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here,

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,480
which is basically heaven,
except without all the religion he stuff

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,660
which we're laying makes it way,
way more elitist.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,703
Only the very best to get into the good 
place based on an intense point system 

22
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:17,604
to determine exactly how good you are.
You need me to lie to old people and 

23
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,650
scare them into buying fake allergy 
medicine.

24
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,484
I get it,
man.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,413
Which one's my desk?
Even though eleanor probably doesn't 

26
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,140
belong in any religions,
good place.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,120
The point system gets absurd.

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,263
Every single thing you did had an effect
that rippled out over time and 

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
ultimately created some amount of good 
or bad.

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,890
She's joined in her paradise 
neighborhood by to honey,

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,630
a beautiful,
wealthy philanthropist.

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,583
John,
you a Buddhist monk and her supposedly 

33
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:50,410
soulmate Cheaty,
a philosophy professor specializing in,

34
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,720
you guessed it,
ethics also.

35
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,290
There's a lot of frozen yogurt.
What is it with you and frozen yogurt?

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,910
Have you not heard of ice?

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,243
Oh sure.
That I've come to really like frozen 

38
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,374
yogurt.
There's something so human about taking 

39
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:07,080
something great and ruining it a little 
so you can have more of it.

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,073
Oh,
those are good place is supposed to be 

41
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:09,934
heaven for eleanor.
Being surrounded by people who are 

42
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:17,230
better than her is actual hell.
After eleanor tells Cidi her secret that

43
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:18,064
she's there by mistake.
He decides to teach her to be a good 

44
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:24,310
person by conjuring up a chalkboard and 
giving her daily philosophy lessons.

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,443
This leads to some of the best 
philosophy jokes on television who died 

46
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:32,610
and left aristotle in charge of ethics 
play doll.

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,730
Oh,
and John,

48
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,920
you is actually Jason,
a trashy Florida,

49
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,110
want to be dj who is also there by 
mistake.

50
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,060
So he joins in on the ethics classes 
too.

51
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,400
This is your first step towards not 
sucking.

52
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,920
Cool.
I just have two questions.

53
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,150
One or football tryouts,
and does the school have a prom?

54
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,690
Oh No.

55
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,663
For most of the show,
eleanor's moral progress runs parallel 

56
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,430
to her ethics lessons.
The more she internalizes philosophy,

57
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,780
the more see her making decisions that 
are halfway decent,

58
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,763
if not downright suite.
The show at face value sets up the 

59
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,220
premise that learning ethics makes you 
act more ethically.

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,263
At least that's the premise the cheeky 
and eleanor are working from as he goes 

61
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:16,900
through the grueling task of teaching 
contractual ism to someone who abandoned

62
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,210
dog sitting duties to go to a rihanna 
concert.

63
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,520
You broke your promise as soon as it 
wasn't convenient for you,

64
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,850
and now I have a very full office dog.
That idea that learning moral philosophy

65
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:32,500
can make you a better person is an 
ethical theory in itself.

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,880
The question of whether or not ethics 
can make you a better person and if so,

67
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,900
what ethical system best accomplishes 
that is called Meta ethics.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,353
Fundamentally,
the good place is a show about Metta 

69
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:45,934
ethics even as it presents relatively 
straight forward ethical theories 

70
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,370
through cheeky and when cheeky teaches 
you ethics,

71
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,820
he goes hard.
Well,

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,270
now that you've become acquainted with 
existential crises,

73
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,560
I thought we could read death by 
philosopher Todd May.

74
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,453
Sounds like the perfect beach read.
Eleanor gets the rundown on rawls lock 

75
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,800
clout to Plato,
Sidgwick Mill,

76
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:07,730
hume,
Scanlan,

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,830
and quite a few other moral 
philosophers,

78
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,933
including todd may,
who just happens to be one of the 

79
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,600
philosophy consultants for the show.
Nice one time.

80
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,093
All of these competing philosophical 
concepts are meant to teach eleanor and 

81
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:21,380
Jason how to be moral enough to remain 
in the good place,

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,380
but as any ethics,
one o one student could tell you,

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,333
learning a bunch of contradictory 
theories on what makes someone act good 

84
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,410
does not actually help answer the 
question,

85
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,090
how the fork should I act?

86
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
Eleanor frequently expresses her 
frustration with this,

87
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,350
but she keeps on selfish.
Here's the perfect test.

88
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,303
There's something fun that you want to 
do and then there's something less fun 

89
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,064
that people are doing for the common 
good from the beginning of the ethics 

90
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,304
lessons.
These frustrations hint that the real 

91
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,674
question isn't which of these 
philosophers should I base my moral 

92
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,554
system on,
but rather is this the right way to 

93
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:55,880
learn how to be ethical in the first 
place?

94
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,923
After all,
gds inability to decide anything driven 

95
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:02,000
by his thorough knowledge of philosophy 
is his main flaw.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I miss my mom's back surgery because I 
had already promised my landlords nephew

97
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:09,530
that I would help him figure out his new
phone.

98
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:13,160
I don't need the Cidi who once had a 
panic attack during rock paper,

99
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:16,910
scissors because there were just too 
many variables.

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,310
The show progresses.
Eleanor becomes a decent person,

101
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,203
CIDI gets slightly better at making 
decisions and Jason Gets married to a 

102
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:24,810
robot.

103
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,190
Oh,
that's enough out of you.

104
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,410
Robot lover.
That's risk not a robot.

105
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,470
We're still not sure if that last one 
has any secret moral significance.

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,420
While you might say,
hey,

107
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,283
gds classes are helping.
It could be argued that eleanor and 

108
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:39,300
friends are progressing in spite of his 
philosophy class.

109
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,890
That's because there's a big difference 
between learning ethics and doing ethics

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,380
and here's where we get back to Meta 
ethics.

111
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,220
Those questions about what morality 
actually is and how we ought to approach

112
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,054
it.
There's actual data to support the idea 

113
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:58,101
that studying moral philosophy doesn't 
necessarily make you more contemporary.

114
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,114
Philosopher Eric Schwitzer level 
conducted a study between 2007 and 2009 

115
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,870
there resulted in a maybe not so 
surprising conclusion.

116
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,913
Ethics professors do non generally 
perform more ethically then they're not 

117
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:12,710
at the cyst and non philosopher peers.
In fact,

118
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,723
many of those peers belief that ethics 
professors actually performed less 

119
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,504
ethically than their counterparts.
This is consistent with the story of 

120
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:25,001
cheating who despite knowing a buttload 
about ethical theory ended up in the bad

121
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:28,460
place because of the people he 
unwittingly hurt through his struggle to

122
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,294
apply those theories.
This is why everyone hates moral 

123
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,170
philosophy professors.
Oh,

124
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,810
did we mention the good places?
Really the bad place.

125
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,763
We'll get to that.

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,693
I can't believe you figured it out.
[inaudible] also studied the effects of 

127
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:46,744
university level ethics classes on 
student behavior and concluded that 

128
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:50,644
there is little to no correlation 
between taking ethics classes and moral 

129
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,660
behavior.
Again,

130
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,880
not a shocker.
We often see eleanor struggling to weigh

131
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,820
competing theories when deciding how to 
act.

132
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:05,320
Irl comp says that lying is always wrong
and I follow that Max,

133
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:08,020
so you can't even lie to demons.
They're trying to torture us,

134
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:08,854
man.
We're behind enemy lines that suppose 

135
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,910
out principles when you pick and choose 
when you're going to follow them,

136
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,940
and she's actually trying,
which can't exactly be set.

137
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:16,774
A freshman and a fixed glass.
The Schwitzer Bible study even showed 

138
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:19,964
that ethics books go missing from the 
library more often than other kinds of 

139
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:25,120
philosophy books.
Draw your own conclusions on that one.

140
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,303
I might not have been a saint,
but it's not like a killed anybody 

141
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,980
wasn't an arsonist and never found a 
wallet outside of an,

142
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,830
I haven't thought about returning it,
but saw the owner lived out of state,

143
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,170
so just took the cash and drop the 
wallet back on the ground.

144
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,550
Okay.
That's really specific and that makes me

145
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,890
think that you definitely did do that.

146
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,763
Much of the shows,
comedy comes from the absurdity of what 

147
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,660
moral theory looks like.
One played out in reality,

148
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,070
whether that's the panic of indecision 
or the hilarity and Gore of the infamous

149
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,590
trolley problem happening with a real 
trolley.

150
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,310
Here are the lovers,
the switch,

151
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,710
the tracks that the choice.
The thing is,

152
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:02,711
I mean ethically speaking,
I mean on the one hand you're telling,

153
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,573
telling you

154
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,893
see some of the clearest moral 
improvement when the characters stop 

155
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,560
weighing choices based on theory and 
simply follow their gut,

156
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,400
which one of these confusing French 
books,

157
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,310
we'll make it normal again.
It's that easy.

158
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,263
I mean emotionally,
he's all over the map right now and I 

159
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,204
can't believe I'm saying this,
but I don't think this can be solved 

160
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:23,754
with a book.

161
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,653
This suggests that while the fact that 
eleanor is trying to be a better person 

162
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:29,970
is certainly helping her make better 
choices.

163
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,580
It's not the theories themselves,
the do the work.

164
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,040
It's a little more subconscious than 
that.

165
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,233
Eleanor's progress might be explained by
a Meta ethical concept called moral 

166
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,610
intuition,
ism moral intuition.

167
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:45,210
Ism aren't used that it's our intuitive 
awareness of what's right and wrong,

168
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,163
not book learning.
Then Sam's are ethical knowledge that 

169
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,674
might seem to be a problem for our main 
characters since none of them appear to 

170
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,470
have any moral intuitions whatsoever.
Plus here,

171
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,570
do you have a ton of preorders?
Here is your first cut of the profits.

172
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,990
Ho Lima,
Mum,

173
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,753
I can't believe you sold the tee shirt.
Does it help if they basically sold 

174
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,010
themselves?
However,

175
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,873
there are branches of moral intuition 
ism that suggest intuitions can change 

176
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,523
while memorizing q may nod,
zap eleanor into a perfect trim free 

177
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,310
angel.

178
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,143
It does open up a space for self 
reflection that was previously pretty 

179
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:24,930
close to off on kind of like a self 
improvement kick.

180
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,764
Do you think you could help me out?
Teach me to get all horny for the 

181
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,124
environment or whatever.
We could also read the show through the 

182
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:31,974
rules of Aristotle's virtue ethics.
The idea that the best path to morality 

183
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,490
is by following the example of virtuous 
people.

184
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,610
The good place does seem to make the 
case for the power of friendship,

185
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,540
but the problem with this theory is that
at least in the beginning,

186
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,750
there are no truly good people for any 
of them to copy.

187
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,050
So Cheeky Teaching Aristotle is actually
pretty ironic.

188
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,290
Things get really intriguing when 
eleanor goes back to Earth,

189
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,124
the end of season two from the get go,
she acts way more morally than she did 

190
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:00,354
in her old life.

191
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,900
Despite having zero memory of the lesson
she learned in the bad,

192
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,170
good place.
This suggests that those experiences,

193
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,280
whether with books or with her friends 
have ultra term moral intuitions,

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,270
even though she can't remember them.
Sure.

195
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,690
If she falls off the ethical wagon once 
or twice,

196
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,570
I quit eat my farts benedict 
cumberbatch,

197
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,730
but it doesn't take a lot of prompting 
from Michael.

198
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,590
The barkeep for her to seek out some 
help.

199
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,830
Something about eleanor is undeniably 
different.

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,873
Also,
I met Michael makes a mean screwdriver 

201
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,990
because of you know,
all the torture and stuff.

202
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,260
Although we aren't really going to talk 
about predestination in this video.

203
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,303
The ending of season two pretty much wax
you over the head with their answer to 

204
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,860
can people change?
Yes they can.

205
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,903
However,
this comes after an entire season of 

206
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,274
eleanor in the gang making similar 
decisions over and over and over times 

207
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:49,920
802 every time Michael resets their 
neighborhood.

208
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,550
So although we can make our own 
destinies changing habits,

209
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:57,150
sure is a bitch or bitch,
son of a bench.

210
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,073
Although we over here at wise crack 
think that the good place ultimately 

211
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:04,320
rejects the idea that teaching ethics 
directly leads to more ethical action.

212
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,333
It's not totally clear.
Gds lessons are no joke and the most 

213
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,084
profound evidence of that is in Michael,
who after just a few weeks of lessons 

214
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:17,421
becomes a decent person Ga's or at least
an honorary person.

215
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,650
If anyone send to fight off 
predestination.

216
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,560
It's that guy.
There's just one more thing,

217
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,330
one philosophical inspiration in the 
good place that no matter how tangential

218
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,164
it is,
your main argument we just have to talk 

219
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,564
about to show gets a lot of inspiration 
from a wise crack favorite John Paul 

220
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:41,310
Sarte.
So in season one the finale reveals that

221
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:42,144
they are all trash humans and the good 
place is really an experimental 

222
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,960
neighborhood in the bad place where 
Tahani Eleanor,

223
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:49,794
Jason,
and cheaty are meant to torment each 

224
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,590
other for all of eternity.

225
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,673
Michael,
the demon architect who designed the 

226
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:55,894
neighborhood has a theory that four 
carefully selected people will torture 

227
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,644
each other far more effectively.
Then butthole spiders were trying out 

228
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,050
the new butthole spiders.
They're enormous.

229
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,130
Eleanor unknowingly tortures cheaty by 
forcing him to make difficult choices.

230
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,023
His real life nightmare.
We are trapped in a warped version of 

231
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,080
niches,
eternal recurrence.

232
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,973
Oh cool.
More philosophy that'll help us cheaty 

233
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,800
tortures to honey by refusing to make a 
decision to pick her over eleanor,

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,790
a reminder of the second best status she
had with her sister before her death.

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,840
I get tired of objective representation.
I trust my audience,

236
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,850
my bed.
He has a hat.

237
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,900
Yes,
well done to honey.

238
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,510
The honey maybe knowingly tortures 
eleanor by providing a constant reminder

239
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:41,300
of how much better she is.
It's just so sweet,

240
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,370
teensy,
just like you,

241
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,780
your book.
To me,

242
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,480
that's fine.

243
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,313
And everything tortures Jason because 
all he wants to do is be himself and he 

244
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:59,071
can't even tell people his real name was
also,

245
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:00,844
he never got to see the Jacksonville 
Jaguars when their division title last 

246
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,323
year.
I'm not convinced that a life with no 

247
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:08,680
floor to dance crew will ever be scarier
than ask Arachnids.

248
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,930
But Hey,
I'm not a literal hell monster.

249
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,793
So what do I know?
Another way to read the first season is 

250
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,480
a modern retelling of philosophers,
John Paul Sartre.

251
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,500
No exit in it,
sorry.

252
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,353
Riffs on his famous idiom.
Hell is other people with three bags 

253
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:26,140
locked in a room in the underworld who 
make each other miserable through lies,

254
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,730
love triangles and everything you could 
imagine from people who ended up in well

255
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,653
hell and in season one,
the neighbors of the good place managed 

256
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,940
to make each other very,
very miserable.

257
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,610
It's important to clear up a common 
misconception.

258
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,803
Hell is not other people because someone
brought their crying toddler to see 

259
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,134
deadpool,
but because in no exit and in the good 

260
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,260
place,
you're a turtle,

261
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,260
neighbors will bring out what you hate 
most about yourself.

262
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,483
The torture is predicated not by say,
attending an eternal dinner party with 

263
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:55,744
people who use the word mouthfeel,
but by letting those people decide how 

264
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:02,050
you see yourself leading to the ultimate
existential as sin,

265
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,213
bad faith,
the similarities to no exit don't end 

266
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:09,610
with the dope existentialists themes.
Some of the characters themselves have a

267
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,980
lot in common with their good place 
counterparts.

268
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,143
I nez who describes herself as a damned 
bitch is pretty much the 1940s eleanor 

269
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,813
except a lot worse.
She turns people against each other for 

270
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,144
fun,
causes misery wherever she goes and 

271
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,990
thrives on her own.
Selfishness.

272
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,153
A stele is a high society socialite 
who's obsessed with her own beauty and 

273
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,384
wishes desperately for a mirror.
She insists that she does not belong in 

274
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,194
hell and for much of the play refuses to
believe that she was a bad person on 

275
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,330
earth.
I belong in the good place,

276
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,780
the real one with the good people.
Who do I speak to about correcting this?

277
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,010
Your role very well.
I would like to speak to your manager is

278
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:51,950
still snobbishness about the working 
class is more than a little familiar.

279
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,320
She's not used to dressing like a 
plumber.

280
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:55,154
Rats that when you call a female plumber
or is it a a toilet suite for or clunk 

281
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,180
winch.
In any case,

282
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,980
that's how I'm dressed.

283
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,913
She also murdered a baby,
which to honey has probably never done 

284
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,083
probably

285
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,690
we don't make any sense together and yet
when I'm with you,

286
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:16,870
I can really let my hair down,
my depart can speaking of course,

287
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,820
because I'd never had it up in the first
place.

288
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,000
G doesn't have quite the same amount of 
overlap with his counterpart Garsa,

289
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,760
but there are certainly some character 
traits that ring a bell.

290
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,310
Garcia is a coward which gets him 
killed.

291
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,950
And Gidi is terrified of making 
decisions,

292
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,260
which is just its own brand of 
cowardice.

293
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,630
Oh,
I'm sorry everyone.

294
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,493
I just have some worries as well as some
concerns that could potentially turn 

295
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:43,600
into outright fears.
Oh,

296
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,530
there they go.
Ah,

297
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,520
there,
there a few years now.

298
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,473
Well,
so remember how CIDI refuses to Pick 

299
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,720
Tahani over.
Eleanor totally happens and no exit.

300
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,943
Sadly there is no Jason God.
That play would be so much better with 

301
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,250
Jason.
Whoa.

302
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,980
What is happening?
She having an orgasm?

303
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,993
Did I do somehow?
So the good place is initially a show 

304
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:04,964
about hell being other people and also a
show about the philosophy of 

305
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:08,744
philosophies of which were discerning 
the philosophy of also probably 

306
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,160
something about Cacti.
But the real question to end on is this,

307
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,390
did watching this video on the ethics of
the good place make you a better person?

308
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,030
And if you didn't learn anything from 
this video,

309
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,880
well don't say we didn't try to save 
your ass.

310
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,163
Literally all of these lessons paid off.
Whoever said philosophy was stupid many 

311
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:33,644
times.
And if you want to make like your 

312
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:37,850
favorite anxiety driven professor and 
get your ethics on,

313

317
