00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,983
Hey,
wisecrack disembodied jared again here 

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,940
to continue our epic philosophy of 
Christopher Nolan trilogy.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,280
In our first installment,
Nolan begins.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,720
We covered his interpretations of the 
self in his early films plus inception.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,793
What does it mean to be a self?
How can we trust ourselves and our own 

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,174
thoughts?
Today we're asking if there's so much 

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,754
conflict already present in the self.
What are the implications for a 

8
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:30,870
community full of cells if we can't even
handle our own issues?

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,880
Is it possible to avoid conflict with 
other people or is violence inevitable?

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,983
This is the foundational questions 
surrounding Gotham City in the dark 

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,810
knight trilogy,
so suit up for some time with the Batman

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,733
and were not wearing hockey pads.
Welcomeness wisecrack addition on the 

13
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,450
philosophy of Christopher Nolan Park 
too,

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,960
and Yup,
there's spoilers ahead behind the face.

15
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,794
Paint and pointy eared masks.
Gotham is experiencing crisis after 

16
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,710
crisis that affect the functioning of 
its social body.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,890
The mob is pumping and drugs.
The cops are helping the mob.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,753
The mob is hiring.
Clowns and bomb seem to be getting 

19
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,160
trendier by the minute.
Batman may be the focus,

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,020
but his focus is on the city he loves.
In the process of saving Gotham,

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,260
the film's raised questions about the 
nature of community.

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,410
How does a society deal with fear and 
threats?

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,150
How does the presence of a hero like 
Batman creates or threatened stability?

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,193
Can Society wide conflict ever be 
resolved or is it inherently a cyclical 

25
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,080
process?

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,080
What about escalation escalation where 
you start tearing semiautomatics day bio

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,113
waste,
dod wearing Kevlar body armor piercing 

28
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:44,540
rounds,
and you're wearing a mask?

29
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,970
Jumping off rooftops,

30
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,810
help us understand Nolan's social 
philosophy.

31
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,810
We're turning to perpetually stoned 
looking anthropologists.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,673
Rene's Gerard Gerard claims that the 
concept of [inaudible] is both the 

33
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:58,054
foundation of all societies and the 
foundation of conflict in those 

34
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:02,404
societies.
Gerard's theory claims that one of the 

35
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,960
most basic aspects of our relationships 
with other people is imitation.

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,500
Imitation can be as simple as copying 
someone else's behavior.

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,530
I see you buying someone a bad ass 
necklace and I think,

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,730
wow,
great idea,

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,610
and I decided to go buy a necklace to 
everyone's happy,

40
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:21,100
right?
But this can become a problem.

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,340
Gerard says that imitation of someone 
else's behaviors can and often does lead

42
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,604
to replicating their desires.
That's where I don't just want a 

43
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:31,324
necklace.
I want that necklace to one you happen 

44
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:37,150
to be wearing.
This is mimetic desire and it can pretty

45
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:37,984
quickly lead to rivalry where multiple 
people share the same desire and so 

46
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,870
compete over finite resources.

47
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,883
Gerard claims that are human impulse 
toward imitation means that eventually 

48
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:49,474
more and more people will want that 
necklace and rivalries will grow and 

49
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:58,000
multiply until they're also profoundly 
impactful on the community itself.

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,133
When one succeeds in winning the prize,
the other people or their tribes or 

51
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,880
their surviving family members seek 
retaliation against the winter.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,073
This vengeance is also a form of 
imitation and it basically ensures that 

53
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,320
rivalries and violence will continue to 
grow.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,100
According to Gerard.
This is the fundamental reason why there

55
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,540
is crime,
violence,

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,380
and war in the world.
As Batman begins begins.

57
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,520
This turmoil is already established,
obviously because according to Gerard,

58
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,130
this cycle goes all the way back to 
cavemen,

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,293
but what's important to note here is 
that we see individual examples of 

60
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,860
mummies occurring and motivating 
characters and most importantly it later

61
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,694
on we see Nolan used mimetic theory to 
propose a possible solution to society 

62
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,770
wide violence.

63
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,170
So let's get started.
Let me.

64
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,450
This is most relevant in Batman begins 
as it relates to the individual,

65
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,390
especially in the creation of the Batman
identity.

66
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,680
The original instance of this,
this is one man's desire for the Wayne's

67
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,514
wealth,
which leads to violence throughout the 

68
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,670
film,
Nolan for grounds,

69
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,760
fear and vengeance as powerful 
motivators,

70
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,220
especially in a city as broken as 
Gotham.

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,430
We see this again in Bruce's imitation 
of his parents.

72
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,264
Killer Joe,
chill in his effort to exact vengeance 

73
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,713
versus time away from Gotham inspires 
him to move away from the cycle of 

74
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,390
vengeance that motivated him to avenge 
his parents.

75
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,343
Instead,
he uses invitation as a means of 

76
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,624
stopping violence.
His fear of bats leads him to adopt the 

77
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,894
identity of a bat,
but he uses this invitation as a means 

78
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,541
to spread the fear to criminals who now 
fear a different kind of back him

79
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,080
watching your seeking justice.

80
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,480
The League of shadows wants to press the
reset button on conflict by destroying a

81
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:56,200
society altogether,
but that's not really how it works.

82
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,243
The problem with their method is that 
watching people destroy each other 

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,740
doesn't actually do anything to decrease
violence.

84
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,663
It inflates it.
There's nothing for people to unite 

85
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:08,860
around,
so whatever survivors are left after the

86
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,694
fire of London or the black plague or 
the microwaving of Gotham art still 

87
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,284
going to be really pissed off.
So if the League of shadows gets it 

88
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,300
wrong,
what does Batman get right?

89
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,810
Even while Nolan presents us with the 
idea that it is difficult,

90
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,600
if not impossible to break away from 
violence.

91
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,510
Roost spends.
The majority of Batman begins struggling

92
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:32,170
to overcome both his fears and his 
impulse for vengeance.

93
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,940
It can't be personal where you're just 
vigilante.

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,153
In order to do that,
that man has to transcend the identity 

95
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,020
of Bruce Wayne and become something 
else.

96
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,913
And image in the collective 
consciousness that represents justice 

97
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,970
without personal motivation,
he has to become a symbol to be imitated

98
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,893
and it's this idea of symbols Gerard 
proposes that can break society out of 

99
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,454
violence.

100
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,990
Unlike the more individually focused 
themes of Batman begins.

101
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,853
The dark knight transitions to these 
social consequences of the rapid spread 

102
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,670
of rivalries and fear.
After the mobs ass whooping,

103
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,533
the city begins to push back against 
organized crime and the faces of this 

104
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,404
effort,
our Rv Dent new district attorney and 

105
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:19,271
got them White Knight and Batman.
The wait for it dark night while the bat

106
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:23,480
fights with battery and Harvard 
Lamborghinis Dent Fights,

107
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:27,500
crime using the law as his weapon.
The White Knight and the Dark Knight are

108
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:31,280
symbiotic ideas.
They both inspire imitation.

109
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,690
While dent inspires the rest of the city
government to aim for a safer Gotham,

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,130
Batman Inspires copycats in poorly 
conceived Halloween costumes.

111
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,083
Still those copycats are assigned and 
that the idea of Batman inspires hope 

112
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,020
among the citizens of Gotham.
It's also a sign that those citizens are

113
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:52,040
copying his tactic of replicating fear 
or at least trying to,

114
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,990
but the mob pushes back as mobs tend to 
do,

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,033
and the increasing escalation of 
conflict between the Knights and the 

116
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,060
criminals leads to Moroni.

117
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,893
Hiring the joker to kill Batman.
Part of the danger of the joker is that 

118
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,800
he only has power because of how afraid 
the mob is.

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,993
Listen,
I know why you choose to have these 

120
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,190
little group therapy sessions in broad 
daylight.

121
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,460
I know why you're afraid to go out at 
night.

122
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,503
Batman Strategy for fighting crime has 
created a monster one that feeds on the 

123
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:31,130
mimetic reproduction of fear that that 
man relies on.

124
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,570
So how can you break a cycle that has 
adapted to your methods of opposing?

125
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,793
Gerard tells us that when violence and 
vengeance become so great that they 

126
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,664
threatened the existence of the society,
the majority of people will quickly set 

127
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:44,834
aside their differences in order to 
sacrifice an individual the scapegoat 

128
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,800
whose death can restore temporary peace 
to the community.

129
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,670
Everyone agrees that the whole thing was
the scapegoats fault and Bam,

130
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,830
boom,
burned at the metaphorical steak.

131
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,693
And everyone chills out,
but since it's literally impossible for 

132
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:05,450
an immense social conflict to be 
entirely one person's fault,

133
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,900
the scapegoat is a lie and a pretty 
violent one at that.

134
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,943
So peace doesn't last long and 
eventually someone cupboards by 

135
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,194
neighbors necklace all over again.
Gerard says that since humans have an 

136
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,934
innate impulse toward violence and 
rivalry actually stopping those cycles 

137
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:24,380
of vengeance is basically impossible.
With one exception,

138
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,393
we can replace the scapegoat goat with a
Christ like figure who rejects violence 

139
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,450
and turn the other cheek,
and this could set a new imitative trend

140
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,313
of people desiring nonviolence,
Harvey Dent and his campaign for peace 

141
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:37,654
in Gotham appear to fill that role,
providing a Christ figure for the 

142
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,020
community to emulate.
I believe in Harvey,

143
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,413
even Batman who can only fight violence 
with violence supports a world where 

144
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,630
dent replaces him taking up the mantle 
of crime,

145
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,990
fighting without the need for grappling 
hooks them off.

146
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,170
I could never be your stance against 
organized crime.

147
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,350
It's the first legitimate ray of light 
and cousin in decades,

148
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,710
but the joker,
a representation of the true violence of

149
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,500
mankind shifts the course of the mimetic
rivalry.

150
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,640
And corrupts our Christ figure with a 
few oil drums and some sweet talk.

151
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,760
Once Harvey to face begins to imitate 
the joker,

152
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,300
embracing chaos and going after Gordon 
and the corrupt cops,

153
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,223
he becomes subject to the cycles of 
violence that the white knight was 

154
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,230
supposed to destroy.
So in order to restore peace to Gotham,

155
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,380
we turned to the time honored tradition 
of the scapegoat.

156
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,393
Gotham picks an individual.
You're not blames him for the current 

157
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,950
social ills in this case,
the crimes committed by two face and the

158
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,784
joker's presence and punishes him in 
order to end the intense rivalries that 

159
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,160
threatened the existence of the 
community.

160
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,263
They don't kill Bruce Wayne,
but they effectively killed the symbol 

161
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:52,440
of the bat and at least for a while and 
during the period where Batman is gone,

162
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,340
there is a time of relative peace and 
prosperity in the city,

163
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,640
but the scapegoat is always based on a 
lie.

164
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,623
The truth of the situation has to be 
unconsciously suppressed in order to 

165
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:04,524
achieve the desired effect for 
containing the violent impulses of 

166
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,400
humanity.
However,

167
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,234
this lie is unsustainable and this 
problem is the starting point of the 

168
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:13,740
dark knight rises.

169
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,900
Third film begins at a time of relative 
tranquility,

170
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,763
brought on and sustained by the lie of 
Harvey Dent's martyrdom and the 

171
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,690
scapegoating of Batman.
This is acknowledged by court,

172
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,073
wasn't needed anymore.
We want who just by recognizing the 

173
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:34,444
nature of the lie threatens the 
stability that depends on the mayor is 

174
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:40,410
going to dump him in the spring,
really,

175
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,450
but he's a hero,
a war hero.

176
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:44,284
This is peace time,
but while the dent act made possible by 

177
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:51,190
the demonization of that man has 
effectively ended organized crime,

178
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,100
there are other kinds of violence still 
at work in the city.

179
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,020
The social and economic inequalities 
which defined the third film as one form

180
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,240
of violence ends.
Another begins,

181
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,170
although it's hardly fair to say that 
social inequality is a new phenomenon in

182
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,240
Gotham.
[inaudible] were killed because of their

183
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:08,074
wealth,
but the disillusion of the mob means 

184
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:10,474
that the divides between the legitimate 
rich and the poor are once again in the 

185
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:17,170
spotlight and violent rivalry is 
inevitable.

186
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,330
I kind of wonder how you ever leave,
so for the rest like

187
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,533
the joker,
Bain is focused on revealing the 

188
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,830
violence that already exists in ordinary
people,

189
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,860
but while the joker explores the idea of
chaos,

190
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,290
Bain is interested in the concept of the
law.

191
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,453
There were big supplier with a false to 
stop tearing down this corrupt which 

192
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,613
undoes the piece that on that lie,
the disruption of the myth of the scape 

193
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:57,314
goat means that the sacrifice of Batman 
no longer serves its purpose and its 

194
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,250
disappearance no longer helps the city

195
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,760
because Batman's sacrificed himself in 
order to save the city from itself.

196
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,653
His return isn't as simple as hopping 
into a flying car and catching the bad 

197
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,004
guy to inspire the city.
He has to metaphorically come back from 

198
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,024
the dead,
which is shown in his ascent out of the 

199
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:27,694
pit.
There's probably a lot of birth 

200
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:32,410
symbolism happening as he climbs out of 
a hole into the sunlight.

201
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,303
But what's way more interesting is this 
explicit connection to rising from the 

202
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,450
dead and the comics.
The underground cave has another name,

203
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,493
the Lazarus pit.
If you're not up to date with your new 

204
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:44,404
testament stories,
Lazarus is a dude who died and Jesus 

205
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,120
brought him back to life.
Yes,

206
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,963
pretty much.
That simple,

207
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,130
he rose from the dead.
Coincidence,

208
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,440
probably not,
especially since later on,

209
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,830
Gordon reads a eulogy from a tale of two
cities which describes,

210
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,723
you guessed it,
be Christ like sacrifice of one of the 

211
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,210
main characters,
Nolan man,

212
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,980
you're killing it with these lit 
references,

213
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,650
and this leads us back to Gerard's 
Christ figure.

214
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,663
He claims that in order to have real 
lasting peace to remove our society and 

215
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:11,194
ourselves from the cycle of violence,
we need to set aside the myth of the 

216
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,323
scapegoat and embrace a figure who sets 
an example of selflessness that forms a 

217
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:22,390
new mimetic desire to be copied by the 
masses,

218
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,373
but even Gerard isn't sure that this is 
feasible if humans are driven by an 

219
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:27,934
innate desire for violence,
isn't realistic to hope for something 

220
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:31,744
different.
Gerard says that even in today's 

221
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,264
Christian communities,
people don't really follow Christ's 

222
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,280
example.
No one asks this question throughout the

223
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,114
trilogy is peace actually possible.
People battle their inner monsters and 

224
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,780
at the same time they're battling the 
monsters of Gotham,

225
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,990
but can either of these ever find true 
resolution?

226
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,200
It may appear that dent was a fake 
Christ figure.

227
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:56,740
At the end of the dark night,
while Batman becomes a legitimate Christ

228
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,660
figure at the end of the dark,
knight rises,

229
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,490
but is this really the case?

230
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,220
When Batman takes the bomb out over the 
ocean,

231
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,520
he saves the city from a very visible 
kind of violence,

232
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,540
the radioactive kind,
but the piece that follows is also based

233
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,070
in part on the lie that Batman 
sacrificed his life to save the city.

234
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,100
He gets a statue and the city gets a new
martyr,

235
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,233
but maybe the lie of Batman's death is 
outweighed by another trip that unliked 

236
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:23,824
end.
He really did fight violence with self 

237
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:28,480
sacrifice,
creating the potential for a new kind of

238
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,314
mimetic desire.
Anyone can copy his motivations even if 

239
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,090
atomic bombs are in short supply.

240
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,450
That was the point

241
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,240
and we see [inaudible] come full circle 
in Joseph Gordon Levitt character who is

242
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,360
revealed at the end of the film to be 
none other than Robin.

243
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,610
The fact that Robin is introduced and 
that Batman left him,

244
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:55,040
all of his crime fighting tools 
suggests,

245
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,820
but doesn't prove that piece may not 
last in Gotham,

246
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,030
so how do we maintain stability in our 
communities?

247
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,550
The openness of the ending person,
Italy,

248
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,413
robin in the bat cave and Batman all 
statute up lead us in a number of 

249
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:09,884
directions which is exactly Nolan's 
point is a scape goat myth or a lie 

250
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,013
necessary to maintain stability.
Can a Christ figure really inspire 

251
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,244
people to abandon their violent urges or
Ken Society never exist without 

252
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,770
conflict,
no matter what we do.

253
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,843
Is there always a future crisis on the 
horizon ultimately to the limits of 

254
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:30,254
human nature?
Prevent us from achieving lasting peace 

255
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,220
or does the human spirit's allow us to 
overcome whatever obstacles may arise?

256
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,040
No one's later films like interstellar 
and Dunkirk.

257
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,903
Give us a peek into the possibility of 
how and why we might transcend those 

258
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:45,524
limits like constructing new worlds.
Tune in next time and thanks for
