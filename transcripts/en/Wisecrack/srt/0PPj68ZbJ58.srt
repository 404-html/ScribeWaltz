1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,650
well it's always been a,
the big breakthroughs and transportation

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,150
has always been propulsion,
you know,

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,280
however you're gonna how you're going to
get the vehicle going from,

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,870
from the ground transportation side,
you know,

6
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:24,020
horse and buggies gave way to a steam 
engines,

7
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,220
locomotives,
to,

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,303
uh,
the first practical small gasoline 

9
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,770
engine and the cars first cars,
a steam ships,

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,660
sailing ships,
gave way to steam ships,

11
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:35,570
gave away to diesel and nuclear powered 
vessels.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,531
The,
uh,

13
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,364
the airplane started out as these tiny 
little engine's turning propellors to a 

14
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:44,720
turbo props and modern propeller 
airplanes to the jet engine,

15
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,640
advent of the jet engine,
turbo jets,

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,060
and then two turbo fans,
which were efficient enough to allow,

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,553
you know,
the air transportation system as it is 

18
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:54,044
today to develop same as rockets.
Rockets have remained fundamentally 

19
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,610
unchanged except for a few exceptions,
uh,

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,330
for the last almost 50 years.
And so,

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,540
uh,
for there to be a fundamental shift in,

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,423
in rocketry and getting into space,
there almost has to be a breakthrough 

23
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,034
and propulsion either and how to bring 
the price down or how to more 

24
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:15,070
efficiently get people up into space.
And that's,

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,943
as we talked about earlier,
the key barrier is the expensive a 

26
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:19,424
rocket.

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,353
It's a matter of getting enough energy 
to get off of the planet and into lower 

28
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:26,780
earth orbit.
You know,

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,613
it takes,
takes a fixed amount of energy to do 

30
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,450
that per massive payload.
And so that part is fixed.

31
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,460
But how you do that,
how do you get the energy,

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,353
how do you extract it from the chemical 
propulsion you're using or if you're 

33
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,160
coming up with a whole new way of doing 
it,

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,150
um,
you know,

35
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,983
the neatest thing about research and 
science is that we don't necessarily 

36
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,530
know what's going to come down the pike.
You know,

37
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:46,364
we think we know what we're working on.
Oftentimes discoveries are made when 

38
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,810
you're trying to discover something 
else,

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,673
you know,
you end up accidentally discovering a 

40
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:53,684
different thing.
And so one of those things might happen 

41
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,680
then enable us to have more efficient 
rockets.

42
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,030
I,
it's hard for me to,

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,920
to kind of guess what that might be.
