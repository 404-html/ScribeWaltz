1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,320
Hey wisecrack,
corporeal,

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,450
jared again,
since destiny two dropped.

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:09,840
We've been grinding over public events,
the crucible and strikes,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,853
oddly enough,
while playing and amazing thing 

5
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,164
happened.
There's an actual narrative to follow 

6
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:15,840
this time.
Sure.

7
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:20,130
The original had all the gramar cards,
but seriously time for that.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,460
This time we get a glimpse into the 
motivation of the Games and Agnes,

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,503
and it's not simple.
We're binge delusions of grandeur or 

10
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,500
monomaniacal madness.
Nope.

11
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,860
The main villain of destiny two is 
driven by the same thing that people run

12
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,460
on now,
pride and and woken list wisecrack quick

13
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,060
take on destiny two and as usual 
spoilers ahead.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,940
First things first,
a quick recap.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,150
Destiny two opens with dominance gall,
also known as Gary Today.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,410
No one is main is scary,
or is it something with a j.

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,480
The military leader of the cabal and his
crew,

18
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:57,314
the Red Legion assaulting the tower,
the last real city on earth dominance 

19
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,700
and his crew up steel,
the mystical light of the traveler,

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,623
a giant planet shape God and kidnap the 
travelers speaker who is a prophet of 

21
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:10,364
sorts,
you play as a guardian and are now 

22
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:14,210
screwed because without the travelers 
light,

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,073
you've become a mere mortal,
so you have to travel the galaxy to 

24
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,180
restore the travelers light and defeat 
dominance.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,253
Destiny has always been filled with 
Judeo Christian illusions and 

26
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,194
undertones.
The guardians are corpses brought back 

27
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:29,630
to life with the travelers light like 
Christian Salvation and resurrection and

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,464
the game all but says the travelers,
a god that sacrifices itself for the 

29
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:35,660
greater good of the universe.
All of the crucifixion.

30
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,000
It's sacrificed,
destroyed.

31
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,650
It's ancient enemy and brought light to 
the ghosts.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,800
The main character's,
the guardians of the travelers light may

33
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,960
as well be the guardians of God's 
defined light,

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,080
Aka his heavenly choir of angels.
Get it.

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,243
Guardian angels.
This light business is a pretty big 

36
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:56,384
theme in destiny.
The guardians are literally powered by 

37
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,020
light,
and when you die in destiny two,

38
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:03,710
we see your light fades away and what's 
the opposite of light?

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,853
Well,
darkness still not buying the biblical 

40
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,630
connection.
Consider this passage.

41
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,440
Ben spake Jesus again unto them saying,
I am the light of the world.

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,140
Either follow with me shall not walk in 
darkness,

43
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,003
but shall have the light of life.
The evil that the traveler fled in the 

44
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:22,550
original destiny was the darkness.
When you dive in destiny,

45
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:23,384
you saw the darkness consumed you.
The loss of light is the central theme 

46
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:28,184
in destiny.
Destiny two gets a little more specific 

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,730
and borrows heavily from a 340 year old 
epic poem by John Milton.

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,863
Paradise Lost Milton's poem traces the 
fall of Man and follow Satan on his 

49
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,394
journey to get revenge on God by 
corrupting his newly created paradise 

50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,380
and its inhabitants,
Adam and eve.

51
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,190
Destiny two seems inspired by one of 
Milton's central motifs,

52
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,870
the juxtaposition of light and dark.
Milton's angels are represented as light

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,540
because of the goodness and illumination
of God's grace.

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,523
Meanwhile,
the demons are described by a darkness 

55
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,823
and their absence of light dominance.
Gall in a way plays the role of Satan 

56
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,293
who's angel name was Lucifer or Latin 
for light bearer and goal is pretty 

57
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,580
fixated on sealing the travelers light 
traveler,

58
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,853
speaker.

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,780
While the parallels between God and 
Satan are intriguing,

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,930
they're pretty essential to 
understanding who you're fighting.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,153
According to the lead designer of 
destiny to Luke Smith Gall is motivated 

62
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:24,964
by a sort of inferiority complex.
Gall was an orphan space turtle raised 

63
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,410
to believe that the traveler messed up 
when he chose humanity.

64
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,483
Gol was taught to believe that he is the
greatest thing in the universe since 

65
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,784
Nutella.
He's here because he believes the 

66
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,214
traveler and choosing us made the wrong 
choice and destiny to gall intends to 

67
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,514
show the traveler the error of its ways.
It shouldn't be surprising that this is 

68
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,190
also Satan's motivation and paradise 
lost.

69
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,610
Lucifer is pissed that he was skipped 
over for that big promotion.

70
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,683
God gave the number two slot to his son,
and so he plots to burn down heaven and 

71
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,430
tempt man to turn away from God.
Gulpie comparison is pissed.

72
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,970
The traveler chose the guardians so he 
kicks them out of the tower and tries to

73
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,971
bend the traveler to his will,
the center of your God.

74
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,400
One thing that seems odd about goals,
motivation is the console galls,

75
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,760
adoptive father keeps telling him to 
stop messing around with the speaker and

76
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,594
just to take the light what is right and
take this eventually all kills the 

77
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,300
console and the speaker and takes the 
light.

78
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,750
If he took the light anyway,
why the hell did he kill the console?

79
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,990
Why did he wait so long?
The answer is complicated,

80
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,824
but to simplify,
Gol was holding out for recognition is 

81
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,790
seeking affection and love from a God,
but in a messed up way.

82
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,460
Recognition has a long philosophical 
tradition,

83
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,810
but we're going to talk about what it 
means for our old friend,

84
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,510
advil helm,
Hagle for Hagle.

85
00:04:58,511 --> 00:04:59,344
People desire a self,
a sort of consciousness or what some 

86
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:03,364
people call subjectivity,
and there are all sorts of steps that 

87
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:06,664
people take to achieve subjectivity.
Recognition takes place primarily 

88
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,370
through vision and in order for 
recognition to occur,

89
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,210
both subjects need to feel like one 
another are worthy of recognition.

90
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,523
Most people aren't reassured by a thumbs
up from Charles Manson because it 

91
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,540
doesn't exactly scream you're doing the 
right thing,

92
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,210
but a thumbs up from a role model or a 
God,

93
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,610
well that gives you all the warm and 
fuzzies.

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Gall is searching for validation from 
what he considers to be an equal because

95
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,510
well goal is basically a god given that 
he is the emperor of the cabal.

96
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,703
Golf motivation for recognition comes 
from the fact that he was a runt and an 

97
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,100
orphan who was cast aside and abandoned 
even giant space.

98
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:48,934
Turtles have low self esteem.
I guess dominance hopes that in 

99
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,054
decimating the Guardian's he will show 
the traveler that he's deserving of the 

100
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,300
light and he'll be recognized as a true 
subject worthy of protecting the light.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,270
He's willing to do pretty much anything 
like [inaudible].

102
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,113
I crucify the speaker in order to get 
that sweet light or really got like 

103
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,410
immortality.
He'll even blow up the sun.

104
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,370
Fourth Gall believes he is worthy 
because all the sacrifice that he's gone

105
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,760
through because the guardians were just 
picked willy nilly in destiny.

106
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,210
One goal doesn't believe the guardians 
have sacrificed anything,

107
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,443
and in a way gall is right.
I mean the guardians were endowed with 

108
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,210
immortality at random.
They don't have any fear of death.

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,400
They didn't pull themselves up by their 
space,

110
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:38,100
boots or anything.
They just sort of got lucky.

111
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,910
We're makes your guardians worthy of 
devotion.

112
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,793
Self sacrifice.
Speaker is the face of devotion 

113
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,513
sacrifice,
so when the speaker tells him that the 

114
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,214
traveler has never spoken to him and 
that there's no chance in hell he will 

115
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:09,240
ever get the light golf flips out,
kills the speaker and takes any way,

116
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,343
even though golf said word for word,
I will not take the light or a remote 

117
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,980
force too,
so would be twisted faith.

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,390
It's here.
That goal becomes the villain of Destin.

119
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,990
Once he killed the console and the 
speaker and takes the light.

120
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,973
He rejects the recognition model that 
Governs Hegel's ethics and go straight 

121
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:36,360
to thievery and university domination in
a full circle moment.

122
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:40,860
He replicates Satan's biggest sin,
the Hubris to believe that he could ever

123
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,490
be an equal to God.
So when goal is killed in the last fight

124
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,610
and resurrects as a giant marshmallow 
God thing,

125
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,670
he has to ask if the traveler finally 
recognizes him,

126
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,910
if he finally sees him,
but the traveler can't see him.

127
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,050
So there you have a tale of Hubris and 
recognition.

128
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,690
Personally,
I love the strong narrative component of

129
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,524
destiny too,
but I also love just aimlessly walking 

130
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:08,130
around killing stuff and picking up 
loot.

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,890
I love the microtransactions a little 
less,

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,473
but what do you guys think?
Should the game stick to the basics or 

133
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:16,410
explore more of these themes in the 
future?

134
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,480
Thanks for watching guys.
Piece.

135
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,230
Thanks for watching.
Wise crack.

136
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,283
If you're able to tear yourself away 
from destiny two and are looking for 

137
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:24,414
more smart content,
I recommend checking out our friends 

138

They dive into the movies and TV shows.

concept and technique you've might've 
missed the first time around.

141
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,963
We've really enjoyed their game of 
thrones house symbolism series where 

142
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:41,220
they've been studying the origins and 
histories of George Rr.

143
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,054
Martin is beloved characters and 
analyzing some of the differences 

144
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,100
between how the families are depicted in
the books and the show,

145
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,293
especially now the season seven is over.
