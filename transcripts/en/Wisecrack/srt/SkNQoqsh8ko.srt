00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,080
This video is brought to you by 
skillshare.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,790
Yeah,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,140
a wise crack.
Jared,

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,060
again,
as you probably know,

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,050
the Internet is obsessed with fantasy 
life analysts was wrong.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,540
Wife analysts was right.
The philosophy of Santos,

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,570
Hey,
wait a second.

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,403
Even showed up in fortnight,
but aside from infinity war grossing 

9
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:26,720
more money than the entire GDP of Belize
and Josh Brolin being a bad ass.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,930
Why is this fill in the most ubiquitous 
since this dude,

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,193
after all,
not all diabolic plans get this much 

12
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:36,610
internet debate.
Oh hell,

13
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:37,444
let's just do it.
We always do hijacks Jackson nuclear 

14
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,330
weapons and hold the world hostage.
Well,

15
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,030
after a classic wisecrack brainstorm 
session,

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,440
I eat unsafe amounts of caffeine.
We've come up with a possible answer.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,700
It all has to do with the transition 
from this to this nanos.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,703
Welcome Liz.
Wise crack edition on this very 

19
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:59,300
distinguished Chin and spoilers for 
infinity war and the comics ahead.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,800
It's important to note that the 2018 
pianos isn't to fan,

21
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:07,690
knows has always been a comic book fan.
I was was created by Jim Starlin in 1973

22
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:10,410
and issue number 55 of the invincible 
Ironman,

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,370
and he immediately became a hit with 
readers in part due to.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,980
Well,
the outright weirdness of his cars.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,993
You see everything comic book Fan Ost 
did he did to impress the object of his 

26
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,000
affection,
marvel's personification of death,

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,073
who appears as a robed female skeleton 
who doesn't really talk a lot and 

28
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,870
wouldn't you know it.
She's just not into him,

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,230
but maybe if he defeats one more 
adventure or conquers one more planet.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,250
So you're telling me there's a chance.

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,263
Yeah,
like his later counterpart Comic Book 

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,500
Vanos is definitely a product of his 
era.

33
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,543
America in the late sixties and early 
seventies seemed to be infused with 

34
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:54,310
debt.
Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr

35
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:59,260
were slain in 68,
between 1968 and 1972 over a hundred and

36
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,094
30 American commercial airplanes were 
hijacked with many of these hijackings 

37
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:08,170
ending in fatalities.
By 1973 over 58,000

38
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:12,640
American soldiers had died in Vietnam 
that had infested our culture.

39
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,580
Why not have a super villain lust after 
her?

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,080
It's not the first time art has lusted 
after death in many ways.

41
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:20,914
Comic Book Vanos with his obsessive form
of Necrophilia hearkens back to an 

42
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,163
earlier time when obsessions like his 
were all the rage he fits right in with 

43
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:33,160
the capital are romantics of the 19th 
century.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,113
The poets like Lord Byron,
John Keats and Percy shelley depth was 

45
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:40,000
nature at its most glorious and 
triumphant,

46
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,043
keats himself and used on being half in 
love with death and it's no surprise 

47
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:48,010
that the greatest American poet from 
this era is Edgar Allen Poe,

48
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,963
the man who invented the spirit of hot 
topic hundreds of years before it 

49
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,950
manifested itself in every mall across 
America.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,840
And in this vein,
Comic Book Fan.

51
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,674
Osu is a romantic 100 percent angsty 
banjos once the whole universe to feel 

52
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,064
his pain.
But if comic book Fan Ost Living His 

53
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,034
passion driven emo life dovetailed 
nicely with be so full sleep heart at 

54
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,170
seventies,
how would he fair?

55
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,004
Now,
while today's America certainly has its 

56
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,930
own boogeyman,
death isn't really one of them.

57
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,350
Sure there's terrorism,
but the fears of the information age are

58
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,310
more analytical,
more driven by endless streams of data,

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,510
whether it be 24 hour news cycles or 24,
our social media feeds,

60
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,403
oh God.
Just thinking about it gives me a panic 

61
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,300
attack.
So marvel had to augment Thanos.

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,233
Specifically,
they had to tinker with primary 

63
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,990
motivation,
keep him in obsessive lunatic,

64
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,853
but changes obsession from death,
which is so retro to data retain his 

65
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,130
distinctive costume and appearance.
Sure.

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,780
Even keep the tire tracks on that sexy 
Chinet,

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,633
his Butler bottom eyes,
all the fields cinematic banjos in 

68
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,330
contrast to his four color antecedent is
not impulsive at all.

69
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,660
He rarely even raises his voice as 
befitting to our era.

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,553
Cinematic Banjos is a rationalist 
historically rationalism first rose to 

71
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,610
prominence during the 17th and 18th 
centuries.

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,713
This is Galileo pushing back at the 
church about the movement of the earth 

73
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,760
around the sun.
This is Newton deducing,

74
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,550
the three laws of classical mechanics,
pascal,

75
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,530
furthering our understanding of 
geometry,

76
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,740
the salient furthering our understanding
of human anatomy.

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,670
It's descartes proclaiming,
I think therefore I am not.

78
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,504
I feel,
but I think these are the men and women 

79
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,170
who pushed against all emotional 
distraction in order to achieve a higher

80
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,004
truth.
So Berlin goes about his business with 

81
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,064
the detachment of a rationalist.
It explains how he's able to murder his 

82
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,263
own daughter for the sake of achieving 
his utilitarian solution to 

83
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,060
overpopulation,
erases every other man,

84
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,470
woman,
and child from existence,

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,730
and justifies it to cold logic.
So why this change?

86
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,400
Is it just a sign of the times?
Well,

87
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,234
maybe,
but there's also a second reason to 

88
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:57,874
highlight the flaws of Tony Stark in his
seminal work on literary criticism 

89
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,484
poetics.
Aristotle claims that effective 

90
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,830
antagonists act not only in opposition 
to the hero,

91
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,370
but also reflect a vital flawed aspect 
of the hero.

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,593
This is the literary theory of foils,
Hamlet's self righteousness is so 

93
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,840
complete that it compels him to deceive 
and kill,

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,660
but the same could be said of his enemy,
Claudius,

95
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,543
hey,

96
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,883
you killed my father.
Absent Fathers Syndrome leads both Luke 

97
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,334
skywalker and Darth vader to make some 
very bad decisions and Sour Mon is 

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,000
little more than Gandalf,
fallen from grace.

99
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,820
And so when we apply poetics to 
avengers,

100
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:43,654
infinity,
war,

101
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,493
we discover why big,
bad thing I was had to be a rationalist 

102
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,340
because our protagonist Tony Stark is 
one to granted.

103
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,540
Tony Stark has his moments of being 
overtaken with emotion.

104
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,310
He begins his first movie as a carefree 
rich boy arms dealer.

105
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,860
Later events shake him out of his 
comfort zone.

106
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,783
So much so that by iron man three,
he's so overcome with the emotional 

107
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:08,240
aftermath of a near death experience 
that he's more or less crippled.

108
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,403
From there,
he ping pongs back to the security of 

109
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,014
stubborn rational thinking,
and it's in this headspace that he 

110
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:18,590
creates ultron and advocates for the 
Sokovia accords documents like that.

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,090
Documents which exists solely to enforce
order or rationalist best friend,

112
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,310
which brings us to infinity war.

113
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,530
Remember Tony Solution to defeating 
Thanos?

114
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,890
He's going to secure Dr.
strange if he can keep the analysts from

115
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,724
acquiring the time stone,
the infinity gauntlet can't be 

116
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,604
completed.
It's so mathematical that even Sheldon 

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,570
Cooper would have no.
No.

118
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,130
Jerry,
no more big bang theory jokes.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,320
It's an elegant,
logical strategy.

120
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,190
It is rational and it fails utterly.
Of course it does.

121
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,173
A need for rational solutions is the 
vital flawed characteristic that Tony 

122
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,434
has in common with Vanos.
Aristotelian storytelling demands that 

123
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,630
Tony Fail,
but hold on.

124
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,690
It's not as if Tony Stark is the only 
character in the movie.

125
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,763
In fact,
one could argue that the true beating 

126
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,750
heart of the mcu belongs instead to 
captain America himself.

127
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,613
Steve Rogers,
it Steve's emotional fortitude which 

128
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:12,230
finally brings the avengers together.
Rescues the winter soldier from darkness

129
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,840
and denies the confines of the Sokovia 
Corps.

130
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,880
Steve Rogers is marvel's capital.
Our romantic hero is driven by loyalty,

131
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,310
honor,
and his own principles,

132
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,010
romanticism versus rationalism.

133
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,060
It's this age old duality which forms 
the core of the Tony Stark,

134
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,760
Steve Rogers,
antagonism from the moment they meet,

135
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,110
it forms the foundation of their 
separate attempts to stop vanos stark.

136
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:36,944
The rationalist tries to out strategize 
him while Roger's the romantic tries to 

137
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,700
beat him up with an army and they both.
It's not just that they both fail,

138
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:47,414
that's important,
but that the only way they can come up 

139
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:54,230
with to solve a complicated problem is 
two diametrically opposed worldviews,

140
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,360
rationality,
or romanticism.

141
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,613
Having to choose between two extremes is
a defining characteristic of infinity 

142
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,320
war.
The avengers can either a,

143
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,273
let vision live and risk vanos getting 
the milestone or be killed her best 

144
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:11,360
friend and stop Nanos or look at Dr.
strangest dilemma.

145
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,253
He can either let Tony Stark die and 
perhaps defeat pianos or give it up and 

146
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,694
save Tony and let half the world die.
He tries to use the time stone as a way 

147
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,160
to defeat nanosecond.

148
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,093
After exploring 14 million options,
only find success once one in 14 

149
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,310
million.
Dr.

150
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,820
Strange then gives up the time stone and
save stark.

151
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,873
Now we can assume that this rational 
choice that strange makes is necessary 

152
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,104
toward that one in 14 million success,
but right now it sure looks awful 

153
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:40,424
because it allows our villain to win 
being stuck between option a and option 

154
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,820
B is stenosis.
Whole Shtick,

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,953
a man who literally control space and 
time can somehow only think of two 

156
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,890
outcomes in response to dwindling 
resources.

157
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,420
Let overpopulation run its course 
through war,

158
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,290
famine,
and misery,

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
or kill half the world.
He couldn't just snap his fingers to 

160
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,650
make more food,
resources or even planets to live on,

161
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,603
but as a reflection of modern society,
this is exactly the point and perhaps 

162
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:14,451
why fantas resonates so much in 2018,
as Maggie asked her recently observed in

163
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,490
the New York Times,
our life expectancy is declined.

164
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,670
Suicide rates have risen.
The opioid crisis has worsened.

165
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,623
Inequality has grown in confidence in 
government has fallen when confronted 

166
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,720
with the enormous problems of our modern
world.

167
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,703
It seems like every choice is damned if 
you do damned if you don't work a job 

168
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:35,040
that pays,
be miserable or work a job you love.

169
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,993
Be Poor and miserable.
Vote for a Douche or vote for a Turd 

170
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,700
Sandwich.
It seems like in many facets of life,

171
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,800
we're given the options of Pepsi and 
coke,

172
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,300
but no RC cola Bago boil on Fox and park
or Moxie,

173
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,433
and that's the problem with Dan knows 
when you're a political imagination is 

174
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:56,250
so limited and you only have a choice 
between two things.

175
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,180
All the rationality and the world isn't 
going to help you make progress.

176
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,510
In order to do that,
we need more imagination.

177
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,533
Whoa,

178
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,243
and what our political imagination is,
so she will never experience the joy of 

179
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:11,564
Phaco.
Is there any escape Hegel road that 

180
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,320
oftentimes in history the way forward 
come,

181
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,163
so when we take two diametrically 
opposed things and synthesize them into 

182
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,374
a fresh approach.
This is probably what lays before us in 

183
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:24,744
avengers four.
This is probably how our heroes will 

184
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:29,960
ultimately defeat banjos and saved the 
universe as they say.

185
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,590
When the old tricks fail,
you got to come up with new tricks.

186
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,880
As always,
guys,

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
thanks for watching.
Peace

188
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,310
intern interns clean this up.
This is ridiculous.

189
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,070
As your boss clean this up.

190
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,693
Let's see if skillshare can help build 
your business using company values to 

191
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,130
drive success.
Crucial conversations,

192
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:02,640
tools for talking with stakes are high.
What great managers do different.

193
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,420
Alright guys,
I get it.

194
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,490
I haven't been a leader that you guys 
need me to be,

195
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,533
but I am going to create a high 
performance company culture here wise 

196
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,480
and I will

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,720

198
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,850
and Nachos.

199
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,530
Clean the barricade.
We'll talk you.

200
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,460
Where did you learn to do all of this?
Well,

201
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,294
I went to sk l dot s h slash wise.

wisecrack nine.

209
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,730
