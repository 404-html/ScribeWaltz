This video is brought to you by

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,710
Hey wisecrack.
It's brainy.

3
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:09,850
Jared here,
Helen,

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,923
and today we're talking about the first 
season of one of the most cerebral 

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:17,840
enemies out there.
Psychopaths tonight,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,550
not just cut a when you kiddish data,
so no,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,920
she still sick and each coteau auto to 
go to her daycare.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,700
What about yours?
Is the digital economy in?

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,780
Yeah,
they're talking to each other by quoting

10
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:36,614
philosophy and it's amazing.
Set in a dystopian Japan where 

11
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,710
everything is controlled by a seemingly 
omniscient computer.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,603
The civil system,
psychopaths asked some pretty hefty 

13
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:47,180
questions.
Mainly,

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,540
is it possible for a computer to 
determine everything about us?

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Does she could see it so she didn't get 
a sick guy just against this,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,833
and more importantly,
would we want to live in a society 

17
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:15,061
without freewill?
I don't cook with.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,460
Does she get out?
She didn't know that well,

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,943
as it happens,
this question isn't just about 

20
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,670
philosophy,
but also science.

21
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,370
So sit down,
shut up and let disembodied.

22
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,204
Helen,
explain how the civil system just might 

23
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:42,900
suggest that freewill is a neurological 
and societal illusion in this wise crack

24
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:47,320
addition on the science and philosophy 
of psychopaths and cues.

25
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,300
Sirens.
That's what we do with spoilers,

26
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,134
right?
Also covering all the sexy smart stuff 

27
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,400
in this series would be impossible to do
in one video,

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,380
so if you want to hear jared break it 
down some more,

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,060
let us know in the comments.
First,

30
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,010
a quick recap.
For the uninitiated.

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,053
In the world of psychopaths,
the civil system determines everything 

32
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,594
about you from your job to the 
likelihood that you'll commit a crime 

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,810
all by constantly scanning your brain 
and keeping you under surveillance.

34
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,823
This handy Dandy all encompassing 
reading is called your psychopaths and 

35
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:18,700
it's what the civil system uses to make 
all these decisions about you

36
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,910
email system in your home that you knew.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,593
Enter a Kanye soon,
amaury a Newbie inspector at the 

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,400
Criminal Investigations Department or 
CID.

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,150
It's kind of like being a cop,
except instead of following the law,

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
you're following the systems,
directions,

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,460
demo mother that she beat us.
You still couldn't,

42
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,923
and instead of police dogs,
you get enforcers who were basically 

43
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:54,864
would be criminals that the system has 
granted limited freedom to in exchange 

44
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,860
for.
Well not a lot.

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,150
You might think that a legal system 
based off a computer scanning your brain

46
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:07,984
is some minority report level bull.
You have free will so you shouldn't be 

47
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,300
arrested before you actually commit a 
crime.

48
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,140
Right?
Well,

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,080
let me stop you right there.
As psychopaths illustrates,

50
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,210
it's not quite that simple.
First,

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,860
we have to understand what the brain and
the decision making process really is.

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,430
Most neuroscientists today think there 
are two systems in the brain.

53
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,240
The first system is us.
That little voice in our heads,

54
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,280
those emotions,
we feel all those thoughts.

55
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,570
We think it's the stuff we're actually 
aware of when we make a decision.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,540
This is the system where we like to 
think it happens,

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,770
but that's not entirely the case.
Below this system is another system,

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,783
a huge lattice work of neurons that 
controls everything from spatial 

59
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:50,710
processing to breathing.
Importantly,

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,990
this second system is a black box.

61
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,570
No matter how much armchair 
philosophizing we do,

62
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,523
we can't penetrate it,
and this is where the science of free 

63
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,370
will comes in.
See,

64
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,233
in the 19 eighties,
Dr Benjamin Lavette conducted a pretty 

65
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,474
groundbreaking experiment.
He asked subjects to look at a clock 

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,013
then at a time of their own choosing,
flick the wrist labelle then recorded 

67
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:12,304
the electrical impulses from their brain
called the readiness potential and 

68
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,700
compared it with the time the subjects 
believed they made the decision to flick

69
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,534
their wrist.
The results readiness potential 

70
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,324
proceeded the subject's awareness of 
making the decision by about half a 

71
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,800
second.
In other words,

72
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,783
the decision to flick their wrist 
happened somewhere in the unconscious 

73
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:34,120
system about half a second before they 
thought they made the decision.

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,213
Kind of like funder following lightning 
and while labettes experiment wasn't 

75
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,110
without flaws like how he relied on self
reporting,

76
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,003
it's important to note that other 
researchers have borne out similar 

77
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:44,914
results and experiments that were better
controlled when we can't say for sure 

78
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,840
that there's a causal relationship here.

79
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,793
We can say that on some level it looks 
like the decision making process begins 

80
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:57,610
in this unconscious part of the brain,
which makes you wonder,

81
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,020
are we really completely in control of 
the choices we make and if we're not,

82
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,973
how can we say their ours labettes 
experiment goes a long way in making 

83
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,320
sense of psychopaths is world.
After all,

84
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,190
why would anyone let a computer make a 
preemptive judgments about them ordering

85
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,200
every facet of their lives?
Well,

86
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,093
because a very smart computer like the 
civil system can have a deep 

87
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,634
understanding of the brain's black box 
in a sense knowing is better than we 

88
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:21,964
know ourselves held.
The system knows the inner workings of 

89
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:24,844
the unconscious mind so well that it can
even identify likely criminals as 

90
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,354
toddlers,

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
both either cycle bus as she got a coco 
and you do in a

92
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,523
sense the relationship between the civil
system and its citizens is parallel to 

93
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:45,230
the relationship between the two systems
in our brain,

94
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,600
the citizens mole about with other 
feelings,

95
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:48,434
thoughts,
and seeming choices while literally 

96
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,870
thousands of feet below their feet is a 
vast network of sensors,

97
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,970
processors,
and fiber optic cables.

98
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,840
All in charge of them,
but if our unconscious mind is affecting

99
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,890
our conscious decisions,
we have to wonder what then is affecting

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,753
our unconscious mind.
If we're here subliminal messages 

101
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,120
saying,
Love Logan,

102
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,220
Paul,
are we actually going to like him?

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,353
Unsurprisingly,
the civil system takes the question of 

104
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,070
what can affect its citizens minds very 
seriously.

105
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,143
The system is practically obsessed with 
keeping the mental states of its 

106
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,110
citizenry,
squeaky clean,

107
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,280
so much so that it measures the stress 
levels of public spaces constantly.

108
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,620
Imagine walking around the mall 
peacefully,

109
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:31,940
minding your own business when you're 
psychopaths reading changes and this guy

110
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:35,390
comes up to you with this obsession of 
keeping its citizens healthy.

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,313
It's also not surprising that the system
will also black out the press for the 

112
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,974
public good consumers and it goes 
without saying that other forms of 

113
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:51,140
expression like music and art are also 
limited.

114
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,500
This is pretty much an Orwellian 
nightmare of the first degree,

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,950
but as the simple system wrong to 
control freedom of speech

116
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,090
because you're a to you guys to go with 
you so you can join or

117
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,890
homelands handled.
Chibe,

118
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,440
does she still have some on some other,
as frightening as it may sound,

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,100
science at least might say no.
As it turns out,

120
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,910
human beings are world class imitators.
We're so good.

121
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:22,744
In fact,
that we do it innately without even 

122
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,144
realizing it.
Research performed by Andrew Meltzoff 

123
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,180
has shown that infants imitate even the 
most ludicrous of actions.

124
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,070
Fourteen month olds,
for example,

125
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,963
we'll do dumped like use their foreheads
instead of their fingers to turn on the 

126
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,490
touch sensor light simply by watching an
adult do it.

127
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,623
Now,
there's evidence to suggest that 

128
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:42,334
children are such good imitators because
the parts of their brain that control 

129
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,874
inhibition aren't fully developed,
but just because we're not wearing 

130
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:52,660
diapers doesn't mean adults are any less
likely to imitate their peers.

131
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,853
In fact,
humans are so susceptible to imitation 

132
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,993
it just perceiving an action performed 
by another person will drastically 

133
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,750
increase the likelihood of them 
emulating it.

134
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,943
This is called the chameleon effect,
and it has to do with a special set of 

135
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:06,784
brain cells called mirror neurons,
which fire when we watch others' 

136
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,263
performance action.
This goes on during all of our 

137
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,380
interactions without us ever noticing 
it,

138
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,423
and that's the key takeaway.
It happens automatically and 

139
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:22,150
subconsciously it happens in that 
impenetrable system of our brain.

140
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,380
So why would the symbol system need to 
crack down on crime before crime happens

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,333
because behavior is contagious and that 
means everything from laughing to 

142
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:33,460
violence and when we're exposed to the 
ladder,

143
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,370
even in the regular world,
there are consequences,

144
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,400
and this seems to be the case in the 
world of psychopaths.

145
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,323
When the city is flooded with low grade 
criminals wearing helmets that stopped 

146
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:45,070
the civil system from reading,
they're psychopaths.

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,480
We see violence spread to the normal 
citizens within almost gleeful contagion

148
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,840
cycle.
Have a good one,

149
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,410
nosy,
go,

150
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,890
go to Korea.
Both ads about it.

151
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:04,160
They didn't know what hit them at the.
She was,

152
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,170
like I said,
I go to the shoot on bulk or Chico state

153
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:09,560
or

154
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,393
so.
Whether it's in your brain or on the 

155
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,540
streets,
it's clear that the civil system is bent

156
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,580
on removing agency from its citizens.

157
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
She be done.
Okay.

158
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,543
Eight kids still as you want a night 
sort of kids done three ish almost 

159
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,230
today,

160
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,470
and this is where we get to the question
at the heart of psychopaths.

161
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,340
What is the value of living in a society
without freewill?

162
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,210
It's exactly this question that drives 
showgirl Moxie map.

163
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,113
This first seasons antagonist maximized,
driven to test the value of freewill in 

164
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,580
a society where it's been rendered,
meaningless

165
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,680
selling them.
I just don't know to Thomas,

166
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,520
he knew he needed community today.
Geeky stuff,

167
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,803
so no hunting touch you.
I know annual [inaudible] your needs in 

168
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:05,711
Taco bell could still no Thomasina sort 
of got home.

169
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:12,170
Tony told him I.
he's your typical Tomas.

170
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,260
Islam told us touching.
It cuts you out

171
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,240
in positing the necessity of freewill.
Mark Shimo borrows a page from wisecrack

172
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,083
favorite Emmanuel Kant,
who believes that you can only be moral 

173
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:29,650
by following moral laws out of your own 
free will and Moxie.

174
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:32,700
Mark goes to insane links to see the 
worth of people's will.

175
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,683
Enabling criminal after criminal who 
wants to test their will against the 

176
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,340
system.
But Mark Shima is the batty.

177
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,263
So does that mean a believes?
The opposite is she the symbol systems 

178
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,344
number one fan going all in for the 
belief that freewill must be squashed 

179
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,170
for the greater collective good.
Well,

180
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,093
not really.
Throughout the series a connie displays 

181
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
a unique sense of individualism.
She was such a good student that the 

182
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,650
system determined she'd be a good fit in
literally any industry.

183
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,080
So look,
get the.

184
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,373
And after she joined the CID,
a Conay early on questions the merit of 

185
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,450
blindly following the civil systems 
orders,

186
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,040
culminating with her disobeying her 
bosses order to kill her enforcer,

187
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:20,940
Shinya Coca,
me,

188
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,640
Hon.
Xy cases that take your assignments.

189
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,310
And although she begrudgingly allows the
system to remain by the end of the first

190
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,590
season,
she does so on her own terms,

191
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,573
each that I see me.
Do you want me to get any city in this 

192
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,341
sense?
Uh,

193
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,200
Connie represents a sort of middle 
ground.

194
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,213
Sure.
Maybe the unconscious mind or the civil 

195
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,584
system influences her decisions,
but ultimately they're still hers to 

196
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:50,310
make despite reaffirming a system that 
strips her of some agency.

197
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,233
Uh,
Connie herself manages to preserve the 

198
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:54,880
semblance free will.
But in the end,

199
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,100
a con,
I can't actually stop mocks Yuma.

200
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,053
That role falls to Kokanee.
Now we could say a lot about why 

201
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,130
Moctezuma values Koga me so much more 
than a connie,

202
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,113
but I think it has to do with this by 
letting the civil system dictate your 

203
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:29,684
life.
Mcsema believes you stop becoming an 

204
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,160
individual without free will.
You're not a human,

205
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,320
but merely a cog in the machine.
Maybe this is why.

206
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,163
Kogi,
the man who willing to live as a 

207
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:40,244
fugitive from the system in order to 
stop mock Cima is the only one mcsema 

208
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,260
cares about.
By the seasons end.

209
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,720
Cogan may is the only one who acts 
freely,

210
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,763
and in this sense,
he's the only one mock Shima has a real 

211
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,400
relationship with in this world.

212
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,710
Both

213
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,400
what makes the world of psychopaths so 
frightening is that unlike other shows,

214
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,780
this dystopian society isn't the result 
of paranoia or crisis management,

215
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,450
but of scientific progress.
So what do you guys think is freewill,

216
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,353
all that great or even real,
or would we all be better off letting a 

217
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:27,000
super computer called the shots?
Personally,

218
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,550
I've over free will and letting 
computers only check email,

219
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,603
stay ahead,
brilliant dot or will help me train my 

220
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:35,400
brain through curated sequences of fun 
arcade style questions in logic,

221
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:37,140
linear Algebra,
classical mechanics,

222
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,700
artificial neural networks,
and more.

223
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,683
These modules test critical thinking and
analysis skills that could apply to the 

224
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:42,954
real world.
And if you want to learn more about our 

225
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,054
future overlords,
I'd recommend their module all machine 

226
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:50,340
learning which breaks down how 
supercomputer succeed in analyzing data.

227
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:53,310
We're humans fall short,
so develop your critical thinking and go
