00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,880
Hey guys,
three dimensional jared here.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,923
The first three seasons of bojack showed
us a protagonist that despite his 

5
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,480
Hollywood success,
struggled to find meaning.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,633
Buck season three ended with hope bojack
runs away from La and stairs that or 

7
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,480
heard of galloping horses,
potentially embracing the idea that he's

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,323
free to choose who he wants to be,
which brings us to the core of the new 

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,183
season.
Our ability to define and redefine our 

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,914
own narratives,
woken lists very late wisecrack quick 

11
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:40,230
take on bojack horseman season four,
and as always,

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,333
spoilers ahead.
Wrapped up in this season is what I'm 

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:44,364
going to call the narrative self,
that how we experience things and 

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,444
remember things are intricately wrapped 
up in the stories we tell about 

15
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,510
ourselves.
As philosopher Michael Geza,

16
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,040
Niga says,
we're natural storytellers.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,430
After the brain computes and event the 
illusory we,

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,100
that is the mind,
becomes aware of it.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,143
In other words,
the way we think and understand the 

20
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,560
world and ourselves is literally through
stories,

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,723
series creator.
Raphael Bob Waxford has spoken about 

22
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:11,784
this idea of self narrative and bojack 
because of the narrative we've 

23
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,100
experienced,
we've kind of internalize this idea that

24
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:17,934
we're working towards some great ending 
and that if we put all our ducks in a 

25
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,940
row will be rewarded and everything will
finally make sense.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,670
It's a struggle and we're all trying to 
figure it out,

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,520
and these characters are trying to 
figure it out for themselves.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,593
This struggle to redefine one's own 
narrative is integrally bound up with 

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,283
each character's happiness.
Everyone moves closer towards happiness 

30
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:37,974
as they move further away from the past.
Escaping the death of Sarah Lynn bojack 

31
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,300
drives to his family summer home and 
tries to redefine his own narrative that

32
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,134
he's a person who tries to be a handyman
but can't fix anything before later 

33
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:53,220
recasting himself as a tragic hero who's
bojack horseman,

34
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,210
who's bojack Horseman.

35
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,930
He's a very famous TV and film star,
or he was,

36
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,203
yeah,
before he gave it all up for a life of 

37
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,554
quiet anonymity.
Instead of making any real inroads into 

38
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,614
redefining his own character,
bojack ends up reliving the past that 

39
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,974
justifies his own self-loathing.
All the wildest show overlap the 

40
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,990
narrative of his mother's abusive 
childhood.

41
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,930
A cycle continued as she raised bojack.
Well,

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,773
Jack's life turns around when he 
befriends a dragon fly named Eddie who 

43
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,620
refuses to fly following his wife's 
debt,

44
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,583
but after Eddie tries to kill them both 
bojack season Eddie's fixation on the 

45
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,454
past as a cautionary tale about what 
grounding your narrative and a longing 

46
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:33,420
for the past can do.
So the next day in typical bojack style,

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,510
he hires a wrecking crew to level the 
sugarman house.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,470
Uh,
yeah.

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,050
You think I just want to mope around in 
a shrine to the past,

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,913
getting off of my own guilt while the 
rest of my life passes me by authentic 

51
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,544
much Princess Carolyn struggles to 
redefine the family narrative that she 

52
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,890
can do it all on her own as she tries to
get pregnant.

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,490
I don't need other options.
My mother had 12 kids.

54
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:56,260
My body was made for this.
We just got to keep tip.

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,133
There's even a whole episode framed as a
presentation by Princess Carolyn's 

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,190
future descendant.
That is actually just a story.

57
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:06,010
Princess Carolyn tells herself to cope 
with the president.

58
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,143
She used her current hardships as what 
philosopher war freeman called Frodo 

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,790
narrative,
or a story yet to happen.

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,073
It's the ending.
What happens next that gives these 

61
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,310
moments meaning,
for example,

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,353
say,
did you ever hear the story of the 

63
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:23,850
couple have moved to California?
I can't say,

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,090
oh,
it's a marvelous adventure.

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,860
You see,
they hardly knew each other,

66
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,950
but they shared a certain sensitivity at
a tastes for the unknown.

67
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:31,963
They were living in a one horse town,
so they headed west towards a town that 

68
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:37,100
could accommodate three horses.
Oh yes.

69
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:39,200
I think I have heard this story.

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,470
I got a small house in San Francisco 
near the bookstore,

71
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,720
except she doesn't know what happens 
next,

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,643
so in order to cling to the old 
narrative that she'll be fine and 

73
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,180
fertile,
she invents her own ending,

74
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,183
and when I think about that,
I think about how everything's going to 

75
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:54,584
work out because how else could you tell
people what the show tells us that this 

76
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:02,030
narrative is misguided as symbolized by 
her cherished family necklace that turns

77
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:05,030
out to be nothing more than worthless 
costume jewelry.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,580
Season four offers a solution to these 
ailments.

79
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,970
In what Michael White and David Epston 
called narrative therapy.

80
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,013
The point is to help patients re author 
their identity by focusing on what they 

81
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:18,680
value and then creating a narrative that
will help them pursue those values.

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,693
Nowhere is this more apparent than in 
bojack must learn to overcome the 

83
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:26,090
narrative that he's a terrible person,
especially in regards to Holly Hawk.

84
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,043
I don't want to,
but every time she looks at me with 

85
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:29,504
those big innocent eyes,
all I can think about is every thing 

86
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,700
I've ever done and I think I don't 
deserve that kind of love.

87
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,920
We actually get to hear bojack self 
narrative through his inner monologue,

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,113
your real stupid pieces,
but I know I'm a piece of that at least 

89
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,080
makes me better than all the pieces of 
who don't know are pieces of it.

90
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,320
Making things worse.
Bojack's forced to live with his abusive

91
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,280
mother,
Beatrice,

92
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,310
even though bojack's no longer living in
a shrine to the past,

93
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,610
still logging for the love of a mother 
who doesn't recognize him.

94
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,220
When bojack inevitably does something 
bad,

95
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,143
it just viciously perpetuates this 
negative narrative starting the cycle 

96
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,100
all over again.
However,

97
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:04,934
bojack may have finally broken the cycle
when he owns up to his actions with 

98
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,713
hollyhock.
You are an amazing woman and after 

99
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,264
Beatrice Laces hollyhocks coffee with 
embedded means bojack lets it go rather 

100
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:18,380
than perpetuating this multigenerational
tale of abuse and revenge.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,633
When Beatrice finally recognizes Bojack,
he stops looking for validation that 

102
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,654
will fix the past.
He just sees her as she is a sickly old 

103
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:29,720
lady and in the least bojack moment of 
his life,

104
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,960
he's kind to her.
He don't understand.

105
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,380
You're in Michigan,
Michigan.

106
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,700
Yeah.
At the lake house it.

107
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,860
It's a.
it's a warm summer night in.

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,083
The fireflies are dancing in the sky and
your whole family is here and they're 

109
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,010
telling you that everything is going to 
be all right.

110
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,003
In a final act of selflessness,
he lets hollyhocks eight dad's tell her 

111
00:05:59,121 --> 00:05:59,954
that bojack is actually her brother 
instead of claiming the good deed for 

112
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,100
himself,
but as a reward,

113
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,010
bojack gains something else.
I told you from the beginning,

114
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,560
I have eight dad's.
Yeah,

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,450
good,
but I've never had a brother.

116
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,280
Meanwhile,
Princess Carolyn tells us the stories we

117
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,500
tell ourselves aren't always real.

118
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,540
I got into this business because I love 
stories.

119
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,090
They comfort us,
they inspire us,

120
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,240
they create a context for how we 
experience the world,

121
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,440
but also you have to be careful because 
if you spend a lot of time with stories,

122
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,440
you start to believe that life is just 
stories and it's not.

123
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,020
Life is life,

124
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,983
so what do you think wise crack.
Can people really change themselves by 

125
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:44,764
changing their own narratives?
Let us know what you think in the 

126
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:47,464
comments section,
just as bojack is reshaping what an 

127
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:54,280
animated Sitcom can be.
Intel is doing the same for storytelling

128
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,114
in virtual reality,
dedicated to content and technology 

129
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:01,060
innovation,
Intel behind the vr film Pale blue dot,

130
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,320
allowing audiences to explore their way 
through deep space where earth is just a

131
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:06,154
speck in the cosmos,
inspired by the iconic Pale blue dot 

132
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:10,204
photograph.
The film brings other worlds to life 

133
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,690
with visual effects,
sound design,

134
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:14,524
and an original score under the 
direction of indie filmmaker Eliza 

135
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:18,484
mcnitt.
The film is part of Intel's commitment 

136
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,230
to empower vr filmmakers,
which is pretty cool.

137
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,453
While the film premieres in early 2018,
the first episode of the making of Pale 

138
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:28,594
blue dot,
the behind the scenes mini series is 

139
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:31,480
live now.

140
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,373
The series offers key snapshots of 
McKnight's journey with her fellow 

141
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,490
filmmakers.
In this new media,

142
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,653
we get to follow the team as they tackle
new challenges like what it means to 

143
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:44,260
tell a story when audiences have 
meaningful control of the experience and

144
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:47,020
why is crack.
We've consistently seen great filmmaking

145
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:47,854
come through,
learning to think on your feet and 

146
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:49,894
adapt.
It's cool to see those same principles 

147
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:55,900
applied to Vr and on this scale.
Watch the first episode on the making of
