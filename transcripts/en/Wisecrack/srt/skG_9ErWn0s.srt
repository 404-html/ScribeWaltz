1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,520
What

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,353
homie?
I got something special for my well 

3
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:15,350
wrapped dollars today.
I'm about to lay on your.

4
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:18,410
The first episode.
I'm my new audio series.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,150
Thug nodes get lit.
What are your boys?

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,283
You're going to keep doing this thing 
bringing bad as literature to the 

7
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:28,040
streets.
There's Tom Food Airways,

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,800
odd waves,
whatever the hell it's called.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,843
This show is live now,
so check it out on apple podcasts or 

10
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:36,224
your favorite podcast app,
but to give you guys a little taste of 

11
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:39,794
what's to come.
I'm going to draw some hits from the 

12
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:44,540
first episode right here,
right now.

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,260
Three examples of more money,
more problems in lit.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,590
Have you thought Biggie had it hard?
You won't believe this.

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,990
These characters went through when they 
started rolling in the benjamins.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,043
Number three,
Lou Ella Moss from no country for old 

17
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,374
men by Kar.
Mack McCarthy is 1980 and Lou Ella Moss 

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
hunting in a Texas desert when he 
stumbles upon a Satchel full of seed 

19
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:13,221
notes at a drug deal that went south 
dude's and instant seven figure ball up.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,073
Unfortunately,
that money puts him in the cross hairs 

21
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,074
of anti sugar,
a savage coin flipping hitman hide to 

22
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:25,040
retrieve the stolen loot,
and this dude don't play.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,920
It'd be saying you did.
You did.

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,670
After sneaking back into the badlands to
help out a dying man,

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,130
things go from bad to worse.
Lou Allen,

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,173
he's chased across the desert,
nearly eyes and sent to the hospital 

27
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,014
after I shoot out what the seemingly 
unkillable Shugart man I'm telling you 

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,233
that dog and time is after Harris,
the guy threatened to put one in his 

29
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:49,454
wife's,
don't bust his ass to meet her in El 

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,233
Paso.
Unfortunately some Mexican hitman smoke 

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,973
Llewellyn and leave his wife completely 
on her own against the gun and that boy 

32
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,464
heads on straight up waste this earth 
just for being a third wheel and all 

33
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:04,634
this damn that's cold blooded.
Lou Ella's life with stripe this moment 

34
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:10,544
he brought home that chatter,
but then didn't really some say his 

35
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:18,390
decision to help that die man back in 
the desert is what ultimately can man.

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,753
Maybe this is a sign of Hulu.
Well and truly is a good person who's 

37
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:27,890
just not cut out for that third life,
or maybe it's a warning that there ain't

38
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,690
no stopping depth.
Anyone,

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,110
not even for decent folks like Lulu 
Island and Mrs Moss.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,950
If the cartels didn't,
capital Shugar shows,

41
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:39,020
seeing the terminus,
the double to dust them both.

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,973
Hulu,
I would have skipped town with all the 

43
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,660
monies I was there.
No escaping this showdown with death.

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,920
Either way,
Lou,

45
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:49,160
I would try to get out of dodge with all
the muscle is bankroll.

46
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,580
Combine them and have that Kinda cash dr
the book.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,593
Then we're all know,
but Jay Gatsby from the great gatsby by 

48
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,143
f Scott Fitzgerald,
a Nick carraway lands a job in New York 

49
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,520
City during the twenties.
He rents a shack next to the swag bag of

50
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,354
Jay Gatsby,
a mysterious playboy who throws dope as 

51
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,430
parties but never joins them.

52
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,603
It turns out gas be hosts.
These rages in the hopes of attracting 

53
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,850
is back when honey dip.
Daisy Faye,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,833
who lives across the bay from Gatsby's 
crib with their douchey old money 

55
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:27,090
husband Tom Buchanan.
After being blue ball for years,

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,710
Jay and daisy finally started hooking 
up.

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,753
Unfortunately they do a good job at 
keeping it away from daisy's hobby who 

58
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,350
gets his revenge by telling her how 
gatsby made all his bucks.

59
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,090
Bootlegging.
Yeah,

60
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,720
that boy gatsby a hospital man and 
another twist face.

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,910
He decides to stick it out with her dead
beat.

62
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,810
Husband girl just can't handle the thug 
life at Gatsby side.

63
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,390
I thought she was a ride or die chick.
Daisy.

64
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,943
I'm disappointed.
It looks like they couldn't be worse 

65
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:56,934
with team gatsby until holy time side 
bitch gets run over by daisy and the 

66
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,410
girl husband fades.
Gatsby was behind the wheel.

67
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,690
That dead chick's crazy as hubby.

68
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,070
Hands down to gatsby's mansion and 
glasses him in his swimming pool.

69
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,083
It's game over for the great gatsby.
Why did things go south for great 

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,793
gatsby?
Maybe it was because his whole approach 

71
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,374
to life will straight up whack.
Rather thought he can buy his way back 

72
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,450
to happiness.
Well,

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,293
the gangster wide,
but daisy ain't one of his pants and 

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,633
shirts that a human and the human heart 
and the kind of thing you can buy on 

75
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,260
Amazon.
You got to go on the black market,

76
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,094
but that kind of crazy becoming rich 
didn't make me any happier than being 

77
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,310
rich did for daisy.
I mean,

78
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,144
just look at her.
She's a top shelf social light on a 

79
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,620
surface,
but her heart is busted.

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,633
Her marriage sucks,
and she's shallow as even nick thought 

81
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,390
Gatsby's Corny as view of daisy being 
all perfect wasn't jiving with reality.

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,630
The character was capable of achieving 
their happiness they really wanted,

83
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,643
which might be why so many people 
compare the great gatsby to the failure 

84
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,210
of the American dream.

85
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,400
What is the American dream?
Well,

86
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,234
it depends on who you ask,
but it boils down to busting your ass 

87
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,253
too.
You get enough bread to buy whatever 

88
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:16,354
makes you happy.
Does the American dream holed up in 

89
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:19,380
practice?
Well,

90
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:22,840
in the Great Gatsby,
the verdict is Hell No.

91
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,973
All the American dream got Jay Gatsby 
was a death sentence for vehicular 

92
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,050
homicide.
Gee,

93
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,240
thanks for driving,
Miss Daisy.

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,710
Number one,
Bilbo Baggins,

95
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,773
the Hobbit by j Dot r dot tolkien.
Bilbo baggins is a fat ass hobbit who 

96
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,784
likes to eat,
glaze up and do Jack to one day some 

97
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,103
nappy wizard crashed his crib with a 
team of dwarves and invited him to 

98
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:51,820
retake the lonely mountain and all this 
prejudice from the dragon smile.

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,690
Damn.
That must've been some Danville.

100
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:58,730
Va was cheap and after major grubbing 
billable,

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,630
joins the gang on a fantastic journey.
Pack with stranger things.

102
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,180
Then we seen on stranger things,
we're talking problems.

103
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,303
Trolls,
a magic ring that Bilbo pockets and an 

104
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:13,730
enormous dragon tiller.
Top amount of blame.

105
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,990
Smile gets it correct and the doors 
reclaimed their mouth.

106
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,143
The fastest thing you can say,
my precious five armies hustle over and 

107
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,774
start scrapping over the recovered loop.
This results in the climactic battle of 

108
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,670
the five arms.
Luckily though bill on ducks,

109
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,100
the dramas of Bob's the little shoddy 
pieces out,

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,740
what only a small percentage is prize 
money,

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,320
but it's all good.
He hurries home as fast as it's bad.

112
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:42,680
Last can carry them because you know 
what?

113
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,860
That money's going up in smoke.
Y'All.

114
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,570
If you wonder why Bilbo didn't help 
himself to more of the recovery swag,

115
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,613
it might be because so much of the crazy
in the hobbit goes down because of good 

116
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:56,954
old fashioned greed.
Consider the dwarves and session to 

117
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,910
reclaim the mountain.
Something Thorn.

118
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:02,744
Oh,
concealed leader of the dwarves 

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,720
regretted as he lay dying.

120
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,170
If more of US valued food,
cheer and song above,

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,420
hoarded cold,
he says the bill Bilbo.

122
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,463
It wouldn't be a merrier world.
Just about everyone in the hobbit got 

123
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,844
their minds on the treasure,
which might explain why talking chose 

124
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,120
Bilbo is his main character.
As a Hobbit,

125
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,300
there's a childlike innocence to him 
living a simple life.

126
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I like the dragons doors and who all 
about the money and the power was turned

127
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:33,554
off by greed.
That's probably tokens killed that we 

128
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,360
should as well.
That's it.

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,630
Google does things up the middle earth 
by swiping out.

130
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:44,060
One ring from the Creta Gollum.
What's this?

131
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,770
Greed.
I wasn't talking.

132
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:48,710
Setting up his future books.
What's the difference?

133
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,460
Because you know someone was seeing 
dollar signs with that move.

134
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,760
Shout out to Pete Jackson,
three hobbit movies for,

135
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,493
and that's all the goods I got today.
