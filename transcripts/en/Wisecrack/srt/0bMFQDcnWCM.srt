1
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,510
Well,
I have an Internet addiction,

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,723
a really,
really bad bad form of Internet 

3
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,530
addiction where I,
you know,

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,680
I have spent a full eight hour days on 
the Internet.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,770
It's a point where I'm like,
I should just become like a one of those

6
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:33,750
employed bloggers or something because I
can't stop an average day.

7
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,360
I'll probably be on the Internet for 
about four hours.

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,303
Um,
I have 12 to 15 blogs I might read 

9
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,660
regularly and then I have to go through 
all my new sites,

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,880
conventional news sites,
alternative news sites,

11
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,380
you know,
compare and contrast,

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,493
um,
know exactly what's going on in the 

13
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,140
world several times a day.
Um,

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,603
so,
but,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,751
you know,
for me,

16
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,584
the Internet on the upside of it,
sort of an endless source of 

17
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:59,650
inspiration.
Um,

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,613
there's no excuse anymore.
I think for writers block really when 

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,590
you could go hit up number of eccentric 
blogs on topics from,

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,010
um,
you know,

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,853
you could read the blog of pro anorexic 
women or you could read the blog of 

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,750
soldiers in Iraq.

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,330
Um,
and in here,

24
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:28,170
those and in blogging offers this sort 
of,

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,033
um,
I think very genuine first person a 

26
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:38,370
universe that's,
that's endlessly fascinating to me.

27
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,204
I mean that,
that when you can find those blogs that 

28
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,550
sort of feel like diaries,
so refreshing and,

29
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,384
uh,
there's always some kernel in those for 

30
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,830
me to get very inspired by.
Um,

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,880
so I generally get way too many ideas 
from the news and blogs.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,130
Um,
and I,

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,420
and I sometimes encourage my students to
do the same.

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,780
Um,
all those hours that you're fiddling and

35
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,370
doing,
God knows what on the Internet,

36
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,573
um,
you can justify it and say you're 

37
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,821
actually creating some form of art in a 
sneaky.
