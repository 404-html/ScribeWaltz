roller cat named Ms.

00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,893
Later the woodhouse fam throw a banging 
party when Emma started conversating 

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,650
with a sweet little girl named Harriet 
Smith.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,130
Now Harry and ain't exactly packing man 
brains.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,173
So Emma decide she's going to coach her 
to live the high life like she do while 

16
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:06,790
she kicking it with Emma Harry and peep 
game at the son of a family of farmers.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,720
Robert Martin and her panties 
immediately hit the flow.

18
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,520
Damn,

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,593
But Emma like,
oh you don't want to mess or no scrub 

20
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,070
ass.
Fama girl Emma,

21
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:18,904
thanks.
She got to hook her up with a real 

22
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:22,210
playboy like Elton.
So Emma,

23
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:25,780
get her Cuban on in veins looking good 
between area in and out.

24
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,300
But when weren't calm that Robert Martin
want to get with Marriott.

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,220
Emma like Ah,

26
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,054
whole life girl.
When nightly recognize that imma tell 

27
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:39,040
hair.
Are you the dog Robert Martin?

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,993
Well he like girl.
You must have lost your mind if you 

29
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:46,090
think Elton care about Harriet.
He only cares about rich bitches.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,430
I mean women.
Matter of fact,

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,353
MSL blind,
she don't even recognize that Elton 

32
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,144
might be Jonesing for her ass.
One Night Alan start throwing game at 

33
00:01:56,021 --> 00:02:00,760
Emma and she all like hold up.
I thought it was hairy it on a rag,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,833
but he like,
oh that bitch only talked to her cause 

35
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:08,110
she tells you what to do and metallic 
boy Harry,

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,253
it all told about l not one hers,
but she beats through the pain and head 

37
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,970
off to visit some homies called the 
basises.

38
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,520
Turns out there's a new gal on the 
block.

39
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,400
The bates is his knees,
Jane Fairfax.

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,530
Now Jane is foxy smart ag of buster sick
flow on the piano forte.

41
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,663
Emma is used to being the bad bitch bits
on the block so she getting all turned 

42
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:31,894
that everybody digging Jane's game 
instead of hires specially says Jane 

43
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:36,784
ain't got the facts.
Fact facts are the rap sheet got so Mr 

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,553
Western son Frank Churchill drop in and 
start chopping it up with him or I did 

45
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,413
some good laughs.
Frank got a bounce cause it's id sick 

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,460
but from the lungs of it rather than 
might be getting suite on Emma.

47
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,640
Emma like Nah he probably better for 
Harry.

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,803
Meanwhile Mr.
Allen ended up getting heads to some 

49
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,690
rich hot seat that k nobody staying 
later.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,830
Frank come back to town but Emma puts 
his ass in the friend zone.

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,693
They decided to hit the club anyway and 
what Harry Rolling Solo on the dance 

52
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:15,250
floor nightly step up this dog freaking 
on it a few days later.

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,480
Harrier says she's moved on from Allen 
the song one way flight.

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,460
Emma.
Thank it's that cat frank,

55
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,443

getting mad dog by crew of Gypsies 

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,990
couple of days ago.
Thank goodness over the next two days.

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,530
Frank Star,
dirty Mac and Emma in front of the whole

58
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,420
hood.
Damn Frank.

59
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,100
That ain't nice dog nightly.
Say he going to skip town for a few days

60
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,023
but before he leaves he looked like he 
about the kids in Emma's hand but he 

61
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,104
pulled out at the last second.
I know that move Emma still gig that he 

62
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,431
thought about it though next day phrase 
and it takes that long dirt now some now

63
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,620
amma thinking he could stop the bus and 
get what?

64
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:01,621
Harriet but then break Yo south.
Emma get worried that Jane and Frank got

65
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,790
engaged on the loud.
Loud.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,450
What?
What about Harry,

67
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,990
you and this Gibran Brawny been smooth 
talking me.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Why thieves in gaze?
Aw Hell Nah.

69
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,040
When news come to Harriet,
she all like girl,

70
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,290
I ain't in the bitch ass.
Chomps like frank.

71
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,124
Anyway,
I got this other dude I don't like hold 

72
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:22,984
up girl.
You're talking about nightly damn 

73
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:25,654
straight.
I'm going to start bugging hard cause 

74
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:28,444
she started realizing that she want to 
be when nightly now emma thinking she 

75
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,270
should have never taken area out of the 
hood.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,313
So nightly come by.
Emma thinking he probably Gone Jab on 

77
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:43,440
about Harry his booty but surprise bitch
nightly say he loved Mary.

78
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,650
Emma like that girl,
you're lost her goddamn mine.

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Nightly proposes and Emma saying Hell 
Yeah player put a ring on it.

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,133
I mean yeah this one,
this one and my son Harry and a lot of 

81
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,024
sand,
sorry girl nightly his mom man now but 

82
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,534
later she find out Harry,
you're going to marry that farmer boy 

83
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,880
and Robert Martin.
Anyway so she ended up getting her freak

84
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:10,630
nasty on tilt.
So both couples getting married and it's

85
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,010
all good in the hood,

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,390
like all fresh jams laid down.
But my girl Jane Austin,

87
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,220
this tax got an ass load to say about 
women and society back in the day.

88
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,630
Emma's a choice example of what an 
empowered woman or the time looks like.

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,350
Whereas most gals had to rely on men.
Fair thing.

90
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,273
Emma don't need nothing from nobody.
She got the money and the power to 

91
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,750
control her own life,
both in the crib and in the hood.

92
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,340
Sound's all good,
right?

93
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,370
Set that control ain't all it's cracked 
up to be.

94
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,293
Matter of fact,
it just turns her into a miserable 

95
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,654
haven.
The real evils indeed of Emma situation 

96
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,104
where the power of having rather too 
much her own way and the disposition to 

97
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,554
think a little too allover itself.
These were the disadvantages which 

98
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,440
threatened to Lloyd's or her many 
enjoyments.

99
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,483
The danger however was that presence so 
on proceed that they did not by any 

100
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:11,240
means grandkids misfortunes with her.

101
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,600
Funny thing is Miley always telling him 
what that is,

102
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,434
the duty of fat cats to look out for the
pope folk since they the leaders of the 

103
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,470
hood,
but like my girl Jane Austin,

104
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,304
do she just slang an irony up in here,
cause money show is held on make people 

105
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,804
act right towards anybody.
Now check I that fuck boy out and sugar 

106
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,004
mama.
She just came up in the game and got 

107
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:33,614
paid but still be acting like a fool.
Always acting nasty and saying stupid 

108
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,864
shit in front of everybody.
That new money show didn't give her no 

109
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:44,120
class,
but even without slow pockets,

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,510
people still acting out.
Elton thank he can get with Emma,

111
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,493
but say Harry,
you're too much of a hood rat and 

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,340
married,
so it's good for him or the slum it with

113
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,330
you,
but you too.

114
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,030
Good for Harriet.
Fuck that player.

115
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,150
Truth is Austin Hayden or anyone who 
obsessed with rank or status,

116
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,203
no matter what your money looked like,
but she throw the most Ceda Emma who 

117
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:06,454
spent her time thinking that people got 
to stay in that place and anybody who 

118
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,010
tried to better themselves,
it's just clowning.

119
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,620
Just check out what she's saying.
When Elton tried to put a ring on it,

120
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,200
he must know that unfortunate 
consequence.

121
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,034
She was greatly his superior.
He must know that the one houses had 

122
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:24,560
been sat up for several generations at 
Hartfield.

123
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,483
The younger brands have a very ancient 
family and that the alums were nobody 

124
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,650
for Emma,
such a hater.

125
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,530
How can they read a tolerate her stank 
ass?

126
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,543
Well,
that's when my girl Jane austen's pro 

127
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:36,644
writing skills come into play.
She slanging this technique called free 

128
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,050
indirect discourse.
Basically,

129
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,810
the narration is highly close to Emma's 
thoughts,

130
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,960
but it also includes some outside 
commentary,

131
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,973
Latin,
a step back from her wack ass 

132
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:54,530
perspective so the audience can follow 
her motivations but not how to deal with

133
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,520
the shallow bulls.

134
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,160
I put her down,
you feel me?

135
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,150
Thank goodness though Austin don't use 
free and direct discourse.

136
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,100
What the more righteous characters like 
Miss Westin and nightly since miss w and

137
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:07,934
k money too legit to quit.
Austin just let their words speak for 

138
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:14,390
themselves.
This is only one emma learn that Harriet

139
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:19,040
is going to marry the farmer boy that 
she recognize all this social status job

140
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,993
don't mean nothing.
You can get rich like Mrs Elton and 

141
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:23,504
still act like a chump are.
You can be a low level hustling like 

142
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,134
Robert Martin and still be classy.
Even if you got humble beginnings like 

143
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,920
Mr Weston High Society going to treat 
you right.

144
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,460
If you act real,
if you show respect,

145
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,403
you're going to get respect straight up.
It don't matter if you got cash or 

146
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:43,250
streets certified status,
it's all how you act.

147
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,900
That's going to get you where you going.
