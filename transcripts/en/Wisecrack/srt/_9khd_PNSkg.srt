1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,430
So there's two general hypotheses or 
theories about the nature of time.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,590
One of them will call presentism and 
present him presentism.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,790
The notion is is that only the present 
is real,

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,030
the past was real.
The future,

5
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:22,910
some configuration of the future 
universe will be real.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,230
But for now only the president Israel in
contrast,

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,530
the posing view is called eternalism 
internal wisdom.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,400
We you have the past,
present and future are all equally meal.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,473
So that makes the present just an 
arbitrary point in time or an arbitrary 

10
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:44,240
moment in time.
So one way to think about this is now is

11
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:49,241
to time as here is to space.
So in the same sense that I happen to be

12
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,294
here and some viewers are out at some 
other point in space and we're all 

13
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,704
comfortable with that notion that other 
points in space are equally real and 

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,380
eternal wisdom.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,213
You have to be comfortable with the 
notion that other moments in time or as 

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,110
equally real as this moment in time,
and this is just an arbitrary moment.

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,243
So under that view,
there are other moments or that there's 

18
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:11,444
a continuum of moments in time that are 
essentially already laid out within the 

19
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:20,510
universe and that universe in physics 
called the block universe.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,613
So under the block universe,
it makes sense to engage in a 

21
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:29,201
conversation about time travel because 
there's other moments to go to.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,133
Not that this doesn't speak to the issue
of whether the time travel is actually 

23
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,190
applause,
plausible or not,

24
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,024
it's probably not.
But it enables the conversation because 

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,213
other moments in time exists now under 
presentism we can pretty much take the 

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,823
possibility of time travel off the table
because there's no other moments to go 

27
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,480
to.
Only the president is real.

28
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,343
So it doesn't make sense to ask if you 
can travel to moments in time in the 

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,370
past or future that don't exist.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Now there's a clash here between 
neuroscience and physics.

31
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,390
So intuitively the time,
time seems to be changing.

32
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:15,140
We humans experience the flow of time.
Um,

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,093
under eternal ISM.
It's where everything is already laid 

34
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,054
out.
The flow of time is a deep mystery 

35
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:22,904
because it would seem to be that if all 
of moments in time are already laid out 

36
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:32,440
within the block universe,
that the flow of time shouldn't exist or

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,130
must be an illusion.
So if the flow of time,

38
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:40,460
if our subjective sense of the flow of 
time is an illusion,

39
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,670
we have this clash between physics and 
neuroscience because the dominant theory

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,313
in physics is that we live in the block 
universe and there's buy nice should be 

41
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,020
clear.
There's no consensus,

42
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,883
there's no a hundred percent agreement.
But the standard view in physics is 

43
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:58,694
that,
and this comes large part from 

44
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:05,161
relativity that um,
we live in an eternal student universe.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,330
I'm in the block universe in which the 
past,

46
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,164
present future is equally meal.
So this raises the question of whether 

47
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:16,990
we can trust our brain to tell us that 
time is flowing.

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,153
So I think we need to have a improved 
dialogue between physics and 

49
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,034
neuroscience here.
So on one hand we have to decide is if 

50
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,024
we want to accept that are subjective 
sense of the flow of time is an 

51
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,630
objective fact about the universe.
We perceive time to be flowing.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Things seem to be changing.
The past seems to be,

53
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,020
um,
vaporizing into,

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,840
into the past.
And the future seems to be wide open.

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,453
Now,
if it's the case that we live in the 

56
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:55,741
block universe,
that seems to be illusory in a very deep

57
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:56,794
sense.
So we have to decide if we want to take 

58
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,270
our subjective sense of the flow of time
as an objective fact about the universe.

59
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,473
Um,
that must be explained by physics or in 

60
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,420
contrast is,
um,

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,450
our subjective sense of the flow of 
time.

62
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,780
Merely an illusion,
an illusion in the deepest sense of that

63
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,614
word,
because we're perceiving something that 

64
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,414
doesn't exist in the physical world,
that physics doesn't need to explain 

65
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,240
because it doesn't exist.
And thus,

66
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,074
neuroscience needs to address where the 
solution comes from and the solution is 

67
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:33,680
presumably tightly,
um,

68
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,550
coupled with the problem of 
consciousness.

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,993
Mm.
