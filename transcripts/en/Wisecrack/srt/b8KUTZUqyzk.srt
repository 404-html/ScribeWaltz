1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,490
Hey guys,
jared again.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,280
Today we're talking about your favorite 
little town in Colorado.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,460
Yup.
South Park for the past three seasons.

4
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:11,294
The show's ditched at signature 
standalone episodes and embrace season 

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,270
long serialization and it's largely been
awesome.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,373
Season 19 brilliantly blended themes of 
pc culture advertising and 

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:22,874
gentrification over a multi episode arc.
And most recently season 20 kicked off 

8
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:30,860
with an even more ambitious storyline 
that juggled the presidential election,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,620
member berries,
a militant feminist Hartman,

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,610
a girl hating Dick flashing butters,
and a whole lot of internet trolling.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,060
It all seem to be leading up to some 
epic conclusion.

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,270
And then everything just fizzles out 
into confusion convolution and only they

13
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,234
just blew up the internet.
So why did season 20 leave us feeling 

14
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:50,894
all itchy and uncertain like a fourth 
grade school wide outbreak of Lice had 

15
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,340
just surface?
Well,

16
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,174
we have an idea and it all has to do 
with Matt and trey secret sauce that 

17
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:01,400
makes South Park's writing.
So good.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,890
Welcome to this wisecrack condition on 
South Park.

19
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,650
Season 20 what went wrong?
And as always,

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,573
spoilers ahead.
Watching south park feels like peering 

21
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,620
inside the mind of the world's funniest 
stoner.

22
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,780
It's unpredictable,
imaginative,

23
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:18,080
and completely unhinged in the best way 
possible.

24
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,860
But make no mistake,
there's a strict order to the madness.

25
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,950
The show is constructed with one rigid 
plotline rule.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,033
We found out this really simple rule 
that maybe you guys have all heard 

27
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,180
before.
We can take these beats,

28
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:35,181
which are basically the beats of your 
outline and if the words and then belong

29
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,170
between those beats,
you're

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,543
for instance,
here's a three plot storyline about 

31
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:40,854
stick figure.
John John Adopts a stray dog and then 

32
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:46,200
John wins the lottery and then John 
becomes a scientologists.

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,730
John's story has a sucky narrative 
because there is no cause and effect.

34
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,623
You could rearrange each action into any
order and it would remain a random 

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,900
series of events in the life of a 
lottery winning dog,

36
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:58,734
rescuing intro level scientologists.
So what makes good southpark approved 

37
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:05,150
writing and whenever you can replace 
your andwith,

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,470
buts or therefores,
it makes for better,

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,453
right?
Take South Park's famous Mormon episode 

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,440
and annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves 
to town.

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,060
Therefore heat pisses everyone off.
Therefore stand decides to kick his ass,

42
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,820
but the kid is so nice that he tell 
standing,

43
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,770
go ahead and beat him up.
Therefore,

44
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,604
Stan doesn't beat him up and said he 
agrees to go to the kid's house for 

45
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,174
dinner.
Notice how each action that begins with 

46
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:33,570
therefore or but indicates a consequence
or reaction to the previous action.

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,613
Every pot point matters,
which is why the show never loses 

48
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:38,100
momentum.
Okay,

49
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:38,934
so that's south park's golden rule,
but before we dive into what went wrong 

50
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:45,720
with season 20 it's time to talk about 
the orange tinted elephant in the room.

51
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,690
Yup.
The president of the United States stone

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,010
in Parker had been upfront about the 
fact that like 99% of the pollsters,

53
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,060
they expected Turd Sandwich to win the 
election and plan the series around that

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,923
outcome.
They had to do desperate minute read 

55
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,040
rights in order to Aaron episode the day
after the election,

56
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,130
so not ideal.
As soon as giant Douche,

57
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,870
Mr.
Garrison wins the election,

58
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,733
the show starts breaking the creator's 
core rules and getting them all put Dab 

59
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,350
as seen in the two main plotlines member
berries and trolling.

60
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,363
Let's map out the member berries.
Plotline randy tries member barry's 

61
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,500
false into eight and install jic 
transcend things.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,330
Get a little dark room.
I ran excel model not full times.

63
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,203
Therefore,
Randy realizes member berries are 

64
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,730
dangerous,
brainwashing germs with the what's going

65
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,620
on with these member berries.
Meanwhile,

66
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,540
Mr.
Garrison along with his vp,

67
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,374
Caitlyn Jenner is leading in the polls,
but he realizes he doesn't have a plan 

68
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,910
to carry out his campaign promises and 
we'll look like a jackass if he wins.

69
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,250
What the hell do I do?
If I win,

70
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,830
I won't be able to do what I promised.
Therefore,

71
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,693
Mr.
Garrison spends the first half of the 

72
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,930
series trying to sabotage his campaign 
so hillary will win.

73
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,020
I don't know what the I'm doing.
I've got to come clean.

74
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,420
I,
I had no idea I would get this far,

75
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,660
but the fact of the matter is I should 
not be president,

76
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,660
but his voters catch on and demand an 
explanation.

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Therefore,
Randy tells garrison the truth about his

78
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,390
popularity.

79
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,670
When the world is changing so fast,
it makes us yearn for the old ways.

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,713
When life seemed simpler,
but it doesn't mean those old ideas are 

81
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,610
good for us now.
Therefore,

82
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,980
the two of them set out to destroy 
member berries,

83
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,760
but quickly realized that these little 
guys just won't die.

84
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,863
Therefore,
randy convinces Mr Carish to give a 

85
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,504
heartfelt speech denouncing nostalgia on
November 8th you must vote against me 

86
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,110
and show the world that you didn't think
the new star wars was all that good.

87
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,140
And there you have it.
A perfect half season set up.

88
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:48,250
Ray Hilary victory that follows the 
golden rule of southpark storytelling.

89
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,930
Except newsflash,
hilary lost.

90
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,343
Suddenly they have to justify garrison 
surprising when and that's when things 

91
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,180
get messy.
Now,

92
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,014
south park has to improvise it's way 
through the rest of the season and the 

93
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,030
writers start to break their own 
storytelling rules.

94
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,150
We go from a strictly but or therefore 
based plot,

95
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,840
tweet,
big cluster of and bed starting with.

96
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,020
And then Mr.
Garrison winds anyway out of nowhere.

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,630
And then Kaitlin Barfs,
reinfecting,

98
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,940
Mr.
Garrison and randy with member berries.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,340
So Randy and garrison trip out on the 
stall.

100
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,174
Jah,
forget their quest to destroy member 

101
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:29,440
berries and generally get stoked on 
garrison's victory.

102
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,200
This presses the rewind button on the 
plot,

103
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,660
watching them unlearn the perils of the 
storage.

104
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:37,360
It is literally narrative back pedaling.
Also,

105
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,194
you have this nagging feeling that it 
should take more than a bit of Berry 

106
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,004
flavored nostalgia to explain garrison 
split second transformation from 

107
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,084
terrified self sabotaging presidential 
candidate to the cocky leader of the 

108
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:53,030
free world there today on there whose 
hair?

109
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,710
It's the president of the United States.
From here,

110
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,410
the member barry storyline just 
generally gets muddled.

111
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,453
At the beginning of the season,
they had a clear purpose to set up a 

112
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:04,424
physical embodiment of the toxic 
nostalgia that will eventually be 

113
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,040
overcome like the human adds in the 
earlier season.

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,113
They start out as lazy,
intoxicating berries and then they 

115
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,984
magically turned into a weird vomit 
inducing virus and then they stop by at 

116
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:23,360
1920s nightclub in a brief side story 
that seems quickly forgotten and then we

117
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,560
find out they're Nazis.

118
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,260
Mama Stan Jubril's not nurse to your 
base.

119
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,160
Real old lines people line a maybe that 
got our men being

120
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,133
also pals with Vladimir Putin and by the
end they're ultimately looking like a 

121
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,390
tiny fruit militia.
Ultimately,

122
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:43,900
the show doesn't offer any justification
for the member berries transformation.

123
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,853
Instead we get a random progression of 
events that build without any apparent 

124
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:51,220
logic and that's just not the south park
emo.

125
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,913
Now onto another sub plot that got 
tangled up by a trump win trolling for 

126
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:58,504
most of the season.
We watched Kyle's Dad Gerald living his 

127
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:01,414
best life as the wine.
Oh trolls skank hunt 42 this initially 

128
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,720
conforms with the South Park philosophy 
of story structure.

129
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,673
Gerald's trolling angers the Danes.
Therefore the Danes threatened to 

130
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:12,034
release everyone's Internet history,
sending Gerald Cartman South Park and 

131
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:15,844
the world into a panic.
Enter Hillary Clinton who's confidence 

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,433
she's about to win the presidency,
but she finds out trolled trace might 

133
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:22,894
leak her online activities.
Therefore she needs who is gang hunt 42 

134
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,280
we believe he's the only one who can 
save you then crap.

135
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,323
She loses the election and again,
the narrative structure starts to 

136
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,820
crumble without her presidency to 
defend.

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Clinton doesn't have any real reason to 
recruit Gerald's slash skank hunt 42 and

138
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:49,570
then confusingly Clinton recruits him 
anyway with a vague mission.

139
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,200
He needs to infiltrate troll trace to 
protect US secrets.

140
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,730
We want to send someone into Denmark 
undercover and steal their technology.

141
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,500
This entire scene of Hillary meeting 
Gerald below the bridge feel super weird

142
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,334
and disjointed,
almost like it's from an alternate 

143
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:05,824
reality.
That's because it probably was recycled 

144
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:08,644
material from the original.
If Hillary had one version of the 

145
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,824
episode,
it's certainly what fit the south park 

146
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,423
role of storytelling.
A newly elected hillary is afraid of 

147
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:19,150
having compromising emails released by 
troll trace.

148
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,043
Therefore,
she recruits Gerald to take down the 

149
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:22,384
dates.
Gerald wants to stop troll trace from 

150
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,500
revealing his secret identity anyway.
Therefore,

151
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:30,460
he agrees to go and delete the evidence 
and save both of them from exposure.

152
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,500
But in this strange new president 
garrison run world that can't fly.

153
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,350
So in a desperate attempt to salvage the
plotline,

154
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,213
the show reveals that Clinton's claim 
was merely a ruse and she's actually 

155
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:46,300
just helping the Danes kidnap American 
trolls in exchange for the protection of

156
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,010
her email.
And then oops,

157
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,013
turns out they're just trolling the 
American trolls they capture and then 

158
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:59,280
this top Danish guy wasn't trying to 
punish the trolls.

159
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,173
He's also just a giant troll trolling 
the world for the loans and also he's 

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,680
not even in Danish.
Did your brain just melt?

161
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,053
If so,
it's probably because South Park 

162
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,870
abandoned its most basic narrative 
premise.

163
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,793
None of the events in the trolling 
narrative actually build off previous 

164
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,480
actions.
They're just a seemingly random,

165
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,510
increasingly complicated laundry list of
plot points.

166
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,463
The show writers openly complained about
the narrative hold they dug for 

167
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:25,600
themselves.

168
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,370
Come on,
this is South Park.

169
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,750
What's happened?
You less?

170
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,800
We used to have a challenging deal with 
it.

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,953
They move onto the next one.
Now we've just been dealing with 

172
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,324
trolling of Internet stuff over and over
week after week and I don't know about 

173
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,080
you,
but I get pretty sick of it.

174
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,480
It almost feels like the Danish guys 
announcement that he's just trolling the

175
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,390
world is a last ditch effort to rescue 
the narrative.

176
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,080
Maybe this is like the new post funny 
era of satire.

177
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,033
Just like Mr.
Garrison when he's drunk on member 

178
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:51,164
berries,
a completely nihilistic troll doesn't 

179
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:54,710
need plot consistency.
From there,

180
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:57,650
the writers need to wrap up a few 
incompletes storylines,

181
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,513
most notably the risks cartman and 
Gerald face from having their internet 

182
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,050
history reveal so they commit plot Hari 
Cari,

183
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,800
by blowing everything up.
That's right.

184
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,663
Everybody from Kyle's little brother Ike
to the top generals at the Pentagon 

185
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,953
collaborate to take down the Internet 
with a massive blitz of trolling and a 

186
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,200
little help from Elon Musk space x 
program.

187
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,070
By blowing up the internet and deleting 
everybody's ugly a secrets,

188
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,963
they also destroy the cause and effect 
relationship that isn't building up all 

189
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:30,740
season instead of a satisfying 
conclusion where things get resolved,

190
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,780
audiences just get a big old psych.

191
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,940
We're blowing everything up.
Before that,

192
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:35,774
the season had done such a good job of 
analyzing the way the Internet has 

193
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,480
fragmented our public and private 
selves.

194
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,403
How this sense of privacy has given us 
all the ability to behave like assholes 

195
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,260
without the people we love ever having 
to find out.

196
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,920
This was all building up to a really 
promising conclusion,

197
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,933
but we never got it.
The show also brilliantly skewers the 

198
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,623
outrage cycles that dominate Internet 
culture as trolls expertly push our 

199
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:00,794
buttons.
This kind of simmering outrage actually 

200
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:05,750
seems like a more interesting 
explanation for Mr Garrison's victory.

201
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:06,584
Then member berries,
the show never develops this idea aside 

202
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,830
from giving it one quick shout out 
during the finale tribers axiom,

203
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,980
trevor's axiom is a well known equation 
in online trolling.

204
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,843
It's a way in which one person can 
create a massive reaction on the 

205
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:21,590
Internet all bringing up the worst in 
humanity.

206
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,163
That sort of sounds like how I got 
elected because Matt and Trey Thought 

207
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,534
Hillary would win.
They spent the first half of the season 

208
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,130
teasing the perils of having your 
internet history exposed,

209
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,023
but since trump won hillary's emails 
exposing her are no longer as relevant 

210
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:38,210
as say the outrage cycles on social 
media.

211
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,253
So what might season 20 of south park 
have looked like in a parallel universe 

212
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,560
where the Turd sandwich triumphs?
Haven't you seen the polls?

213
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,663
It's president elect senators or 
according to a deadline interview with 

214
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:50,234
stone and Parker viewers.
Got a sneak peek in the postelection 

215
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,613
episode.
Bill Clinton and bill cosby joined 

216
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:59,680
forces to announce their new South Park 
is gentleman's club and obvious hangover

217
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,514
from me if Hillary,
one version of the episode later Bill 

218
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,210
Confides in butters that the club was 
actually a place for men to hide because

219
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,350
trust me,
my wife is a crazy bitch.

220
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,173
She and all the other women in the world
are about to get payback and we are all 

221
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,660
completely,

222
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,673
Parker says that in the alternate 
reality season 20 they would have 

223
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:24,884
focused on bill settling into his new 
role as the apparently terrified first 

224
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:29,174
gentlemen of the u s it would have been 
a fitting way to escalate the battle of 

225
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:34,700
the sexes already underway at South Park
Elementary.

226
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,540
It also would have given a lot more 
pointing seat to Carmen's newly inspired

227
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,200
fear of his girlfriend Heidi,
who he suspects is trying to destroy him

228
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,213
instead.
The first gentleman's club is 

229
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,013
understandably abandoned.
So what does the future hold for South 

230
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,681
Park?
Well,

231
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:49,514
the creators warrant being subtle when 
they called the last episode of season 

232
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,440
20 the end of civilization as we know 
it,

233
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,810
if they're really leaving serialization 
behind,

234
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,080
let's kind of a bummer because as messy 
as season 20 was,

235
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,840
there was a lot of promise and in our 
humble opinion,

236
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,674
they did some of their best work at the 
decade in seasons 18 and 19 why let a 

237
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,700
silly election between a giant Douche in
a Turd Sandwich ruin all that?

238
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,893
So what did you guys think is he's in 20
let us know what you think in the 

239
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,530
comments.
Thanks for watching guys.

240
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,250
He thanks for watching wise crack.
If you can't get enough south park,

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,173
we're starting an all new South Park 
podcast next week called respect our 

242

243
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,830
