00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,783
Hey wisecrack jared again and today 
we're taking a look at the show that 

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:11,294
tears to ask the question,
how much body horror can we 

4
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:14,204
realistically animate in 22 minutes?
I'm talking about Netflix is devilishly 

5
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:18,554
good anime offering devil man cry baby.
While you may know it by its reputation 

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:22,934
as that show with lots of incredibly 
violent humping cartoon boobs and 

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,283
incredibly violent cartoon boobs.
Domain crybaby has some deep things to 

8
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:32,324
say about metaphysics,
the media and even international 

9
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,834
relations.
So welcome with his wives crack 

10
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,910
condition on the philosophy of devil man
crybaby has always spoilers ahead.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,953
And by the way,
we never get it right whether you guys 

12
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:44,204
want dubs or sub.
So we literally flipped a coin in 

13
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:46,490
Atlanta,
did on dubs,

14
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:49,430
so be happy.
But before we get into the recap though,

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,383
I just want you all to know we're 
working hard to put together an animate 

16
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:53,564
podcast.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,553
It's in very early stages,
but a lot of our best video ideas start 

18
00:00:57,231 --> 00:01:00,350
from podcasts discussions.
So subscribe to our channel wise cast.

19
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,750
You get a closer look into our creative 
process.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,490
Anyway.
Onto the recap.

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,623
Akira,
a teenage boy known for crying over 

22
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:08,354
almost anything is living with the Maki 
Mora family while his parents traveled 

23
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:15,350
the world providing free medical care 
when he tries to save his crush.

24
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:16,880
Slash.
Housemate Mickey Mckee,

25
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:20,690
Maura from what looks like a gang,
Aki raise interrupted by his trigger.

26
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,360
Happy adoptive brother and childhood 
friend Rio.

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,373
Recently back in Japan.
After a research project in South 

28
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:29,420
America,
Rio tells Akira what he learned abroad,

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,493
namely that devils are real and that 
they are possessing human beings trying 

30
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:35,324
to collect proof of his theories.
Rio Takes Acura to a drug fueled sex 

31
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,464
party called Sabbath,
where his bloody rampage actually 

32
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:46,100
succeeds in summoning a group of demons,
one of whom tries to possess Acura.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,610
That demon Ayman fails to take over 
Akira completely.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,340
Acura gains the strength and power of a 
devil,

35
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,980
but he's still in control of his mind 
and body.

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,023
You're a man who possesses both the body
of a devil as well as the heart of a 

37
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,640
human devil.
Man,

38
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,840
while Rio and occupy initially planned 
to use his powers to fight the devils,

39
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,980
the show gradually reveals that there's 
more to Rio's plan when the demon thread

40
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:10,814
is revealed to the Public Rio gains.
Immense influence with world leaders 

41
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,803
turns on OC Euro and promotes policies 
which encouraged the murder of not only 

42
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:20,390
devils,
but millions of human beings.

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,000
This all comes to a head in the big 
reveal.

44
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,280
You seen him say,
Yup.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,100
Followed by a massive human devil,
devil,

46
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:31,010
man battle culminating in the end of the
world.

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,000
So how did we get from a bad night at 
the club to the fricking apocalypse?

48
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,103
Well,
the answer has to do with two distinct 

49
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:41,540
but related concepts,
moral panics and threat construction.

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,280
Sociologists,
Stanley Cohen,

51
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,114
argues that mass media constructs a 
moral panic directed at certain groups 

52
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:52,481
of people by portraying their behavior 
as deviant society labels these people a

53
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:53,774
threat which justifies excessive social 
control and policing over the quote 

54
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,963
demonized as he puts it.
The media informs us about right and 

55
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,514
wrong about the boundaries beyond which 
one should not venture and about the 

56
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:09,270
shapes that the devil can assume.
Devil may cry.

57
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:12,220
Baby references a few well known moral 
panics.

58
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,263
For instance,
local news falsely identifies the young 

59
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,324
rappers as members of a gang.
The mistake and their resemblance to be 

60
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,764
constructed.
Stereotype of violent youth nearly gets 

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,890
them shot by police even as they try to 
cooperate with the officers.

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,993
The show also references the archetypal 
moral panic which hunts for her almost 

63
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,760
supernatural speed.

64
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,690
Miki is known to the media as up is 
reach of track and field.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,420
As a result,
the mob calls her a witch.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,140
She's an outsider before killing her and
burning her body.

67
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,183
More to the point though is reos use of 
mass media to create a moral panic over 

68
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,414
devils after triggering code has 
transformation at the track meet and 

69
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,090
causing a massacre.
Rio uses his live stream too,

70
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,120
so fear and mistrust among the general 
population,

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,073
demons exist.
That could be one right next to you 

72
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,383
taking advantage of his academic title.
Rio claims to be merely a reporter of 

73
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,610
the facts.
In fact,

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,473
he uses multiple media outlets including
social media and traditional 

75
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,810
broadcasting to promote as much fear,
paranoia,

76
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,610
and violence as possible

77
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,160
in this battle.
Huggins,

78
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm sure that we will win.
Once again.

79
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,520
As the end of the world draws closer,
Satan slash Rio encourages more and more

80
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:29,354
violence by expanding the definition of 
devils to include anyone deviating from 

81
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:36,710
the social norm.
He falsely implies that deviant behavior

82
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:40,010
is a proven indicator of the potential 
to turn into a devil.

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,913
So you're saying that anyone 
dissatisfied with society can 

84
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:46,320
potentially turn into a demon?
That's correct.

85
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,830
So then in order for us to defeat the 
demons,

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,380
we must eradicate them before they 
become demons.

87
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,250
He pulls off the same feet at the 
international level.

88
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,190
Through our process.
Scholars call the red construction.

89
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,233
Certain camps of foreign policy 
theorists argue that many international 

90
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:06,020
trends positive by national leaders are 
largely constructed.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,190
That is issues become threats when 
people in positions of power define them

92
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:12,860
as such,
like creating a moral panic.

93
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,723
Threat.
Construction involves identifying some 

94
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,603
other,
whether it be another country and 

95
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,340
organization,
et Cetera,

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,233
and defining its otherness as a danger.
The other is portrayed as not merely a 

97
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:25,334
physical threat,
but a threat to the very identity of a 

98
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,244
domestic state political scientist.
David Campbell explains that in the 

99
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:31,904
process of threat construction,
the other becomes the barbarian who 

100
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:38,210
stands in opposition to the quote 
civilized self.

101
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,163
Following this model,
Rio manipulates inherent weaknesses in 

102
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:46,040
US foreign policy to start world war 
three beginning a nuclear conflict which

103
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:46,874
wipes human life from existence.
Rio takes part in a high level 

104
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,510
government discussion about how to 
handle the threat posed by the devils.

105
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,403
By this point,
we're leaders have bought into reos 

106
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,240
logic completely and have become 
distrustful of one another.

107
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,480
We must be careful of the movements of 
neighboring countries.

108
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,840
There's information that they've already
been taken over by the demons.

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,733
In response to the situation,
the u s government reflexively 

110
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:11,960
identifies a Russia as a quote,
geography of evil,

111
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,930
a term coined by Campbell and declares 
the devil.

112
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:17,470
Possessions are the product of a Russian
bioweapon.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,393
The U s department of National Defense 
closed its borders in response to the 

114
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:24,880
possibility of demons being rushes 
biological weapons

115
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,923
in devil man crybaby,
the u s and Russia respond to the 

116
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,624
devil's much as real world governments 
respond to terrorism because the threat 

117
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,360
is barbaric and a threat to 
civilization.

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,070
No measure is too extreme to stop them 
including nuclear war.

119
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,193
No,
I like this.

120
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,780
The minute sure threatens our cow.

121
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,763
The show explores the dangers of 
throwing up artificial boundaries 

122
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,154
between groups.
The bloodshed and heartbreak that fills 

123
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:50,394
up the last few episodes are a direct 
result of the public's willingness to 

124
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,190
buy into rios us versus them mentality.

125
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,600
Maybe you can run faster than people 
because you're a demon.

126
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,030
You think you're better than the 
Japanese.

127
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,140
This preoccupation with boundaries is 
also reflected in the show's exploration

128
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,950
of what's called dual list metaphysics.
So what does that mean?

129
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,630
Doulas and posits that reality is binary
or oppositional in nature,

130
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,583
composed of two eternally clashing 
irreconcilable forces such as good and 

131
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,534
evil.
One of the classic examples of the list 

132
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:23,184
philosophy is the ancient religion of 
Manichaean as religious scholar Todd 

133
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:29,270
calder explains according to Manichaean 
dualism,

134
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,253
the universe is the product of an 
ongoing battle between good and evil 

135
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,344
substances,
which are in a constant battle for 

136
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,010
supremacy.
At first glance,

137
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,230
the show appears full of binary 
oppositions,

138
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,180
which will never be resolved.
For instance,

139
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,810
Rio is distinguished from AH,
era by his inability to shed tears,

140
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,810
which serves as a visual cue for the 
ability to feel emotion.

141
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,920
Why would I cry?
I'm not sad it was going to die.

142
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:51,510
Anyway,

143
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,343
the show also sets up a sharp divide 
between fear based violence and the 

144
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,240
Maki.
Morris Christian passivism,

145
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,840
one of the people who was following 
Jesus pulled out his sword,

146
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,820
attack the soldier and cut off his ear.
So then Jesus said to him,

147
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,150
put away your sword and return it to the
sheath.

148
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,103
Rio is a doulas to the core.
He describes Devil's as fundamentally 

149
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,510
lacking in the human capacity to feel

150
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,800
devils have existed on earth since long 
before humans.

151
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,000
They are ferocious,
extremely savage and have no emotions.

152
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,160
What's more?
The show takes that Manichaean idea of a

153
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:26,994
battle between good and evil substances 
very literally real first discovers the 

154
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,094
existence of devils when the corpse of 
his formerly possessed professor is 

155
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,290
revealed to wait twice the size it was 
when he was alive.

156
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,213
This possession,
in other words was not only spiritual 

157
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,720
but physical.
A case of two bodies,

158
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,410
one good and the other evil fighting for
the same space.

159
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,393
The show emphasizes the material 
dimensions of this battle between good 

160
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:51,870
and evil.
Whenever a devil successfully takes over

161
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:52,704
a human host,
often ripping apart their body in the 

162
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,730
process over time,
however,

163
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,200
devil man crybaby winds up turning this 
dualistic model completely on its head.

164
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,423
The show reveals the socially 
constructed nature of the dichotomies 

165
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:05,994
many of his characters take for granted 
and argues that reality is far too 

166
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,550
complex to be put in terms of black and 
white.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,820
As panic over the devil's thread reaches
its tipping point.

168
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,190
The show blurs the line between good and
evil.

169
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,920
One of the more obvious examples is 
Akira,

170
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,030
who by his very nature challenges reos,
dualistic model of the world.

171
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,223
In one person,
he combines devil and human good and 

172
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,543
evil.
We see this when Auc euro in his devil 

173
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:32,484
man form stands between an angry lynch 
mob and its targets and offers up his 

174
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,830
life for theirs.
Why Chili Java?

175
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,990
If you're going to kill someone,
just chill van stead,

176
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,710
defying the angry and fearful humans 
expectations.

177
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,693
By contrast,
we see an example of supposedly good 

178
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,860
humans resorting to evil when the mob 
dismembers and Burns Mucky,

179
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:54,694
mucky Maura for her public supportive 
Akira and other devilment devil man 

180
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:02,370
crybaby also loves to play around with 
dichotomies surrounding gender and sex.

181
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,383
The show regularly hints at an ambiguous
Lee Queer relationship between hockey 

182
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:07,530
era and Rio.

183
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,513
Aqua remains invested in his ability to 
openly display emotion even after being 

184
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:15,420
mocked for it as a child,
what the heck is crying?

185
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,090
Even though he's a boy?
And in his final form,

186
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,050
Satan embodies both male and female sex 
characteristics,

187
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,260
but perhaps most interesting is the way 
the show blurs.

188
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,094
The line between devils stand ins for 
the outcasts and scapegoats of society 

189
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,593
and the humans they're supposed to be so
different from Mr Machimura eventually 

190
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,560
finds his wife and their son,
Toro in a refugee camp.

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,890
Unfortunately for him,
it isn't the reunion he'd hoped for.

192
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,720
Toro now possessed by the devil can't 
control his own hunger any longer.

193
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,420
His father arrives to find him in his 
demonic form,

194
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,730
eating his own mother.
Mr Machimura tries to fall back on these

195
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:53,564
socially constructed dichotomy between 
devils and humans to reduce Tarro twin 

196
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,690
evil creature and make some sense of the
horror confronting him.

197
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,810
God are no longer my sweet son.
This is for your Oh God,

198
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,940
but in the end he can't help but see his
human son in the devil's crying eyes,

199
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,980
please don't show.
Dot.

200
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,283
The show also provides plenty of 
evidence to exhibit that contrary to 

201
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,420
Rio's claim that devils are incapable of
emotion.

202
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,343
They're actually quite capable of 
feeling love for each other and in some 

203
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,980
cases for humans in the episode,
Beautiful Siren,

204
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,993
a cure.
It gets into what can only be described 

205
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:36,210
as a deadly sex battle with styrene,
the former lover of acuras devil.

206
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,430
Amen.
In the first round of their fight,

207
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,150
Acura and nearly kills siren,
but as she lies bleeding out,

208
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,190
her partner came,
comes to her aid,

209
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,113
offering new give up his life so that 
she can merge with his body and live 

210
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:53,061
long enough to kill devil man site 
bloodied.

211
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,990
You won't be able to fall.
Came sacrifice even causes siren to cry.

212
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,100
Most impressive of all is the change 
that comes over Satan himself.

213
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,680
As a result of his experiences with 
Akira,

214
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,783
having revealed his true form to Akira,
Satan admits that he made the merging 

215
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,104
between him and Ayman possible so that 
Okoro would be able to survive the 

216
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,880
apocalypse and live with him forever.
Oh,

217
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:20,140
a Kiddo.
Let's live in the new world together.

218
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,910
I made you merge with the champion.
Amen.

219
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,913
For that very reason.
What's more when Satan Kills Aki era 

220
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:27,344
during their battle,
he came up the devils experiences grief 

221
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,580
for the first time and cries over era 
his body.

222
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,220
He's awfully

223
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,230
by pointing out fluidity where we would 
expect to find hard boundaries.

224
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,123
Dell man crybaby asks us to think hard 
about the labels we apply to others and 

225
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:53,730
the potential consequences of black and 
white thinking.

226
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,400
The show puts forward some tough 
questions.

227
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,120
Who benefits from media scapegoating and
to what ends?

228
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,253
To what extent does rhetoric play a role
in the identification of threats and 

229
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,600
what are the dangers of being too ready 
to draw lines between self and other and

230
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,434
in a world where categories as basic as 
good and evil are the product of 

231
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:16,110
manipulation and deliberate 
construction?

232
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,213
What is the right thing to do as Mikko 
and her blended human devil man form 

233
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,040
puts it,

234
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,730
what does it mean to be a human?
What does it mean to be guide?

235
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,630
If you're going to die,
hurry up what is right

236
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,480
and as always he's

237
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,780
and wise crack.
We're all about philosophy,

238
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,260
jokes and the rule of threes,
but when the clock strikes five,

239
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,243
everyone's got their own silos.
I draw pictures of dogs wearing Tuxedos 

240
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,060
or people on the Internet.
Yo,

241
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,070
two words,
bro.

242
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,290
I'm going to make bongs out of fruit.
Rollups money.

243
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,220
I run a website that lets me keep track 
of every single bed bug in Los Angeles.

244
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,470
It's my calling.
