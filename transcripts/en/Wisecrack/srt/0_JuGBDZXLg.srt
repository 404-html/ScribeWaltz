1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,060
I think we should make a distinction 
between Islam and Muslims.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,260
What I'm trying to do is to say all over
the world,

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,200
we can identify with each other as human
beings.

4
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:17,210
That is the basic,
um,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,563
glue.
The fact that you are an individual 

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,320
human being and I'm an individual human 
being.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,453
That's what's,
that's where our common commonality or 

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:31,950
common strength lies in and common 
interest Islam.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,980
If we view it as one of the philosophies
are political theories or ideas produced

10
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,500
by human beings throughout history,
just one of them and view,

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,610
it's,
scrutinize it,

12
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,000
criticize it as we have done with all 
other doctrines,

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
religious or secular,
um,

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,663
then we may be able from the West.
Now I'm using [inaudible] as in someone 

15
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:58,884
who is Westernized,
convinced Muslims to make a different 

16
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,594
choice and to reform their faith fast by
acknowledging that there are things 

17
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,670
wrong with their faith.

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,240
So our goal should not be to be,
to preserve Islam.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,430
Our goal should be the common human,
you know,

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,510
we are,
we are human.

21
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,344
So Muslims are humans.
They're not fast meal point just as a 

22
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:26,490
baby in Pakistan or in Saudi Arabia or 
in Yemen or in a Muslim community here.

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,680
If we emphasize that,
then I think we can make that change.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,963
And that involves two things.
That involves learning to distinguish 

25
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,270
between who is an enemy and who is a 
friend.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,410
But before you decide who is an enemy 
and who is a friend,

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,380
you yourself have to decide what do you 
stand for?

28
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,060
What are your own set of ideas that you 
feel as superior to that of Islam?

29
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:54,894
And Are you willing to defend and die 
for your own ideas of freedom and 

30
00:01:58,951 --> 00:01:59,784
humanity and humanism as much as the 
fanatics are willing to die for their 

31
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,390
own.

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,340
There is no consensus in the United 
States on who the enemies and whether to

33
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:12,040
really say it's Islam or it's a 
perversion of a form of Islams.

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,883
It will have is himself as in what was 
it basically just slam a who should we 

35
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:20,340
ally with strategically?
Um,

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,233
in other words,
the approach has been very much 

37
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,663
strategic.
There are people in the United States 

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,240
including this administration who are 
waking up to the fact that it is,

39
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,163
there is a battle of ideas going on,
but they're too shy to voice what the 

40
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,500
ideas are.
Um,

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,513
another point of criticism,
and that's not only towards this 

42
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,144
administration,
but I've seen how it all over the place 

43
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,384
is just this,
this desire to avoid Saudi Arabia as a 

44
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,500
culprit of,
you know,

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,433
the states that's not only financing 
terrorism but also financing the 

46
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,164
ideology behind the terror act.
I think it was a mistake to declare a 

47
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,100
war on terror.

48
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,040
Tara is just a tactic and it shows how 
much,

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,840
how strategic the whole approach is to 
watch what's going on.

50
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,173
Um,
another mistake both on both sides of 

51
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,570
the Atlantic is lit.
If we just appeased them.

52
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:23,290
If you just understand what they want 
from us and we give it to them,

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,180
they might not be so,
so bad to us.

54
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,014
So they might forget what the mates,
I think those are mistakes that were 

55
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,950
made.
But again,

56
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,530
I'll come back to the distinction 
between Europe and America.

57
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:40,480
And it seems as if America is learning 
much faster than Europe and my learning,

58
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,300
I mean waking up to the fact that it is 
Islam,

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,373
not necessarily all Muslims,
but Islamism set of ideas and that 

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,410
that's kind of mean military.
I mean very disastrous military action,

61
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,530
which is for every politician is a 
terrible decision to take to say,

62
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,470
we are going tall,
we are going to do something destructive

63
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,900
or we're going to take an unpopular 
action.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,490
And American seem to be much more 
courageous in making that decision.

65
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,383
They did in the student the Second World
War and later then the Europeans who 

66
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,444
have I,
I think that European data ship at the 

67
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,990
point,
this point is fairly self district,

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,800
and I say this because of the,
the approach to Iran.

69
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,843
Okay.
