00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,810
This episode is brought to you by 
curiosity stream.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,363
What's up wisecrack Michael here.
You may have heard me on our rick and 

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:14,270
Morty podcast where much to my dismay,
jared has dubbed me Dr.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,333
Nihilism.
I've also written some videos you might 

5
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:20,470
recognize like are always sunny episode,
the gaze of the abyss episode,

6
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:23,680
the philosophy of get out and more 
recently our Kayfabe episode.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,180
Today we're continuing our discussion on
the only defense attorney who breaks the

8
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:30,670
law more often than Michael Cohen,
daredevil,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,833
Matthew Murdoch's Catholicism,
has always been a defining element of 

10
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,164
his character and his distinguished him 
from most other nonreligious 

11
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,390
superheroes,
but it's in this most recent season that

12
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:41,224
Catholicism comes front and center to 
understand matthew struggle and why we 

13
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,724
think season three is so awesome.
We'll have to dive into one of the most 

14
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,700
important questions that theologians 
have been struggling with for Millennia.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,593
So join us as we break down how the man 
without fear that comes the man without 

16
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,830
faith in this wise crack.
Quick take on daredevil season three and

17
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:02,290
of course spoilers ahead.
First,

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,153
a quick recap,
some months after the events of 

19
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,524
defenders,
but presumably before the children of 

20
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,820
faint I was double parked their donut 
chip in Greenwich Village,

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,750
Matt Murdock Awakens from a coma and the
church run orphanage he was raised in.

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,940
While the worst of his injuries have 
healed,

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,863
his spirit remains broken.
Daredevil is convinced that his crusade 

24
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:22,900
against injustice had ultimately failed.
As such,

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,853
he takes up residence in the chapel,
undercroft retreating from society and 

26
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,370
allowing his public persona to remain 
dead to the world.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,413
This makeshift bat cave services one of 
the primary set pieces for the season 

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,480
and that constant conversations between 
Murdoch,

29
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,080
fatherland and sister Maggie drive.
Much of the engagement with maths,

30
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:41,914
Catholic faith,
or rather the lack thereof like lex 

31
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:45,514
luther and Batman versus Superman.
Daredevil is blinded by the problem of 

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,983
evil,
which lex summarizes as God is all 

33
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,670
powerful,
cannot be all good,

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,600
and it's all good and he can not be all 
powerful.

35
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,450
In one scene,
Murdoch in Paris has seemingly senseless

36
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,360
suffering to that of Joe Story,

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,900
of God's perfect servant job prayed 
everyday,

38
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,250
dawn with his knees on the ground and is
facing the third slot of 10 goats,

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,440
one for each of his children,
burn them at the alter in God's honor,

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,050
follow God soldiers.
Joe,

41
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,100
he was the most loyal.
I know the story I met you and know what

42
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:24,230
happens next,
gotten murdered.

43
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:28,820
All 10 of his children in cold blood 
scorched every inch of job's land lashed

44
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,270
at his body to his skin was covered in 
bloody welts.

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,473
God range misery on the life of his most
perfect servant and still job and not 

46
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:42,581
cursing what I realized Joe was a pussy.

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,403
Matt wonders why God would not similarly
speak to him whether God had really 

48
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,904
called him to the vocation of vigilante 
and whether God had brought about good 

49
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,710
through the devil of Hell's kitchen.
Unlike the steadfastly faithful job,

50
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,270
murdoch comes to the that God is not 
good.

51
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,510
You might hate God right now,
but the feeling is not mutual.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,650
No,
I don't hate him.

53
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,020
I've just seen as true face as all and 
from the way things are going,

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,870
it seems like he's not wrong.
Throughout the season.

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
More and more evidence mounts for God's 
indifference society seems irredeemably 

56
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,000
corrupt entirely under the control of 
Wilson Fisk,

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,070
fisk bribes and black males,
cops,

58
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,480
feds,
lawyers,

59
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,170
judges and jurist,
turning good citizens into criminals,

60
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,093
law enforcers into lawbreakers,
and the very institutions devoted to 

61
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,970
justice into instruments of injustice,
given daredevils,

62
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,910
Catholicism.
It's after recall the words of Jesus.

63
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,970
Do not fear those who can kill the body 
but cannot kill the soul.

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,300
Rather fear Him who can destroy both 
body and soul.

65
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,680
You know fisk in a nutshell.
Oh,

66
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,683
and we can't not mention the fact that 
this overweight and ostentatious New 

67
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,153
York real estate developer who's 
basically above the law suddenly takes 

68
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,040
up residence and a presidential hotel,
not so subtle.

69
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,800
Marvel daredevils,
new founders,

70
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:05,350
so theism.
That is his anger and frustration at God

71
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,400
amplifies his disgust with humanity.
Thank Godfrey.

72
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,260
He didn't help you.
I did.

73
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,000
He abuses his friends and is generally 
less interested in saving society.

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,050
Then punching it in the face.
Murdoch's broken relationships with both

75
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:21,884
God and the people around him can be 
cast in Catholic terms as a failure to 

76
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:28,190
do what Jesus called the two greatest 
commandments,

77
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,400
to love God and to love your neighbor as
yourself,

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,340
but this itself isn't unique to any 
specific religion.

79
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,383
These two relationships represent the 
two basic axes which believers of most 

80
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,030
religions have to concern themselves 
with.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,950
When deciding how to navigate life is 
specially when sacred and secular duties

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,873
seem to make different demands.
It's here that Matthew directly 

83
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:52,250
confronts an issue Christianity has 
dealt with for centuries.

84
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,203
How does one reconcile and obligation to
God and an obligation to others is 

85
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:00,530
specially if there's others exist in a 
tainted,

86
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:05,531
a moral world or in Christian parlance 
to be in the world but not of the world.

87
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,870
Theologian h dot Richard Niebuhr in his 
book,

88
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:09,704
Christ and culture identify several 
basic answers that Christians have 

89
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,140
offered over the centuries for how to do
so,

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,080
and while he is specifically concerned 
with Christianity,

91
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,590
his paradigm would mostly work within 
any religious tradition.

92
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,573
Briefly,
they can be called one separation to 

93
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,160
accommodation,
free synthesis for paradox and five,

94
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,083
transformation daredevils,
Arkin season three season transition 

95
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:39,410
between two of these models for figuring
out our relationship to God and man,

96
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,320
separation and synthesis,
the former,

97
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,590
which Niebuhr also calls Christ against 
culture,

98
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,603
prescribes a radical renunciation of end
near total separation from the 

99
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:50,834
surrounding society.
This is the path ascribed to you by 

100
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:56,630
monks and Mennonites.
It's also exactly what daredevil does in

101
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:59,630
the early when like the rest of us 
millennials,

102
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,613
he moves back.
Home is a grown ass adult to mooch off 

103
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:06,530
his parents living in their basement and
having his mom cleaned his laundry.

104
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,760
Yes,
really,

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,953
and like a medieval monk,
he's literally cloistered himself in a 

106
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,284
church.
He treats his identity of Matthew 

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,580
Murdoch as dead to the world and 
spirits,

108
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:20,000
his friendships with foggy and Karen,
when they find out he is alive,

109
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,220
he pushes them away,
lies to them,

110
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,113
steals from them,
and treats them as mere instruments of 

111
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,144
his agenda.
As daredevil has mat in the friend 

112
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:31,520
lately without a doubt,
but deep down,

113
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,920
I think it's hurting him as much as it's
hurting us,

114
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,030
is only engagement with the world is 
when he's punching it with his fist,

115
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,750
which is one way to construe being 
against culture neighbor while affirming

116
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,603
that each of his five models was 
partially correct and it times the 

117
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,710
appropriate answer,
nevertheless,

118
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,544
was particularly critical of the 
separation model as overly simplistic 

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,313
and ultimately futile.
No one can completely closed themselves 

120
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:57,824
off to the outside world as daredevil 
discovered the hard way when Bullseye 

121
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,900
attack,
St Patrick's.

122
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,883
It's the turning point of the season and
particularly poignant and it's Catholic 

123
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:07,934
imagery,
all of which make clear to murdoch that 

124
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:10,424
this separation model doesn't succeed in
either serving his neighbors or the man 

125
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,074
upstairs.
First bullseyes eyes attack is a 

126
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:20,120
violation of the long established norm 
of sanctuary.

127
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,253
Karen page had sought safety there from 
the retribution of Wilson Fisk and by 

128
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,574
conspiring to murder her there kingpin 
and Bullseye committed particularly 

129
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,284
agregious sin in the eyes of Catholics 
who see violence on consecrated grounds 

130
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,490
as profaning something sacred.
Then there's the murder itself,

131
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,790
fatherland some sacrifices his own life 
upon the altar,

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,653
saving Karen's his death is an 
unmistakable illusion to Christ claim I 

133
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:49,580
am the good shepherd.
I lay down my life for the sheep pastor,

134
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:53,660
deriving from the Latin for Shepard 
bullseyes diabolical attack,

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,400
his violation of sanctuary and his 
martyrdom of father Lantam are all proof

136
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,690
positive to murdoch.

137
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,020
That is flirtation with the for 
separation model is a failure.

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,033
It's at this point that he [inaudible] 
the uniquely Catholic way of 

139
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:11,870
understanding how to deal with both God 
and the world which kneeboard calls this

140
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:12,704
synthesis model.
The synthesis model affirms that both 

141
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:15,814
the Sacred Institution of the church and
the secular institutions of society are 

142
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,190
both means through which God brings 
about good.

143
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,640
That includes the government as a means 
of bringing about justice,

144
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,980
daredevils,
embrace of the separation model,

145
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:28,814
and the first half of the season 
coincided with his disillusionment with 

146
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,324
the legal system.
He become convinced that the courts 

147
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,114
couldn't successfully serve as God's 
means for enacting justice against 

148
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,834
criminals such as fisk.
So when he later reconnects with his 

149
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,824
friends and with them,
uses the legal system to put kingpin 

150
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,543
back behind bars.
We can see how it's a step towards 

151
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,020
affirming this synthesis model.
Of course,

152
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,700
Murdoch's returned to the fold.

153
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,533
It doesn't happen all at once,
and daredevil tempted up until the 

154
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:00,750
climactic fight to kill the kingpin.
But whereas in the first season,

155
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:04,200
his temptation to finish off fisk was 
simply a struggle with the deadly sin of

156
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,034
Wrath.
Here it indicates Murdoch is still 

157
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,914
questioning whether God is using social 
institutions to bring about good or 

158
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,730
whether daredevil has to take matters 
into his own hands.

159
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,040
At this point,
Murdoch has rejected the separation,

160
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:18,874
just approach,
but it's not until the redemption of 

161
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:21,564
reign of diem that he wants again,
fully affirms the Catholic approach of 

162
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,120
synthesis.
Since the show start,

163
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,500
Murdoch's core conviction has been that 
no one was past the point of redemption.

164
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,340
Batman has his personal code against 
killing that's informed by the murder of

165
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,460
his parents,
but despite sharing a similar origin,

166
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,563
the show is clear that read Batman,
scruples came from his Catholic faith 

167
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,913
for Murdoch.

168
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,843
It'd be a moral to execute his enemies 
because he held hope that even someone 

169
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:51,960
so sinful as Wilson fisk might have a 
change of heart and repent,

170
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,310
but it's not until this season that a 
character that had broke bad is shown to

171
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,450
go good.
Once again.

172
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,523
FBI special agent reign of Diem is one 
of the many government officials 

173
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,770
blackmailed by FIS in addition to other 
crimes.

174
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,160
Nadeem is the accomplished a eyes 
bullseyes murder of father Atlanta,

175
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,263
and yet he's not beyond redemption.
Nadeem agrees to testify against fisk 

176
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,070
knowing full well the danger of crossing
his crime boss,

177
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,760
and when fisk gets to the grand jury,
making the turncoats testimony.

178
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:21,594
Feudal Nadeem instead of running 
voluntarily lays down his life so that 

179
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:29,460
his dying deposition would send the king
pin back to prison.

180
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,430
And this is what finally restores Matt 
Murdock's.

181
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,293
Faith seeing God appear to work,
redemption in human hearts and justice 

182
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,220
through social institutions.

183
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,323
Not separately,
but in synthesis with one another to 

184
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:42,834
bring about good in the world.
This is the ultimate example of 

185
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,960
kneeboards synthesis,
the vertical relationship to God and the

186
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,080
horizontal relationship with man working
together,

187
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,350
the Vertical Relationship Aka Nadine's 
conscience.

188
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:59,100
Getting to tuned is the thing which 
allows the horizontal relationship,

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,150
Aka Society,
including institutions such as the legal

190
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:06,450
system to be the means by which God 
brings about justice.

191
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,530
The two are working together in 
synthesis and without the vertical.

192
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,550
The horizontal would have failed.
The season ends with Murdoch having come

193
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:15,384
through his crisis of faith.
He's no longer sequestered away from 

194
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:18,714
society and the church basement,
but preaching from the pulpit to his 

195
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,194
whole community.
He's no longer a strange from his 

196
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:24,834
friends,
but getting the gang back together in 

197
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,234
the form of Nelson Murdoch and paige 
attorneys at law and he's no longer 

198
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,464
blind to is God's goodness,
but trying to see as much of it as 

199
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,370
possible.

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,710
