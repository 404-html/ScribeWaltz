1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,450
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,220
the basic level it has to do with how 
cells can divide many times.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,720
Um,
what was known,

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,600
uh,
in the late 19 seventies was that,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,970
um,
that when you copy a chromosome,

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,420
the way that the,
uh,

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,370
mechanism copies of chromosome,
every time a cell divides the very,

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,210
very end bit can't be completely copied.
Uh,

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,620
and so then the idea was that the,
uh,

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,420
the chromosomes are the telomeres,
which are,

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,254
the chromosome ends would get shorter 
and shorter and shorter every time a 

12
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:41,250
cell divides.
And that can't happen a indefinitely.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,300
There has to be some mechanism which 
will balance that shortening.

14
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,050
And that's where the discovery of 
telomerase a comes in.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,470
And so for any cell that has to divide 
many times,

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,673
they need to have a way to balance so 
that there's some shortening and some 

17
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,144
lengthening and shortening and some 
lengthening and the equilibrium is 

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,380
maintained,
uh,

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,720
so that the cells can then go on and 
divide.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,860
We were very interested in,
uh,

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,900
as I said,
telomeres and chromosomes and,

22
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:12,980
and how they,
um,

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,033
how they functioned.
And so we really went to the source 

24
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,260
where there are a lot of telomeres.
Uh,

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,153
and this was something that Liz 
Blackburn had done a number of years 

26
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,260
before when she had discovered the DNA 
sequence that telomeres is made up of,

27
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,680
and it's a very,
very simple repeated dna sequence,

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,870
uh,
that is sort of a monotonous many,

29
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,980
many,
many repeats.

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,413
And she had discovered the telomere DNA 
sequence in this organism called 

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,570
Tetrahymena.
It's a single celled organism,

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,553
very much like the paramecium that high 
school students might go out to a pond 

33
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,380
and bring back some pond water and see 
the paramecium floating around.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,650
The thing about Tetrahymena is that they
have 40,000

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,603
chromosomes.
And so it was a very good source to be 

36
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,190
able to understand what the ends of the 
chromosomes were.

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,260
So when we set out to ask,
uh,

38
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,920
is there an enzyme that can lengthen the
chromosomes to balance the shortening?

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,530
We went again to Tetrahymena,
um,

40
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:08,250
and you can just get these organisms and
grow them up in the laboratory.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,180
So we grow up a large batch of the,
of the cells.

42
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:15,040
And then you spin the cells down in a 
centrifuge.

43
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,430
So you make a very compact,
a collection of them.

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,840
And then break them open to get the 
insides of the cells out so that you can

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,350
understand what is going on inside the 
cells.

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,350
I think it's more that the discovery was
made,

47
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,540
uh,
in 1984 and uh,

48
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,110
it was clear that it was important at 
the time,

49
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,040
but it was important as a very basic 
cellular mechanism.

50
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,500
Um,
and uh,

51
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,343
there wasn't a lot of questions.
I didn't get a lot of people doubting 

52
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,274
what the conclusion was,
but instead it wasn't clear what the 

53
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,240
implications were.
And the 25 years that have intervened,

54
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,480
intervened,
uh,

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,383
my lab and Liz is lab and a number of 
other labs throughout the world have 

56
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,910
contributed all kinds of different ideas
from different avenues that have made it

57
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,670
very clear now what the medical 
implications are.

58
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,504
And so there are,
are clear medical implications that we 

59
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,740
didn't know at all.
At the beginning.

60
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,820
We were just solving a puzzle because we
were curious about how cells worked.

61
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,820
Although we knew that it was a 
fundamental mechanism,

62
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,103
we weren't just doing experiments just 
to find out anything but rather to 

63
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,110
really understand how a cell works.
And the 25 years in between really has,

64
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,464
um,
allowed it to be clear what the 

65
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,740
implications of that discovery work.
