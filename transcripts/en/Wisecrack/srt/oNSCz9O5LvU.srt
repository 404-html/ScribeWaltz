The

5
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,560
greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,630
I am your host,
Garrick's wormy Lloyd.

7
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,140
This week's artifact is the Truman show,
starring stand up,

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,030
turned,
impressionist turned comedic,

9
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:42,370
actor turned dramatic actor,
turned comedic,

10
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:45,940
actor turned nihilist.
There's no meaning dynamics slim carry.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,880
The film follows lovable human male 
Truman,

12
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,270
burbank who knows a thing or two about 
sensible sweaters.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,283
What he doesn't know is that he's 
actually on a reality show because who 

14
00:00:56,111 --> 00:01:00,700
needs writers line his town was a movie 
set.

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,210
His town is a movie set and keeping with
Hollywood tradition.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,400
Everyone is fake.
Freaking up.

17
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,234
This freak show is tortured artist,
khristopher tortured because he wears a 

18
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:14,830
bra to ensure truman doesn't get any 
crazy ideas like swimming.

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,693
He makes Truman's dad drink too much.
Flash forward to the college years 

20
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:21,790
season where Truman falls for a sexy 
librarian,

21
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,160
actress,
and after some flirtatious running,

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,880
she tells him those three little words 
every guy wants to hear.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,860
Everything's alive before Truman can 
say,

24
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,180
yeah,
I love you too.

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,760
Production intervenes and whisks her 
away to the h,

26
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:41,650
two o company Fiji inconsolable beyond 
words.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,513
Truman marries the next person he sees,
but Truman can't get her out of his 

28
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,620
hand,
so khristopher tries.

29
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,110
Bird Manningham.
Then it only makes things worse.

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,090
I'm not really sure how it could have 
helped.

31
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,163
Truman starts noticing that his dead dad
looks a lot like the town's only 

32
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,154
homeless guy and more alarmingly that 
someone has canceled his Sirius xm 

33
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,810
before you can say blah,
blah,

34
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,644
blah.
He Truman skipping town until 

35
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,380
Khristopher pulls the old.
There's been a nuclear explosion,

36
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:12,310
so this one road is closed trick and 
like all my family road trips,

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,563
it ends in divorce.
So Truman does his best Saddam 

38
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:19,070
impression and hides when the network 
can't find him.

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,923
They start a human hunt cut transmission
and air reruns of technical 

40
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:23,854
difficulties.

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,490
Khristopher loses a ship,
but immediately finds Truman on it.

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,533
He makes it rain if you catch my drift.
Since HBO still holds the rights to 

43
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,110
violent death,
they stopped the storm and Truman breaks

44
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:35,944
the fourth wall.
Truman tries to punch his way through 

45
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,784
for a hot sec,
but gives up and goes for the fire exit 

46
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,710
instead,
but khristopher has another trick up his

47
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,530
sleeve,
namely a Samsung Galaxy note.

48
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,440
He fires up the PA system that's been 
there the whole time.

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,730
I can hear you and asks Truman back for 
six more seasons in a movie,

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,750
but Truman's agents are sharks and 
that's just the nature of the Biz.

51
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
The Truman show begs the question,
to what extent are recovered by some 

52
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,470
unseen,
all powerful force,

53
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,680
otherwise known as Disney's the force 
for Truman.

54
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,543
It's the latter.
A state referred to as the illogical 

55
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,364
determinism,
but why you got to put a label on 

56
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,180
things.
Every aspect of Truman's life,

57
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,090
from what he eats and where's is 
controlled by Khristopher.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,073
In fact,
Christopher's name is a variation on 

59
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,980
Christ as in Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

60
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,580
Christ.
Through most of the film,

61
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,390
Truman struggles to free himself from 
the system and make his own choices,

62
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,860
only to find offers flashmob poised and 
ready to dance.

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,520
The film frames this age old debate in a
20th century context,

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,950
when most human lives were controlled by
the media,

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,780
instead of the chips inside their 
brains,

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,853
Truman is literally owned by a studio 
well until the right to revert back to 

67
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
marvel has last name.
Burbank is a nod to the California and 

68
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,860
city where the Warner Bros used to do 
keg stands.

69
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,843
As we watch truman get ushered from 
product to product by subtle 

70
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:00,994
advertising.
We can't help but notice the same 

71
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,840
attempts by the media to groom our 
decisions.

72
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,320
That is a beer,
not that I would ever tell you to buy.

73
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,770
Kill Mo's eyebrow wax on sale.
Now for 6,000

74
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,900
Garba trons.
I just wouldn't.

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,770
Truman's journey to discover the truth 
resembles the thought experiment,

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,360
the allegory of the cave by plate.
Oh,

77
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,194
Spaghetti.
The experiment imagines humans chained 

78
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:27,820
to a wall only knowing shadows,
more popularly known as a sex dungeon.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,640
Truman's worldview is similarly 
constrained,

80
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,563
is cave is sea haven.
The actors are his shadows and his hair 

81
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,750
is just perfect.
Plato's oppose that.

82
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,260
Once a prisoner ditched the cave,
he would prefer the outside world to the

83
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,660
dark.
Khristopher disagrees,

84
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,810
I think what distresses you said,
ultimately Truman prefers his cell,

85
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,640
but as the film climaxes Truman calls 
him a liar,

86
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,474
liar.
His perseverance to retire from Showbiz 

87
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,324
is reminiscent of Captain Ahab's classic
struggle with moby penis symbolically 

88
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,690
representing the struggle between 
mankind and God,

89
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,270
the novel ends and a good old fashion 
drowning,

90
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,403
whereas Truman's ends and breathing the 
final frames suggests that humans had 

91
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:18,121
the will to control their own destiny,
which was true until president and Kylie

92
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Jenner found out about it.

I'm Garrick's Romeo void and in case I 
don't see you.

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,860
Good afternoon,
good solstice and didn't

95
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,520
egg wise crack.
Garrett has intern,

96
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,363
jared again.
It took a lot of highly skilled people 

97
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,210
to make the Truman show or reality 
writers,

98
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,200
editors,
designers,

99
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,810
and more all working together to keep 
Truman in the dark.

100

102

good at them.
