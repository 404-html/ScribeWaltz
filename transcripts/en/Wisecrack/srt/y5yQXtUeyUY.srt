4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,460
Greetings and welcome to earthlings 
cinema.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,353
I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.
This week's artifact is team America 

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,270
world police from South Park creators,
Oliver Stone and Matt Parker,

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,630
who were famously exiled from Earth 
after literally pissing off everyone,

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,943
the film opens in France where some 
kindly terrorists chaperone a beeping 

9
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:43,850
briefcase that is until the US Olympic 
team choppers in.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,863
They win the interpretive dance round,
but take home the silver in not dying 

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,503
over on broad street and actor named 
Gary Sings about one of Earth's best 

12
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:54,584
diseases.
Everyone has a attracting the attention 

13
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,750
of agent Colson.
I mean Morpheus,

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,913
I mean a balding horny puppet.
He takes him to Rushmore Academy where 

15
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:06,620
he asks him to do the plot of 21 jump 
street,

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,573
but with terrorists.
Although considering how teens were in 

17
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:10,394
those days,
there wasn't much of a difference in 

18
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,490
Korea town,
a near site,

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,100
a dictator has the terrorists over for 
Kimchi.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,993
Giving them some bombs as party favors,
gary gets his eyebrows done at the spa 

21
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,284
so he can infiltrate the Cantina Bar,
but soon team America shows up and 

22
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:27,470
sweeps the gold medal and destroying a 
native culture.

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,280
America's oldest past time,
the team gets drunk.

24
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:35,000
All friendship and Lisa and Gary do the 
bippity Boppity Boo.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,013
Gary's not the only one getting blown.
Jack donaghy fears the Olympics or 

26
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:42,974
stealing Liz lemon's ratings and 
partners with k town for a piece 

27
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:49,940
ceremony where Kim will secretly 
detonated bombs.

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,060
Oh No,
no air quotes on that one.

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,250
Remembering that it's the end of act 
two.

30
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,930
Gary quits and gets mild.

31
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,000
The

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,690
Fat Guy,
suicide squad's HQ just as Kim blows the

33
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:06,524
team's cover and captures them,
but their covers not the only thing 

34
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,840
getting blown.
That's a call back just for you.

35
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,620
Gary trains with Spotswood,
trainspotting,

36
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,463
if you will,
and they go to k town to get the band 

37
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:17,924
back together.
They kill most of the film actors guild 

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,480
and no intelligent life is lost with the
stage.

39
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:26,930
Empty Gary attention.
Whores it up and engages in the time.

40
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:31,310
Honored tradition of oratory.
The only thing that can be an asshole is

41
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,144
it Dick donaghy gets ousted from NBC and
Kim falls on an outright baseball cap 

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,993
revealing his true form a horse team 
America world police can be viewed as a 

43
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:47,540
response to the surge of nationalism.
The USA experienced after nine slash 11,

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,960
considered by many to be just never 
forgettable.

45
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,123
The film is a satire stylized after 
massive Hollywood blockbusters and 

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,590
Netflix's which commonly celebrated 
American power and perseverance.

47
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,490
The film beats down cliche after cliche 
like they owe it money.

48
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,533
It mocks the emotional levers these 
films try to pull just as it makes fun 

49
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:11,860
of the overly sentimental country 
ballots that make war seemed great.

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,573
The big bangs and puppet bans lies a 
more subtle exploration of America's 

51
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,074
role in the world.
Some scholars support the hegemonic 

52
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,164
stability theory,
which supposes that the world will be 

53
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,550
better off with a superpower calling the
shots.

54
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,670
Team America believes in American 
exceptionalism.

55
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,683
The idea that the United States was 
better than all other seven countries 

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,750
and therefore duty bound to shape the 
world too.

57
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,270
It's obese standards.
Don't you understand?

58
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,163
Every country in the world is in danger.
How is it my responsibility to do 

59
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,214
something because like it or not,
you're the one with the power to do 

60
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,354
something.
The film pokes fun at this attitude by 

61
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:07,030
showing various ways that Americans are 
poorly suited to boss baby.

62
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:07,864
Every one around.
When the film identifies a foreign 

63
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,160
location,
it notes the distance from the USA,

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,083
exemplifying the tendency Americans had 
to look down on other countries as well 

65
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:17,344
as the metric system.
Cities such as Paris and tattooing are 

66
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:24,130
reduced to their most famous landmarks 
which are portrayed incorrectly as being

67
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,830
right next to each other instead of on 
top of each other.

68
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,270
Foreign languages are portrayed as 
Jibberish,

69
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,220
although it's all human.
To me,

70
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,353
this ignorance and lack of respect for 
other countries manifests as team 

71
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:41,380
America demolishes world landmarks to 
make room for a whole food.

72
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,200
Ironically,

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,033
the self centered attitude is similar to
the terrorist psychology according to 

74
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,180
smoking hot,
Lisa,

75
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,600
usually a case of malignant narcissism 
you brought on during childhood.

76
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,670
Damn,
you're tearing me apart,

77
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,504
Lisa.
The film asks whether this careless 

78
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,070
destructiveness and the name of American
ideals is any better than the terrorists

79
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:04,180
intentional attacks because it's the 
thought that counts,

80
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,220
but the film is far from a one sided hit
piece on American jingoism unchained.

81
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,450
It criticizes ignorance on the other 
side of the aisle to the actors standing

82
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,284
in for Alcoholic Grad students,
or liberals think they're better than 

83
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,290
team America.
The film actors guild believes that what

84
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,750
the world needs is compassion,
not violence.

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,960
All the team America does is create new 
enemies,

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,100
but their position is based on the same 
blinding Elitism as team Americas.

87
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
What the world needs is an international
advisory committee who truly understands

88
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:40,060
global politics,
namely us and their ignorance,

89
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,480
causes them to bumble their way into the
wrong side of a global crisis.

90
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,023
Ultimately,
the film concludes that despite the 

91
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,574
occasional terrorist attack,
someone's got to deal with purely 

92
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,640
destructive entities,
especially if those entities can sing.

93
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,603
So really in the end,
the film endorses a more cautious 

94
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,820
America,
but in America,

95
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,320
yeah.
Nonetheless,

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,780
it was the state motto of Florida after 
all,

97
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,003
before it flooded,
and the sharks ate everybody until they 

98
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,314
were dead.

99
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,793
