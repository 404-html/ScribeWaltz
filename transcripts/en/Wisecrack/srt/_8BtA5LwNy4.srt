1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,680
We buy things for wildly different 
reasons.

2
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:16,681
We buy things because they satisfy basic
needs like hunger or thirst.

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,903
Uh,
we,

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,250
we buy products because they make us 
feel good.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,790
They meet our needs of identity or,
or needs of belonging,

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,953
right?
On some level though we buy everything 

7
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:29,740
because it meets some needs that we 
have.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,813
And I think companies have kind of 
gotten a shy about the reasons why 

9
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:35,644
people buy their products.
The biggest myth I have heard in 

10
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,830
corporate America is the myth of the low
interest category.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,620
You'll go into a company that makes 
widgets and they'll say,

12
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:45,454
oh,
well it's a relatively low interest 

13
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,224
category.
It's something that people aren't that 

14
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,230
interested in.
And so,

15
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,190
well,
our biggest,

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,680
you know,
our only choice is to just slice it down

17
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,410
and make it as cheaply as possible.
I don't think that's true.

18
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:59,380
I don't think there is any such thing as
a low interest category.

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,090
Every time we go in.
And,

20
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:01,924
you know,
we study cleaning products when we find 

21
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,610
out that it's really about a mom caring 
for her children and we study,

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,623
um,
soft drinks and we realize it's much 

23
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,310
more about kind of feeling like you have
a sense of identity and belonging with,

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,630
you know,
with a group of people.

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,080
Um,
we study in engineering thermal plastics

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,973
and we discover that it's really about 
chemical engineers who use those 

27
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,350
thermoplastics feeling like they're 
competent in their job.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,790
There's always a human being in a high 
interest factor associated with it.

29
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,500
I,
I've told more than one,

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,581
uh,
you know,

31
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,414
ceo that the first thing he needed to do
was to walk around his company and ask 

32
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:35,524
people,
do you think we have a low interest 

33
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,540
product?
Okay,

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,780
you're fired.
Right?

35
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,693
And get rid of people who don't believe 
that the stuff that you may can change 

36
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:44,920
the world because it is changing the 
world whether they're noticing

37
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,983
or not.
