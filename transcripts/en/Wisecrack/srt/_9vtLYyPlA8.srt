1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,340
Well,
my main job is twice a year to cover the

2
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:09,940
collections each season,
the fall and spring season,

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,643
so we've just had the New York shows 
this fall for spring clothing that will 

4
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:19,330
be in the stores for spring 2009.
This weekend I will leave to go to Milan

5
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:20,164
and I will spend a week.
They're looking at the clothes from the 

6
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,044
Italian designers and then that will be 
followed by a little weakened 

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,270
adventists,
which would be lovely and then onto a,

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,560
which is a break and then onto Paris for
a week of shows there.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,753
So those are the two main large blocks 
of time where I'm literally sitting in 

10
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:39,880
what the fashion engine,
what I would consider to be,

11
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:40,714
what the world would consider trade 
shows and they're the fashions fashion 

12
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:46,630
shows that are called the collections 
for ready to wear those clothes that you

13
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:50,500
will see at various department stores 
and boutiques all around the country and

14
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,810
all around the world as well as online.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,370
That is followed by then a period where 
I come back from the fashion collections

16
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,150
and make some pretty strong decisions on
what trends I like.

17
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,460
What I've seen,
um,

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,573
how I've amassed all this large grouping
of plethora of clothes that are kind of 

19
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,870
bombarded me and everyone for about a 
month,

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,420
um,
make sense of it all and group them into

21
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,254
stories,
into themes and the things that I think 

22
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:16,204
will be relevant for my publication and 
for things that I think will be fun to 

23
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:23,500
photograph and shoot.
And from there I developed the idea,

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,903
think about what kind of imagery I'd 
like those ideas to be and think about 

25
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:29,440
the photography,
the models,

26
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:32,800
and how I'm going to actually really 
produce that idea.

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,130
So it becomes an eight page,
10 page story in the spring issue of New

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,003
York magazine.
