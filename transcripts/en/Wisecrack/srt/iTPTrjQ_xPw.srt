This video is sponsored by movement,
watches in sunglasses,

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:04,500
more on movement at the end of this 
video.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,461
Hey,
wise crack,

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,294
jared here,
we all just saw thor ragnarok and 

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,080
surprise.
We have some thoughts.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,020
Not only is it quite possibly the 
funniest smart movie,

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,290
it's also very close to being the 
smartest.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,303
Like most marvel clicks,
there's a metric buttload of smashy 

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,551
fight,
fight,

10
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:28,300
punctuated by smug.
Self awareness is a friend from work,

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,540
but underneath the ocean of jokes,
fights and uncredited Matt Damon Cameos.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,530
There are a few scenes that speak to 
really interesting ideas,

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,950
but before we dive in any further,
here's your obligatory spoiler warning.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,250
One of the most enduring images of the 
movie is thor missing,

15
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:48,210
and I just like his father odin and we 
couldn't help but ponder.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,343
If in norse mythology,
odin loses his eye to see a greater 

17
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:52,944
knowledge.
What truth does thor see when he loses 

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,003
his eye?

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,240
So let's see why marvel took thor's.
I in this quick take on Thor Ragnarok.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,463
First,
a quick recap for returns to as garden 

21
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,210
from a spirit quest complete with the 
crown of a fire.

22
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,450
Giant only defined Loki in charge 
disguised as Odin.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,673
They go to find the real odin who 
promptly dies immediately after big 

24
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:14,964
sister Hela Goddess of death comes back 
from her banishment to hot topic to 

25
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,480
claim the as guardian thrown and expand 
the empire.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,650
So she destroys thor's hammer and sends 
thor and Loki tumbling in the space.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,860
Thor ends up being a gladiator on a 
planet called Secar.

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,190
Loki weasels himself into Jeff Gold 
boons aristocracy.

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,130
And with the help of new friends like 
Valkyrie and his colleague,

30
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:35,964
the incredible hulk,
thor gets back to asgard by Tele and 

31
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,740
saves his people.
What a ride.

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,020
So sure.
Door fights the hulk again.

33
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,310
Jeff Goldwin plays a space.

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,160
Cj and Loki gets rescued by Acuvi rock 
monster.

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,293
But what's more interesting is rackner 
entrepreneur occupation with the past 

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,643
and how it forms the world we live in.
This is most clearly seen during hellos 

37
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,200
reign over as guard.
When hello arrives,

38
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,034
She sees a fresco depicting as guards 
history as all peace treaties and 

39
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,054
celebrations.
But that's not how she remembers it to 

40
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,654
her as guards.
History is all blood and conquest and 

41
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,770
feeding enemies.
Tour giant Wolf.

42
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,813
She wrecks the fresco revealing one 
hidden beneath one that depicts the 

43
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,700
history.
Odin tried to sweep under the rug.

44
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,100
He anhelica conquering,
killing,

45
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,023
and generally wreaking havoc.
She destroys what appears to be the 

46
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,564
entire as guardian army on her own.
Then brings her old army's back to life 

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,260
and suddenly as guard is just like when 
she left it,

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,010
a military dictatorship run by a power 
hungry deity.

49
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,293
What's really clever here is that just 
as hello wants to reach into the dark 

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,800
and bring the past back to life,
so to do all our central characters need

51
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:47,490
to reconcile with their past in order to
make any progress.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,300
This is the substance buried under all 
the comedy in this movie.

53
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,330
It's interested in how we deal with our 
past.

54
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,010
For the whole,
this is simple.

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,740
Banner has been stuck in hoke mode for 
two years.

56
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,663
It's not until he witnesses his past by 
seeing a video of black widow that he's 

57
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,670
forced to confront what he left behind 
when he flew into outer space,

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,210
allowing banner to emerge and the escape
to truly start.

59
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,700
Valkyrie used to be a member of an 
elite,

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,010
all female as guardians,
strikeforce,

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,853
but ages ago when Hella killed everyone 
but her and a huge battle she gave up 

62
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,790
that life and became a scavenger.

63
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,893
It's only when she confronts those 
memories that she can return to the 

64
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:29,290
heroism she left behind.
Lokeys confrontation with the past comes

65
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,550
through his connection to his brother.
Loki has always wanted thor to recognize

66
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,790
him either with love or fear,
but toward the end of the movie,

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,700
Dor indicates that he no longer cares 
about Loki.

68
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,070
It takes until the last 20 minutes of 
the movie,

69
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,430
but Loki finally realizes that to start 
his own future,

70
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,070
he has to grow out of the person he was 
in the past.

71
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,150
Despite his self aggrandizing battle cry
of your savior is here.

72
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,163
We see real growth in his decision not 
to steal the tesseract and in the fact 

73
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,190
that after the fight he sticks around 
instead of running away.

74
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,560
But what about thor?
Well,

75
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,394
that's the biggest issue with this idea 
of history and what keeps the film from 

76
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,890
being decisively Marvel's smartest 
movie.

77
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,010
We never get to see thor dealing with 
his own history,

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,550
nor with as guards.
The closest we get to this is his battle

79
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,384
with hello,
which could be considered as a 

80
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,130
metaphorical conflict between as God's 
future and it's past.

81
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,750
This is the concept of the heart of full
ragnar rock.

82
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,360
In order to move into the future,
people and societies need to reckon with

83
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:32,020
their past and idea that is very present
throughout human history.

84
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,063
It starts with the way that society's 
tell stories to themselves about 

85
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:36,664
themselves for a long time,
as God presented itself as a warlike 

86
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,010
culture.
When Odin one of the shift toward a more

87
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,844
peaceful arrangement,
he rewrote the history of as guard to 

88
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,874
exclude Hela and all the fighting and 
position himself as a benevolent 

89
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,624
protector.
You've probably heard the phrase that 

90
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,174
history is written by the winners,
but according to scholars like Michelle 

91
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:58,690
from co and Jenny Ed Kins history is 
written for the winners,

92
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,530
but what that means is that history is 
written to justify past violence and set

93
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,840
the stage for whatever needs to happen 
in the future.

94
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,290
Atkins explains this process by 
describing the end of a war.

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,393
Victory Parades,
remembrance ceremonies and war museums 

96
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,960
tell of glory,
courage and sacrifice.

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,913
The Nation is renewed.
The state strengthened with the 

98
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:17,944
commemoration of the past.
We justify the measures taken to reach 

99
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,424
the future.
That means the story of the past 

100
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,063
dictates the future.
We see this idea played with at the 

101
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:31,120
beginning when lokeys disguises Odin,
he's putting on a play recontextualizing

102
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:31,954
his deception as sacrifice and rewriting
the history of as guard with himself as 

103
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:39,190
a hero,
all wild munching on fresh grapes.

104
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,143
The as guard around him is centered on 
indulgence and celebration and Loki 

105
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,090
crafts its history to justify that 
behavior.

106
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,343
He's not the only one to pull this trick
and he's certainly not the most 

107
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,674
dangerous for Hela as guards.
History is inextricably tied to this 

108
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,724
idea of place.
She believes that expanding the 

109
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,690
territory of as guard is the same as 
making as guard.

110
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,260
More powerful.
This equation of a people to a place has

111
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,094
a long role in human history.
Theorist David Campbell explains the 

112
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,750
dangers of time,
political identity,

113
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,584
and security to a single place.
One of his ideas is essentially that 

114
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:13,964
when a population and its power is tied 
to a place that makes everyone outside 

115
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,004
of that place and enemy and a potential 
threat and in a world full of potential 

116
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:23,744
threats,
safety is an illusion and that means 

117
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:30,640
hell is wars would wage forever.
It takes a visit from ghost dad for thor

118
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,483
to understand that the people of Asgard 
matter more than the place or even the 

119
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:37,640
name.
This is the epiphany that lead owed into

120
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,474
casting hell out her militarism based on
defending the land of as guard from 

121
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:46,790
threats or expanding its power would be 
the ruin of the people of Asgard.

122
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,930
This is why thor loses his eye in norse 
mythology.

123
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,720
Odin trades his iphone knowledge.
Similarly,

124
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,554
thor loses his eye in the moment when he
finally sees the truth that what really 

125
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:02,090
matters isn't territory.
It's the people who create the culture.

126
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,253
In the end,
Loki unleashes the fire giant who 

127
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,354
destroys as guard and hello whippet by 
destroying the territory and making the 

128
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,390
as guardians,
nomadic space travelers.

129
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,403
They now have a chance to create their 
own history unbound from the past 

130
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,270
despite the pain it brings underneath a 
secar sized pile of space,

131
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,580
junk,
special effects and fantastic jokes.

132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,653
Ragnarok is a movie about how we 
understand national social and personal 

133
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,704
identity in the context of our past,
whether for better or worse those paths 

134
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:32,894
and form our futures and only by 
confronting them directly can we ever 

135
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,510
really move on.
Hope you guys enjoyed the movie.

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,130
Thanks for watching peace.

137
