Hey wisecrack jared here.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,770
It all started when someone at the 
office said,

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,170
jared,
got to watch the boss baby.

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,263
So I did.
And then perhaps reluctantly we covered 

7
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:27,850
it on our movie podcast.
Show me the meaning and yes,

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,713
shameless plug.
Check it out using the link in the 

9
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,354
description and let me tell you 
something odd happens to you when you 

10
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,160
spend hours thinking about the boss 
baby.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,113
Soon it became a semi ironic obsession.
And then after it got nominated for an 

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,643
Oscar,
we said we have to do a video on the 

13
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:44,584
boss' pain.
So we're going to do something a little 

14
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:46,804
different today.
It's not that the boss baby is a 

15
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,550
deliberate and nuanced exploration of 
childhood psychology,

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,420
it's more holy.
This movie accidentally shows us how the

17
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:59,680
way we currently think about love is not
only ruining us but our future children.

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,440
So if you thought the tide pod challenge
was bad for kids,

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,440
strap in for this wise crack condition 
on the boss baby.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,450
And as always,
and if you care,

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,730
spoilers ahead.
Let's start with a recap.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,520
Tim is living a perfect childhood with 
his family.

23
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,390
It's nothing but imaginary ventures and 
expensively licensed lullabies,

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,800
blackbird singing in the dead of night

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,263
until the baby shows up.
Suddenly Tim's parents need to spread 

26
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:24,314
the love around and tim finds himself 
struggling with not being the center of 

27
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:28,064
attention.
Tim Learns that this is no ordinary 

28
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:33,680
baby.
It's an Oscar nominated boss baby.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,620
It can talk,
hold meetings and eat solid food.

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,663
At first,
tim tries to expose the babies bossy 

31
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,124
ways,
making a be suited baby Mike Freak is 

32
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,120
Paris out enough that they,
I don't know,

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,983
throw the baby away or something,
but the boss baby isn't going out like 

34
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,524
that and outwit him at every turn.
Tim Learns the baby is only around to 

35
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,174
foil puppy Co's,
mysterious new puppy that threatens to 

36
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:58,700
make babies obsolete somehow.
So he agrees to help.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,713
Tim and the Oscar nominated boss baby 
sneak into puppy code to conduct some 

38
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,374
corporate espionage.
They're madcap adventure goes off the 

39
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,510
rails and they end up in Las Vegas 
saving their parents from a rocket ship.

40
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,640
With the help of a tidal wave of 
puppies.

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,370
It's weird.
So what's the movie really about?

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,290
Well,
the short answer is easy.

43
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,500
La La,
la,

44
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:18,111
la,
la,

45
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:18,731
la,
la,

46
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,880
la,
la La.

47
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,580
No,
it's about love.

48
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,030
Tim wants his parents love the boss.
Baby wants to win the market.

49
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:28,864
Share of love back from those Gosh Dang 
puppies and the villain wants to steal 

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,280
love away from babies.

51
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,750
No one will ever want a baby,
ever,

52
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,863
ever.

53
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,960
It all comes back to love.
In the end.

54
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,853
Tim and the boss baby have a delightful 
reunion when they realize that love is 

55
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:48,580
not a finite resource.
There's enough for everyone.

56
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,683
Now that's a nice message and all.
But anyone who's ever had a high school 

57
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,380
crush knows we don't always get the love
we want.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,890
Now I know.
Who Cares?

59
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,440
A silly kids movie has a reductive view.
Love.

60
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,880
So what?
Well,

61
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,930
this view on love isn't just simplistic.
Some might call it dangerous,

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,130
like known Weirdo and everyone's second 
favorite psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.

63
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,700
One of the cons fundamental ideas is the
idea of lack.

64
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
In short,
Lacan says that we spend our lives 

65
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,420
looking for meaning unity and peace,
but those aren't real things.

66
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,313
We're never going to find them,
and the desperate search for them is 

67
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:23,794
what makes people neurotic.
We developed social and psychological 

68
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,304
disorders to cope with the fact that 
despite how badly we want life to be 

69
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,730
perfect,
it never will be and it's this lack that

70
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,580
defines tim struggle in the film curl 
ICAN.

71
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,880
It all starts with a childhood trauma 
called the mirror stage.

72
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,863
When we're babies,
we don't really know what the hell is 

73
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,010
going on around us,
but everything is awesome.

74
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,010
We're fed,
we're taking care of and it's all good,

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,993
but eventually we see ourselves in a 
mirror and realized we're not part of a 

76
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,010
comfy,
cozy world,

77
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,680
but just one little being in a giant 
world,

78
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,940
that realization hurts.
It's when we realize we're on our own.

79
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,850
We see this phenomenon play out in boss 
baby too.

80
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,470
I'll be,
it's a little differently.

81
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,603
Tim is naive to the fact that the world 
doesn't cater to his every need until 

82
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,030
the boss baby shows up and he is 
traumatized.

83
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,983
Suddenly the world isn't all about Tim,
is parents only have a finite amount of 

84
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,060
love to give.
Moms.

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,730
Dad don't even know you.
They love me.

86
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,430
Oh yeah.
Do the math kid.

87
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,503
There's only so much love to go around.
It's like these beats you used to have 

88
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:32,790
all your parents love all their time,
all their attention.

89
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,720
You had all the beads,
but then I came along.

90
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,440
Babies take up a lot of time.
They need a lot of attention.

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,950
They get all of you obviously didn't go 
to business school.

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,693
This theory that there isn't enough love
for everyone is the foundation of every 

93
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:51,594
Oscar nominated choice.
The boss baby makes tim tries to live 

94
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:55,860
with the baby,
but he can't.

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,430
It can sucks,
so he tries to expose him so his parents

96
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,264
will get rid of them.
No dice even jumps over a train and 

97
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,980
sneaks onto an elvis themed flight to 
Vegas,

98
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,920
all to make this baby go away.
Why?

99
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,610
Because the baby interrupted his notion 
of how love works.

100
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,450
Life was good.
Life was perfect,

101
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,733
but as I drifted off to sleep,
something my parents said got me 

102
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,590
thinking,
where do babies come from?

103
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,563
No matter how much,
this feeling of having your ideal 

104
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:24,844
reality shattered may suck.
It's an essential stage of human 

105
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,630
development.
However,

106
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,540
instead of having tim move past this 
difficult stage,

107
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,420
the film doubles down on his childish 
fantasy,

108
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,360
suggesting that love is in fact 
infinite.

109
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,403
Tim writes a letter to the boss,
baby sing that there's plenty of love 

110
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,510
for both of them as long as they have 
each other.

111
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,880
It's heartwarming,
but for Lacan,

112
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,893
desire for love,
for anything else is insatiable because 

113
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:54,280
the world will never be perfect.
It's the inevitable outcome of lack will

114
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,890
never have the flawless complete life we
want.

115
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
So we focused on specific things as 
objects of desires or an individual 

116
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,160
problems as the source of our suffering.
In other words,

117
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,600
Tim's idea that love can or should be,
infinite is a fantasy,

118
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,200
and boy does tim love fantasy.
Throughout the movie,

119
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,350
we see him creating fantasies to 
represent the world around him.

120
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,900
He uses those fantasies to entertain 
himself,

121
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,140
to show his feelings and to grapple with
how love works.

122
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,123
In the end,
we learned the whole movie is just a 

123
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,680
story adult him is relaying to his 
daughter to prepare her for a sibling on

124
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,250
the way to story Daddy.
Well Sweetie,

125
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,170
that's how I remember it,
but you know what?

126
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:37,040
I found out what there's plenty of love 
for everyone.

127
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,700
Lacan might say.
This poses a few issues by creating this

128
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,780
bizarre narrative about a ruthless 
corporate baby who threatens to close on

129
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,910
all the market share of love in his 
family unit.

130
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,580
Tim Is essentially demonizing his little
brother.

131
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,880
The deal with the fact that love is not 
in fact intranet,

132
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,013
but whether finite or not,
we're always going to want more and 

133
00:06:56,481 --> 00:07:00,920
we'll never get all the love we want.
This targeting of a single cause for all

134
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,754
our problems is something that Lacanian 
scholars and also regular people refer 

135
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,380
to as scapegoating.

136
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,110
In the case of the family,
we developed neuroses,

137
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,944
a cope with the feelings of isolation 
that start with the mirror stage or we 

138
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,680
fabricate a story about a giant 
corporation of babies.

139
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,543
The justify hating her little brother.
We see the same thing happened with the 

140
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,174
villain.
Francis Francis formerly super colossal 

141
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,694
big fat boss baby.
He becomes an evil psychopath and tries 

142
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:29,420
to steal love from all babies because 
his fantasy of staying a baby forever is

143
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:32,300
taken away from him and he blames all 
other babies.

144
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,313
This is what happens when we expect a 
perfect world and don't get what we 

145
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,824
want.
We act like babies but not necessarily 

146
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:39,854
the Oscar nominated con and then Tim 
does quite possibly the most 

147
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,333
irresponsible thing ever.
He passes his fantasy and all the 

148
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,920
neurotic baggage that comes with it on 
to his daughter.

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,993
Inundating your daughter with the idea 
that your basic desires will always be 

150
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,564
fulfilled is well not great.
That will probably lead to some issues 

151
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,390
down the line like whatever happened to 
this kid,

152
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,930
like get out of my face and make no 
money.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,630
What are you wearing?
So

154
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,463
what's the deal?
Is it just that love is another one of 

155
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:09,984
the many things we're programmed to want
but doom to never get enough of not so 

156
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:14,394
fast.
The con might say there is in fact a 

157
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:16,614
secret way around the problem of love 
and fantasy and it's also hidden in the 

158
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,514
Oscar nominated story of the boss baby.
What the movie's ending gets right is 

159
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:24,444
that the love between the brothers is 
the healthiest relationship we see in 

160
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:30,000
the movie,
but that's not because love is infinite.

161
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,013
Instead,
it's because love depends on showing us 

162
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:35,310
how much we're missing.
You don't even know what it's like to be

163
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:38,280
part of a fair and you don't know what 
it's like to have a job.

164
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,710
Lacan famously referred to love as to 
give.

165
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:43,350
What one does not have.
When we love someone,

166
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:44,184
we reflect their lack back to them.
We show them what they are missing and 

167
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,084
for Lacan that confrontation with LACC 
is far more psychologically curative 

168
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,530
than covering over our desires with 
fantasies and scapegoats.

169
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,423
If we accept that definition of love,
it's hard to argue that the brothers 

170
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,050
don't live up to it from the very 
beginning.

171
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,560
Their position not just as opposites but
as complimentary.

172
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,500
Boss baby is practical,
but tim is a dreamer.

173
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,410
The boss baby writes memos.
Tim Takes Action.

174
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,410
Tim has experienced love and values it 
immensely.

175
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,590
Boss baby has never been loved and isn't
too worried about it.

176
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,220
I may look like a baby,
but I was born all grown up,

177
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,030
never had someone to love you.

178
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,470
Well,
you can't miss what you never had.

179
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,390
They each cover the other's flaws and 
reflect them back to each other in a way

180
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:30,820
that helps them both grow and save the 
day.

181
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,773
It's the boss baby's motivational skills
that keep tim on the bike once he loses 

182
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,064
the training wheels.
The path to success is not a straight 

183
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:38,944
line templeton,
but rather a wild ride and it's Tim's 

184
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:41,764
imagination that allows them to defeat 
Francis Francis in the end by showing 

185
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:48,310
the other what they're missing and 
embodying those values,

186
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,233
they help each other grow into more well
rounded and healthy individuals per 

187
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,383
lacan.
Love isn't meant to fill in the gaps we 

188
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:58,060
fill in our lives,
the attempt to make life perfect.

189
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,953
It's exactly what leads to neurosis and 
pathology and all kinds of other messy 

190
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:03,460
things.
Instead,

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,353
love shows us what we're missing and 
makes it okay because we see what is 

192
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:10,570
missing in someone else.
Maybe it seems like we're going a little

193
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:14,890
overboard on a movie about a baby who is
somehow paradoxically a boss.

194
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,723
But this is an important lesson.
Real life is full of disappointment and 

195
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:22,690
few if any things live up to the world 
we imagine,

196
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,130
but that's no reason to get depressed.
Oh you need to do is realize that things

197
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,910
aren't going to be perfect.
Not everyone gets nominated for an Oscar

198
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,420
and once you see that imperfection 
reflected in the world around you,

199
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,220
it's really not so bad.
Thanks wise crack.
