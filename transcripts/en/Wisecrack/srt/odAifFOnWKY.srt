00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,910
Greetings and welcome to earthlings 
cinema.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,980
I am your host,
Garrick's wormy Lloyd.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,993
This week's artifact is the prestige 
starring Huey Lewis and the newsy and 

7
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,064
directed by neither one of them.
The film tells the story of Angier and 

8
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:30,754
Borden to Earth Shamans who become 
rivals over a simple misunderstanding 

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,210
about whether engineers wife should be 
alive or not.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,580
They take turns injuring each other's 
frail,

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,414
mortal bodies and snooping in each 
other's diaries for hot smut went ng or 

12
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,154
finds out.
Borden has a new incantation called the 

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,140
Trans Man.
He becomes obsessed with finding out how

14
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:52,510
it all works without,
you know,

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,390
sticking his foot in his mouth.
He tries using a double.

16
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:58,900
He conveniently finds wandering around 
10 feet outside the building,

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,770
but the double soon fines.
He has more of a passion for Trapeze,

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,693
so angier kidnaps fallon,
borden's assistant who never speaks and 

19
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,290
whose face we never see clearly.

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,470
Somehow without ever looking at his face
or talking to him,

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,370
borden relents and gives them a clue.
The Tesla model three,

22
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,263
so angier drives is affordable,
yet stylish electric car across the 

23
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,254
ocean to America to find Nicholas Tesla 
and bully him into building a 

24
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,064
transmogrification machine and you're 
successfully uses the machine and 

25
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:32,170
becomes the biggest hippo on campus and 
that makes borden have very sad hippo.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,760
A very sad hippo.
Indeed Michael Caine is in this movie in

27
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:40,240
case that wasn't clear,
borden sneaks backstage to investigate,

28
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:41,074
only to find engineers stupidly drowning
in a water tank like some sort of 

29
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:44,974
noninvasive yes mammal borden is 
arrested and found guilty by reason of 

30
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,174
proximity,
you will by the neck until borden is 

31
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:53,224
murdered by the earth government.
And only after he's fully choked out 

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,943
does Sir Michael find out the Pepsi 
Twist Angier is still alive and kicking 

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,970
with one of his feet at least who's 
still alive.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,953
It seems angier has been suicidal 
himself at the end of every performance 

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,100
leaving behind a fresh baked clone to 
live until the next one.

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,173
Then just as Angier is patting himself 
on the back board and shows up and 

37
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:17,224
performs his greatest trick,
shooting him with a gun by one Pepsi 

38
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,680
twist,
get the second for half price.

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Borden is actually two twin brothers who
would trade off being borden and fallon,

40
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,910
depending on who was having a better 
hair day.

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,003
Angier bleeds out all his remaining 
blood and borden meets up with that 

42
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:35,794
double crossing legend of stage and 
screen to retrieve his daughter who is 

43
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:39,724
also a part of this in the prestige.
Shamanism is a metaphor for 

44
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:43,834
storytelling,
which is a euphemism for talkies at the 

45
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:49,180
start of the film cutter explains the 
structure of a magic trick.

46
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,020
The magic trick consists of three 
policies.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,910
This progression also reflects the three
act structure.

48
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,280
The comprises the bulk of Hollywood 
features.

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,563
Even Beverly Hills Act.
One is the pledge in petition shows you 

50
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,450
something boldly colored bird or man in 
the world of film.

51
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,720
This translates to the introduction of 
characters and conflict.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Generally something to do with not 
having a date to dog prom.

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,200
Act Two is the turn.
The second eight is cool.

54
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,090
The magician takes the picture which 
gets its name because act one turns into

55
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,730
act two,
act two introduces complications.

56
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,760
In this case,
the advent of borden's trans man trick,

57
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,750
which ignites and years descent,
and a nonbinary openmindedness.

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,553
The turn culminates when engineers 
activates the machine and the audience 

59
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,760
is left wondering when Batman is going 
to show up.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,170
I must leave the board.
Yes.

61
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,570
You sitting there and reading my diary 
awaiting a death.

62
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,060
Somebody under act three is the 
prestige,

63
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,880
which coincidentally is also the name of
the film.

64
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,163
This is when the story gathers the 
narrative threads and ties them into a 

65
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,740
neat little bowflex climaxing and a 
grand flourish significantly.

66
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,230
The structure is explained by a man 
named cutter,

67
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,680
a term that references an editor's role 
in pieces of film together.

68
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,723
Too Bad,
our editors are pieces of unwavering 

69
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:21,400
professionalism,
knows how to do his job just as a shaman

70
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,650
distracts us with techniques like 
needlessly vulgar imagery or a needless.

71
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:29,610
The attractive assistance pretty 
assistant is most affective for Mr.

72
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,263
the film diverts the audience from the 
twist even while dangling it right in 

73
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:36,580
front of our state of the art ocular 
implants,

74
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,670
but child guesses immediately that the 
birdcage trick used the twin cutter even

75
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:46,390
comes right out and states it comes out 
at the end is the only way,

76
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,283
but the audience is so dazzled by 
showmanship and the advent of 

77
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,614
electricity that we are still gobsmacked
when borden finally explains all of 

78
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,374
which goes to prove cutters theory,
whether watching a magic trick or a 

79
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,980
movie or a donkey show,
the audience wants to be fooled,

80
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,843
swept away by the narrative so that we 
may be wowed at the end because no one 

81
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,070
goes to a donkey show.

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,340
For the previews,

84
