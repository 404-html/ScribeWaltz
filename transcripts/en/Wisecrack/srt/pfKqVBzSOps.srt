1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,640
This episode is brought to you by even 
cero watches.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,270
What's up guys?
Jared here,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,403
if you've been following South Park and 
our South Park podcast perspect our 

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,233
authortalk,
you've probably noticed that the show 

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,674
feels a little different these days.
Last season South Park often explored 

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,870
our reactions,
the current events,

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,460
especially outrage and despair.
And while that's still front and center,

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,880
this season hones in on a different 
feeling resignation.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,200
So far south park has been showing how 
the modern world has overwhelmed,

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,153
devastated and just exhausted us.
So let's get super depressed about the 

11
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,950
world in this wise crack.
Quick take on the first four episodes of

12
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:50,610
South Park season 22 and is always 
spoilers ahead.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,530
But first a quick recap of the season.
So far in episode one,

14
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,550
Sharon freaks out about the daily school
shootings at South Park elementary

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,493
chosen were shot.
They were killed at a school where they 

16
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:04,130
were supposed to be

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,710
[inaudible].
No one else seems to care.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,260
Uh Huh.
What else is going on?

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,213
Meanwhile,
Cartman is Jessica Jonesing to 

20
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:14,120
investigate these seemingly impossible 
claim.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,360
That token hasn't seen Black Panther in 
episode two.

22
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:20,540
Father Maxi.
Now the butts of a plethora of pedophile

23
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:25,010
jokes leaves his post in a crisis of 
faith only to find hope with butters.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,290
Now of course,
a priest being best friends with the kid

25
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,124
is a bad look and the archdiocese 
mistakenly sends out a cleanup crew to 

26
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,500
take care of the issue.
Episode Three C's,

27
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,360
south parks,
resident Christmas mass,

28
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,590
Scott lose his position after a series 
of ambient fueled tweets.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,693
While episode four takes the Marsh 
family from South Park to a Colorado 

30
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,580
weed farm or randy goes toe to toe with 
big vape.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,940
So what do all these episodes have?
Income?

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,953
A few things,
but we're going to start with maybe the 

33
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:56,150
biggest sensitization.
Don't understand South Park's commentary

34
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,230
on desensitization.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,213
We have to understand the way the media 
contributes to an alters collective 

36
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:02,564
grief scholars,
Arthur and joan climb and describe the 

37
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:05,714
way in which images of suffering are 
appropriated to appeal emotionally and 

38
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:10,304
morally to certain audiences and how 
these images have become extremely 

39
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:15,710
important to the media.
The problem,

40
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:16,544
however,
is that aside from just reporting on 

41
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:21,710
tragic events,
the media commercializes victims who are

42
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:25,880
taken up into processes of global 
marketing and business competition,

43
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,043
when experiences turned into commodities
that are leveraged by mainstream or 

44
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:34,160
social media to give us all the fields,
something strange happens.

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,990
The result is that in the end we become 
numb to the suffering of others.

46
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,223
South Park is telling us something.
We already know that it's easy to be 

47
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,850
impassioned about a thing at first,
but it's equally easy to burn out.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,313
In episode one,
we see southpark beset with a plague of 

49
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:54,500
school shootings during which most 
behave with a colt nonchalance.

50
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,810
Well,
I got this one.

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,070
Nobody seems to give a shit except 
Sharon

52
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,070
series.
Did you not hear what your child said?

53
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,600
Kids died at his school

54
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,770
instead of listening to her,
please to think of the children,

55
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,813
Randy and the rest of south park believe
the real issue is that she's on her 

56
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:17,210
period or worse entering menopause.
You see Mr.

57
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,043
Marsh,
menopause is almost like a super period 

58
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,420
and it's been known to last for up to 
two years.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,023
Oh by God and from their episodes three 
and four open with gunshots at South 

60
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,510
Park elementary before panning over to 
tell the more pressing story.

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,173
Desensitization is so rampant.
The citizens of south park aren't even 

62
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:43,850
outraged about Catholic priests 
molesting children.

63
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,370
They've simply resigned to making jokes 
about it.

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,293
The great one,
Nelson Salvation in a little boy's 

65
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:50,720
mouth.
I'm going to post that one for sure.

66
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,390
Even when his son is theoretically in 
danger.

67
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,170
Randy can help but crack jokes and post 
them on social media,

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,190
but where would prisco this late at 
night to a midnight sale at boys Rs.

69
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,480
What'd she say?
She sat too.

70
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,890
I midnight sale at buys our eyes.
Got It.

71
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,080
Can I pose that?

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,033
We see here how social media makes it 
that much easier to become desensitized 

73
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,820
by berating us with images and ideas of 
suffering.

74
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,650
Even providing an incentive to think of 
these things as jokes or potential posts

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,280
rather than serious events.
In all these cases,

76
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,740
no one even tries to make the world any 
better.

77
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,880
They're too busy just trying to bear the
nightmare world they're living in.

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,460
So how can these horrible things be 
fixed?

79
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,190
If everyone has become indifferent,
to be blunt,

80
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,323
they can't.
The people just become exhausted and 

81
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:39,964
eventually submit.
No matter how much sense Sharon makes 

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,230
the townspeople write her off and 
eventually she becomes comfortably numb,

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,513
barely reacting.
When her son stand becomes the latest 

84
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,740
victim in a school shooting.
It's not the end of the world.

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,160
Maxis quest to become a better priest 
ends the same way.

86
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,630
He rejects the churches institutional 
coverup of the kid touching epidemic and

87
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:04,530
slaughters the clean up crew with their 
own home boney,

88
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,110
but he's also accepted that he can't 
save the church,

89
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,080
nor can he expect the adults to change 
their behavior.

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,140
All he can do his vow to do the right 
thing.

91
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,273
As an individual,
it looks like there's not much choice 

92
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:22,060
but to go with the flow and accept the 
world as given as horrible as it is,

93
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,910
which is a lesson kyle learns the hard 
way,

94
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:25,744
courtesy of his good friend Mr Hankey,
when everyone's favorite Christmas poo 

95
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:32,410
finds himself in trouble for taking 
ambien and tweeting things like

96
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,930
the city council members are a bunch of 
pussy licking is llamas.

97
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
Mr Hankey not only refuses to admit he 
did anything wrong,

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,553
he continues to act like an asshole.
Mr Hankey looks for help clearing his 

99
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:44,874
name,
but no one will help him because as 

100
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,460
Gerald says,

101
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,760
I learned a long time ago that if you 
defend poop,

102
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,410
you get stained.

103
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,600
Finally,
Mr Hankey finds hope in Kyle who vows to

104
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,730
stick by his friend.
Meanwhile,

105
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:01,520
strong woman gives birth to a quintuplet
of PC babies who react negatively to any

106
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,180
violations of political correctness.
X gives me,

107
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,570
sorry I until food aisle.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,833
The babies and the Hanky collide when 
the Christmas Poo puts on an early 

109
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:15,590
Christmas celebration and the baby's cry
at even the most benign of holiday.

110
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:16,424
Well wishes Mr Hankey goes off the rails
and Kyle's attempts to calm the 

111
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,474
situation.
Leaves him stained both literally and 

112
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,810
metaphorically.
Yeah,

113
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,653
like in the end,
Heil has to give up and stop defending 

114
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:35,190
his friend because if he doesn't,
he'll get ostracized to they're gone.

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,920
You went then to erase me too.
It turns out Cartherin was right.

116
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,150
I want to stand by my friend.
Let's see how that goes for you in 28

117
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,120
so what happens when you want to fight 
back against an exhausting,

118
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:56,410
infuriating world when you want to just 
make things better or steep?

119
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,244
The pressures of modern life aside from 
the gunshots in the intro episode four 

120
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,470
starts very differently than the others.
Instead of being desensitized,

121
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,453
we see randy finally get riled up after 
three episodes of handwaving the crises 

122
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,530
around him.
What possibly moves randy,

123
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,840
just take action.
A picture of a dog's butthole.

124
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,410
Seriously.
Dog's butt hole.

125
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,300
That's what we're doing now.
Huh?

126
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,243
From there,
he decides to abandoned South Park and 

127
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,524
move on up to Colorado bar where he can 
live a life of tegrity there he starts 

128
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,074
growing weed but refuses to participate 
in the progress promised by executives 

129
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:38,771
at big vape there by pitting his tegrity
against their concepts of progress.

130
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,290
Your Mommy teach you.
It doesn't pay to mess with progress.

131
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,150
Yeah,
she taught Ms.

132
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:45,130
Dot.
Mouse too.

133
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,990
If you're going to fight for your 
tegrity,

134
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,250
don't forget to bring it down.
Of course,

135
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,760
this is funny because randy really has 
no tegrity to speak of.

136
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,733
His home spun style doesn't come from 
growing up on a farm or being born into 

137
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,240
the life.
It's just a random choice.

138
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:07,241
A guy in a small town made his accent is
a clear expectation that he picks up and

139
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,390
drops on a whim.

140
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,303
Yeah,
whatever all you're doing is blowing 

141
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,650
smoke.
Sorry,

142
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,300
Freudian

143
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,870
deep.
What happened to your accent?

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,753
He even uses the language of Tegrity as 
an advertising device at the end of the 

145
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:22,580
episode made with a little color out of 
integrity.

146
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,880
In the end,
his tegrity nonsense is made of the same

147
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,840
stuff as the claims to progress that 
carbon and the vape executive make.

148
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,960
You can be a part of progress or you can
get run over by it.

149
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,823
Just as tegrity is a costume randy puts 
on to sell the jungle Kush progress is 

150
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,804
just an advertising device.
It's an excuse to move a product with 

151
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,690
flavors that target children

152
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,410
relax,
trust,

153
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,040
and can we based on price

154
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,770
and south park even the attempts to heal
such an exhausting world,

155
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,310
whether through progress or integrity 
are totally self and foolish,

156
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,010
but what does tegrity even mean while 
the hero's try to hash it out.

157
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,844
Check out our southpark podcast,
respect our authority links in the 

158
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:06,744
description

159
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,063
and as you guys may have noticed,
I've dialed it up a little bit today 

160
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,900
with this little bad boy of in Shero 
Watch.

161
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,030
It's actually been years since I've 
owned a watch,

162
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,580
but I got to tell you now that I've got 
this finch Arrow,

163
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,773
I'm digging it,
especially since I'm trying to stop 

164
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,384
being glued to my freaking phone.
Becerra watches have a distinct looking 

165
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,253
quality field that will take your look 
up a level if you're bored with Cookie 

166
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,240
Cutter Department Store watches,
you'll like.

167
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,103
Vincero is bold and daring designs and 
the quality is top notch in Sheros 

168
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,170
philosophy is to focus on impeccable 
craftsmanship.

169
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,590
Their product isn't about a bunch of 
fancy specs are slick marketing.

170
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,100
It's all about creating watches with 
meticulous attention to detail.

171
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,550
And a commitment to quality.
And the best part is you don't even have

172
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,410
to be rolling in dough to get one like 
this.

173
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,520
All this elegance is available to you at
an accessible price,

174
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,000
but don't take it for me.
Let the numbers speak for themselves.

175
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,480
