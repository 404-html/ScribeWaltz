4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,733
Yep.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,350
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,910
I'm your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.
This week's artifact is spirited away,

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,803
the award winning masterpiece from 
legendary animator and confirmed Silver 

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,190
Fox.
How yells a media Xochi.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,970
The story opens on a 10 year old human 
female named Shahir row and her parental

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,804
units as they get lost in the woods,
and if a human is lost in the woods and 

11
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,260
no one is around to hear it,
does it register as a sentient life?

12
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,094
Form point is these schmoes accidentally
stumbled their way into a magical land 

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,820
filled with delicious food.
That's by none.

14
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,654
Get a million free.
The parents start stuffing it down 

15
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,954
there,
gullets and lose their kosher status 

16
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:01,720
faster than you can say,
Oh,

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,383
oh God.
To hero does what any child would do in 

18
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,400
this situation and abandons her porky 
parents to go beef up her resume.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,160
Could you give me a job please,
please.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,003
I just want to,

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,163
after much haranguing a wrinkly,
old cronut named you Baba hires to hero 

22
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:21,634
to work in her bath house,
but changes her name to send as a show 

23
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:25,234
of bad faith and so made this dreamboat 
Haku warned said not to forget her real 

24
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,114
name like he did,
or else it can cause a real headache at 

25
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,324
the DMV.
You name a stink spirit arrives at the 

26
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:42,460
bath house around mid same time.
It usually arrives for me.

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,600
Send cleans them successfully and to 
thank her,

28
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,600
the Spirit bestows upon her the greatest
gift of all,

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,720
a little Turd and fused with IPECAC 
elsewhere.

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,870
A guy named no face pays for a bunch of 
food with gold,

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,810
which is the very foundation of a 
transactional ecosystem,

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,760
so it doesn't really seem like much of a
problem.

33
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,690
Why is everyone screaming soon?
Who gets poisoned and Oh,

34
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,524
by the way,
he's also a dragon now sometimes saying 

35
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,610
gives them part of that Turd to crunch 
on,

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,360
which makes him bark off a shiny little 
egg mcmuffin while she's at it.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,193
She gives the rest of the term to know 
face just to see how much barfing is 

38
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:21,040
allowed in a pg movie.
Turns out it's a metric ass load.

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,760
Next,
send visit Zinni.

40
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,410
You,
Barbara,

41
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,560
his twin sister,
to give back the mcguffin.

42
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:30,010
Haikus stole during the breakfast rush,
an informed sen that it was her love for

43
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:34,780
her coup that broke some cursor,
another which is gross because sin is 10

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,673
and Huck,
who's gotta be at least 18 backoff 

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,423
creep.
There are plenty of other fish in the 

46
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,900
sea monster.
Later,

47
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,763
completely unprompted.
Send remembers a time she fell into the 

48
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,560
[inaudible] River,
which they arbitrarily decide means that

49
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:51,100
huck who is short for Co Haku and he's a
river spirit,

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,970
so he's like a thousand and their 
relationship is even more inappropriate.

51
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,010
Shame on you.
Japan.

52
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,290
You Baba gives sen last pop quiz where 
she has to identify your parents,

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,120
but sen wasn't born yesterday.

54
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,920
I mean technically,
yes,

55
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,843
sin was born yesterday,
but Shahir wasn't none of these gigs or 

56
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:15,181
my mom or dad and now that she's a hero,
again,

57
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
it's time to grab her rehumanized 
parents and blow this popsicle store.

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,473
Spirited away is a coming of age story 
and the tradition of classics like Tim 

59
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,070
Burton's Alice in Wonderland and James 
Franco's the wizard of Oz,

60
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,210
which similarly portray a young girl 
transported to a strange place where she

61
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,044
asked to do a bunch of stuff at the 
start of the film to hero is naive and 

62
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,110
inexperienced with a dash of timid and 
whiny,

63
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,480
sprinkled in for good measure.
Look to euro.

64
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,453
There's your new school.
It is only by solving problems and 

65
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,814
helping those in need that you hero 
gains the self reliance and empathy 

66
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,834
needed to terrorize a giant baby.
Underneath this story of renewal and 

67
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:00,370
vomiting lurks a cautionary tale of 
greed and overconsumption,

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,413
particularly as it relates to post war 
Japan after the shall we say messy end 

69
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,790
of World War Two,
Japan experienced an economic boom,

70
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,683
no offense,
non taken that correlated with a 

71
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:16,270
cultural shift toward capitalism and 
away from traditional values.

72
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,223
The spirit realm takes the form of an 
old amusement park styled after the 

73
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,560
Meiji period of the late 19th and early 
20th century,

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,870
which are two of my all time favorite 
centuries discarded trines.

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,713
Adorn the hillside symbolizing the 
relegation of cultural history in favor 

76
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,310
of more modern pursuits like leisure and
interdimensional slipstreams.

77
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,110
In this economically driven environment,
overconsumption has dire consequences,

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,320
much like the type you might find in a 
prenup to heroes,

79
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,930
parents snarfed down food from the 
spirit realm,

80
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:50,200
despite its obviously suspicious lack of
vegetables.

81
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,580
Don't worry,
you've got Daddy,

82
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,590
he's got credit cards and cash.
In return.

83
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,424
They are transformed into pigs which are
commonly used on earth as a critical 

84
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,324
symbol of capitalists,
cultures that would bring about the 

85
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:07,040
eradication of humankind.
That's all folks.

86
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,950
The bathhouse furnace has also shaped 
like a pig constantly gobbling resources

87
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,010
just to give guests a slightly more 
temperate bubble bath.

88
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,740
When no face shows up overflowing with 
gold,

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,633
you Baba and our workers milk that 
proverbial horse for every last fluid 

90
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,980
ounce,
but as the staff showers,

91
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,760
no face and access,
he can't help but shower them in stomach

92
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,594
acid.
The film expresses hope that modern 

93
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,054
Japan can find a balance between 
economic prosperity and spiritual 

94
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,374
heritage.
There as much emphasis on remembering 

95
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,280
one's name.
If you completely forget it,

96
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,180
you'll never find your way home and the 
identity of one's parents look hard.

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,190
It's up to you to remember which ones 
they are,

98
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,550
and even though I forget both of those 
things on a daily basis,

99
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:49,384
mom,
they are important in forging a 

100
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,940
connection to one's ancestry.
The message deepens when we consider the

101
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:58,100
context of the film prior to making 
spirited away.

102
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:58,934
Director Hio Miyazaki was considering 
passing the torch to the next wave of 

103
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,044
artists at studio Ghibli,
though he reconsidered when he 

104
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,630
remembered he was the man.
Furthermore,

105
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:12,230
at the time when many animated films 
were visualized using computers,

106
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,123
spirited away was drawn using an 
elaborate system of levers and pulleys 

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,233
and it story conveys the hope that 
future generations will flourish and 

108
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:24,170
progress while at the same time 
respecting the history of the art form,

109
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,560
whatever that was.
For earthlink.

110

again,
like many youtubers,

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,333
