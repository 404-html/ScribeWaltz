1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,220
Hey wisecracks and share it again.
You might've noticed that we have a soft

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,320
spot for cynical,
irreverent,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,243
and even nihilist comedy,
but we've recently been wondering is 

4
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:15,444
there anything on the other side of our 
current cynicism is comedy based and 

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,810
earnestness and genuine human emotion 
still possible?

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,840
To answer this question,
we're turning to our friend Bo Burnham,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,823
a comedian who might have cracked the 
code for how to embrace all the 

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,290
intellectual goodness of postmodern 
irony

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,260
while

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,540
offering something with a real human 
core.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,433
Could we get the house lights up for a 
second and could you put the lights on 

12
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:43,580
stage?
Let the artifice fade away.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,443
Now we're all the same like a candy bar 
that has a hard shell of cultural 

14
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:47,894
cynicism on the outside,
but a warm hug from your favorite aunt 

15
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,510
on the inside.
Even though Burnham is still baby faced,

16
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,690
his work has actually gone through a few
distinct stages.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,673
While his earliest work incorporates 
postmodern cynicism and ironic 

18
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:01,034
detachment,
I adopted a child from overseas to 

19
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:04,724
rescue him from child labor factories 
and on his very first birthday we went 

20
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:13,541
to build a bear workshop is more recent 
work.

21
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:17,180
Not only exposes the meaningless core of
contemporary life,

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,103
but also attempts to offer a corrective 
with introspection and a search for 

23
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:22,394
happiness.
On a scale from one to zero are you 

24
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:26,930
happy?

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,853
Burnham might be the rare comedic figure
able to offer salvation from the empty 

26
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,160
cultural wasteland.
That is our modern world.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,173
So welcome to this wisecrack condition 
on the philosophy of Bo Burnham and I 

28
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,314
guess spoilers part one.
How did we get here to understand why 

29
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,710
Burnham represents such an important 
shift in comedy?

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,250
We first need to see how comedy arrived 
at its postmodern era,

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,383
and more importantly,
what the hell is even meant by 

32
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:52,964
postmodernism.
This phrase become so amorphous that it 

33
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,090
can be used to describe everything from 
cars to Scottish beer,

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,133
but a more helpful understanding can be 
found in the work of Fredrick Jamison 

35
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,820
who's work describes postmodernism as 
the cultural logic of late capitalism,

36
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,923
which means that each new form of 
economic life creates a related form of 

37
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,540
cultural life.
For example,

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,493
when you're a poor college student,
your economic situation dictates a 

39
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,940
cultural life of cheap beers.

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,803
Movies in a dorm room and paying for 
dollar cheesy rollups with your laundry 

41
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:26,210
quarters.
When you graduate and get a job,

42
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,103
you're drinking a locally made IPA 
paying $20 for a movie ticket and using 

43
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,930
your debit card for a cheesy Gordita 
crunch.

44
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,183
A few years later,
you sell your app flush finder that 

45
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:36,854
gives you a map of the cleanest public 
toilets near you and you'll be drinking 

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,860
aged whiskey sitting court side and 
sending your scared assistant,

47
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:45,890
Adrian,
to grab you a crunchwrap Supreme Combo.

48
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,203
Each economic stage in your life leads 
to a new cultural stage and 

49
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,074
postmodernism is the cultural logic of 
the current stage of economic 

50
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:56,600
development,
which jamison calls late capitalism.

51
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,000
Now let's see how Jamison's ideas can 
help us understand me shifting trends in

52
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,834
American comedy over the past 70 years.
We can do this with a three step 

53
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:05,854
process.
Economic Culture leads to popular 

54
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,430
culture,
which leads to comedy.

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,150
Let's start in the fifties America is in
a post war boom.

56
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,020
The Gi bill has led to record numbers of
college grads and homeowners.

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,943
It's easy to get a middle class job and 
Cuba is just a quaint island of resorts 

58
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,204
and cocktails.
This era's popular culture is all about 

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,110
optimism and enjoyment.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing up here?
I thought you were downstairs.

61
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,550
Backs and chocolate all.
They kicked me out of there fast.

62
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,520
I kept pinching them to see what kind 
they were

63
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,030
and their comedy sensibility can be seen
in someone like Jack Benny.

64
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,013
Congratulation bars,
why you would just shine when appeal of 

65
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:42,474
a day data

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,620
by the mid sixties the boom time is 
over.

67
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,220
The Cold War has people on edge and the 
Vietnam war is on the horizon.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,233
There were protests,
naked hippies and someone gave the 

69
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,450
Beatles.
LSD.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,493
The counterculture had snuck into the 
popular culture and Lenny Bruce is on 

71
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,410
trial for obscenities while George 
Carlin is listing

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,853
and

73
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,123
by the 80s Reagan had promised endless 
economic growth and we've got cable TV 

74
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,674
to keep us company.
24 seven new media creates the 

75
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,720
opportunity for a new read of superstar 
and wild.

76
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,880
Michael Jackson sold out arenas with his
music.

77
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,790
Eddie Murphy did the same with comedy,
but let's be honest,

78
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,340
the most important thing is how fly they
look and red leather jacket.

79
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,203
It's in the nineties Comedians like 
Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Romano had gone 

80
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:28,210
from successful standups to television 
stars.

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,193
How many was more mainstream than ever?
MTV giant cell phones and economic 

82
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:35,470
growth,
a bounded and all the while.

83
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,610
How many rode this wave with a new 
optimism and increasingly goofy spirit.

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
We're not worthy,

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,770
but just like Taco bell's Nacho fries,
good things can't last forever.

86
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,380
And by the dawn of the 21st century,
the.com

87
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:51,214
bubble had burst.
Limp Biscuit was popular and nine 11 

88
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,394
left the country.
Wondering if anything could be funny 

89
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:56,764
anymore.

90
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,010
Can we be funny?
Why start now?

91
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,190
As the aughts rolled on,
things didn't get much better.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,750
The 2008 financial crisis was the worst 
since the great depression and the weird

93
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,500
scrubs reboot left us all wondering if 
nothing was sacred anymore.

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,700
Part too

95
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,533
comedy as cultural cynicism,
the political and economic cynicism of 

96
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:24,100
the oughts led to a new form of cultural
cynicism in the media

97
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,290
design.
And I never was alone.

98
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,860
If you don't go squeeze on her day.

99
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,973
Wow.
Mostly known for its groundbreaking 

100
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,200
character prison.
Mike.

101
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,790
The worst thing about prison was the was
the dementors.

102
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,624
They were flying all over the place and 
it was scary and then they'd come down 

103
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,820
and they suck the soul out of your body 
and it height.

104
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,813
The office showed us the mundane and 
often meaningless existence of the 

105
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:47,324
American worker and the rest of his 
division was slowly taken over by 

106
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,910
reality shows that we're all completely 
fake,

107
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,690
but nobody seemed to care.
One of the most recent shifts that helps

108
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,524
us.
The effect of late capitalism on comedy 

109
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,230
is what we're calling the adult swim 
phenomenon.

110
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,453
What started as a way for cartoon 
network to get stoners to watch their 

111
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:09,580
channel while eating double decker tacos
has since become the home of some of the

112
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,414
weirdest,
most absurd and most intentionally 

113
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:14,950
cringeworthy comedy to hit the American 
Airways.

114
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,470
Tim and Eric,
awesome show,

115
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,304
great job,
showed us a surreal and absurdist 

116
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,020
version of the upside down.
[inaudible].

117
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,843
It's nice to put a good Eric Andre 
ironically occupied the space of the 

118
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,754
late night host,
the show how meaningless the late night 

119
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:35,340
model had become while using interviews 
with c list celebrities.

120
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,920
The highlight,
the vapid nature of it,

121
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,170
contemporary fame.
Mr Neighbors House has recently shown us

122
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,004
what happens when Mr.
Rogers has put through the postmodern 

123
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,770
cynicism filter.

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,033
Uh,
no matter what the color and when you 

125
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,120
lie,
you hurt your brother.

126
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,223
And of course our friends rick and morty
give us an animated response to the 

127
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,614
classic philosophical question.
What if back to the future was an r 

128
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,870
rated movie involving the multiverse 
nihilism.

129
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,850
Nobody gets it.
Nothing you think matters,

130
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:06,150
matters and lots of brown liquor.
Many of these shows weren't even funny,

131
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:06,984
at least in the traditional sense,
whereas the 90s and early aughts used 

132
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:12,930
canned laughter to tell our lizard 
brains when to laugh.

133
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,830
Ah,

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,793
Eric Andre used canned laughter to 
create an uncomfortable moment for all 

135
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,454
involved

136
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,983
to hear about this.

137
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,640
Maybe Andre just wants to push the 
limits of what we'll watch or maybe he's

138
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,880
asking you if there's even such a thing 
as authentic comedy anymore.

139
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,740
We only know one thing's for sure about.

140
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,773
You've got to eat.
The lettuce is just straight up eat the 

141
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,064
lettuce

142
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,810
at the same time that adult swim is 
blossoming.

143
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,733
Occupy Wall Street is taking over the 
streets of Manhattan and young people 

144
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,340
around the world are questioning 
economic and political institutions in a

145
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,680
way that would make the mug covered.
Hippies proud,

146
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
but I'm like their forefathers Linnaean 
and George who used political cynicism 

147
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,550
to infuse their comedy with an urgency 
for truth.

148
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,680
Got No steel industry left,
can educate our young people,

149
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,514
can't get healthcare to our old people,
but we can bomb the shit out of your 

150
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,560
country.

151
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,393
Three.
All right.

152
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,493
Don't swim generation.
Let this cynicism go from a rallying 

153
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:11,704
cry.
This cynicism for cynicism safe rather 

154
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:14,884
than a response to a troubled world.
This cynicism denied the existence of 

155
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,710
real meaning or truth in the first 
place.

156
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,720
Just say summit again,
it don't matter,

157
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,380
but not of this.
Madison

158
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,910
do return to the fourth meal of cultural
theory.

159
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:27,744
Fredrick Jamison.
This cynical comedy is a perfect 

160
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,310
exemplification of postmodernism,
the same cultural form repeats,

161
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,260
but this time with iron ore to 
paraphrase marks first as Johnny Carson,

162
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,223
ben is Eric Andre eating his own vomit.
Cynicism and irony led to a brand of 

163
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:51,041
comedy in which truth meaning and human 
earnestness are just useless relics from

164
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,140
the era of canned laughter and Pesky New
York mothers.

165
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,530
So are we now in this postmodern 
feedback loop of meaninglessness?

166
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,100
Maybe not.
But to find out we have to return to our

167
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,450
friend Beau.
Nope.

168
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,980
The other one,
she's pretty,

169
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,240
but no,
no.

170
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,950
Not The obamas.
Portuguese water dog.

171
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,470
The comedian,
lanky white guy in his twenties yes.

172
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,730
Finally Jesus.

173
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,950
Three from irony to sincerity in Bo 
Burnham,

174
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,960
our guys.
Before we keep going,

175
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,330
real charity here for a minute.
As you guys know,

176
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:24,610
we sometimes talk about pretty heavy 
subjects.

177
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,160
Cynicism.
Nihilism avoids a meaning.

178
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,440
You know the drill.
But these topics can be,

179
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,380
to put it bluntly,
a bumper.

180
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,480
So that's why I want to talk about this 
video sponsored for better help,

181
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,900
a counseling service that allows you to 
connect with licensed therapists on your

182
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:38,980
computer,
tablet,

183
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:41,680
or mobile phone.
I actually tried the service myself,

184
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,514
so wait till the end of the video to 
hear more about my experience until 

185
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,690
then,
go to better help.com/wise

186
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,450
crack to get started.
And now back to Bo.

187
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,583
Bo Burnham is an interesting case.
As much of his early work was shaped by 

188
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,230
the influence of Dutch absurdist haunts,
tailwind,

189
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,780
where have you been in jail?
For what?

190
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,800
Right?
I had no idea

191
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,043
and embodied eighth attach irony which 
exemplified the tenants of postmodern 

192
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:09,910
comedy.

193
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,570
Jesus can walk on water.
Can you swim on land

194
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,660
because there is no fixed standard of 
truth or meaning.

195
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,750
Burnham used comedy to point the 
audience to the slack.

196
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,400
Jesus

197
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,630
wasn't the Messiah.
Get back on the herons again.

198
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,590
I'm on fire with the head of past those 
holy nights stuff.

199
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,110
Holy mother,
right

200
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,393
in his recent work,
Burnham pushes back against the 

201
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,094
emptiness of postmodernism in an attempt
to find genuine meaning in things like 

202
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,504
love and happiness.
We could say that rather than returning 

203
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,470
back to ava.
Modern perspective,

204
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,333
Burnham pushes through postmodernism to 
arrive at a post postmodern perspective 

205
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,223
where the death of traditional meaning 
is an opportunity for the creation of 

206
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,944
new meanings.
We can see his progression by 

207
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,494
considering his three specials as three 
distinct stages in his comedic 

208
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,020
development is first special words,
words,

209
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,630
words explores the death of art and 
comedy.

210
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,853
The followup,
what goes a step further and operates 

211
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,460
under the principle that meaning itself 
is dead and his most recent special make

212
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:12,810
happy works through the death of meaning
in an attempt to see if real meaning and

213
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:16,650
happiness are still possible from the 
opening minutes of words,

214
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:17,340
words,
words,

215
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,550
Burnham aims to show the audience the 
facade of entertainment.

216
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,810
It's all an illusion and I'm wearing may
God I'm wearing may got bay Guy Burnham

217
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,880
art is dead because it's really just a 
means for something else.

218
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,743
So people think you're funny how they 
get those people's mind and true to the 

219
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,044
logic of late capitalism.
The real purpose of art is simply 

220
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,254
creating opportunities for making more 
money and presumably eating Nacho 

221
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:41,251
cheese,
Doritos,

222
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,084
locos,
supreme's whenever you want and when he 

223
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,740
speculates on what the forefathers of 
counter cultural comedy would think.

224
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,480
His conclusion isn't pretty.

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,510
We're rolling in dough out car.
Lana rose eight is gray.

226
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,310
His array by pointing

227
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,340
to the death of art,
Burnham shows how comedy has just become

228
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,174
a way for charming narcissist,
make as much money as they can with no 

229
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,480
imperative for authenticity or truth.
If words,

230
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,314
words,
words is Burnham's eulogy for the death 

231
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,384
of art.
He goes a step further in what and 

232
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:12,100
mourns the death of truth and meaning as
such,

233
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,410
artist alive,
not like Israel.

234
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,070
And he's aware that in the context of 
people's actual problems,

235
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,410
laughter isn't the medicine we've been 
sold.

236
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,553
That's it last towards the key to 
everything is the way to solve all the 

237
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:26,240
sadness in the world.
I mean,

238
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,520
not for the people that are actually 
stabbed,

239
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,750
but the people like us that got to deal 
with them all the time.

240
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,793
Unlike the adult swim comedians burden 
doesn't just embrace the chaos that 

241
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,054
comes from the depth of meaning.
He's asking what it means for us when 

242
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:38,400
meaning dies.

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,110
None of you are go,
hey,

244
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,790
and asking whether or not the creation 
of meaning is possible.

245
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,090
Maybe the life on earth could be have.

246
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,823
He has no conclusive answer in what,
and he lets us sit in that space of not 

247
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:55,720
knowing.

248
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,553
Oh cool.

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,033
What is the point where he starts to 
consider that comedy devoid of the 

250
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:11,160
aspirations of any higher meeting is 
just an equine atm.

251
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,053
By the way,
I'll stop beating this dead horse when 

252
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,900
it stops spinning.
Now

253
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,000
make happy represents Burnham's attempt 
to use comedy not just for criticism,

254
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,953
but as a vehicle to search for meaning 
and he makes clear early on at his 

255
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,600
comedy is not a mode of escapism.

256
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,613
You are here because you want to laugh 
and you want to forget about your 

257
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,360
problems,
but I cannot allow it.

258
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,873
You should not mind.
You should not forget about your 

259
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,014
problems.

260
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,953
Instead of escape,
Burnham tries to use comedy as an 

261
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:47,564
occasion for the audience.
Jukes truly encountered their problems 

262
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,983
and maybe themselves in the process and 
less you underestimate Burnham's desire 

263
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,460
to make you think about some real shit.

264
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:55,830
Okay.

265
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,663
The world is not funny.
12% of the world's population does not 

266
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,471
have access to clean drinking water.
The world is not funny guy fee area owns

267
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:09,990
two functioning restaurants

268
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,323
and while he has some facts wrong,
verdomme doesn't want to use culture as 

269
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:15,014
a way to escape reality,
which is one of Jamison's worries about 

270
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:18,584
postmodernism that it removes the 
imperative for us to be critical about 

271
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:22,424
the world around us.
Like a server who lets you know that 

272
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:25,784
he's upselling you on donkey sauce,
not because it's good but because it 

273
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:29,084
will make him money.
Burnham lets us peek behind the 

274
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,460
comedians curtain entertainers,
they are lying and they are manipulating

275
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:35,294
you.
It's not all harsh reality for Burnham 

276
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:40,400
though as he thinks the move past 
cynicism has some upside.

277
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,580
We all deserve even on the days when we 
are in our past cause we all suck.

278
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,550
Love can make a suck less.
Paul deserve love.

279
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,190
It's the very best part of being an I 
would know.

280
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:06,630
I just turned 20

281
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,523
yeah.

282
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,210
And by adding that last line,
he undercuts his own point,

283
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,163
showing us a position that straddles the
line between naive optimism and ironic 

284
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:17,454
cynicism.
The show ends with Bo Burnham's take on 

285
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:23,070
a Kanye West concert circuit.
2016 cannot say much

286
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,520
New York cannot see much.

287
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,230
While it might start off with jokes,

288
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,883
listen to the people,
I'm sure 90% of the complaint letters 

289
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,830
you get are about the width of your 
cans.

290
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:47,660
Just make them wider.

291
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,590
He peppers this confession with some 
more vulnerable moment.

292
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,200
Don't go to the gym because I'm self 
conscious about my body,

293
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,570
but I'm self conscious about my body 
cause that don't go to the gym

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,540
and he closes out with what seems like a
genuine wish for his audience.

295
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,830
Thank you.
Good night.

296
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,843
I hope you're happy

297
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,463
with make happy.
Burnham hearkens back to the socratic 

298
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,440
tendencies from comedians in a previous 
era,

299
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,363
much like the gadfly of Athens himself,
Burnham is urging his audience to truly 

300
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,684
acknowledge their problems,
that unhappiness as the unexamined life 

301
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,120
is not worth living.
And like aristotle,

302
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,300
his final words imply that happiness 
might be possible,

303
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,283
but we have to work at it.
What's most interesting is that Burnham 

304
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:33,590
doesn't simply reject postmodern comedy 
for the sake of something new.

305
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,620
Instead,
he pushes postmodern comedy to its limit

306
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,513
to see what's on the other side.
And over the course of these three 

307
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,024
specials,
we see him transition from irony to 

308
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,574
cynicism to earnestness or from the 
death of art to the depth of meaning to 

309
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,120
the possibility of meaningful art after 
the death of me.

310
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,620
Art For comedy as a cure for despair,
or is Rick Sanchez right now,

311
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:58,930
you might be wondering,
so what even burden thinks we should try

312
00:16:58,931 --> 00:16:59,680
to be happy?

313
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,513
We live in a world where goodness and 
truth seem increasingly illusory and in 

314
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:08,200
a world where Nacho fries aren't even on
most Taco bell man use anymore.

315
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,810
Is it even worth moving past postmodern 
cynicism?

316
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,913
One telling factor is that Burnham isn't
the only one trying to inject a post 

317
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:16,414
postmodern sincerity back into comedy.
A great example is the most critically 

318
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:22,660
successful comedy film of 2017 the big 
sick,

319
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,130
which coincidentally stars Burnham as a 
comedian obsessed with success and while

320
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:31,480
it's a genuinely funny movie,
it explores family success and love with

321
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:34,960
a sincerity,
not common in comedy films and it's safe

322
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:38,460
to guests that the inclusion of Ray 
Romano isn't a coincidence as receive.

323
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,303
The cranky set calmed out of the 
nineties portraying a complicated and 

324
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:45,520
compassionate human being.
We've also seen this shift from irony to

325
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:50,130
sincerity in shows like Nathan for you.
I mean the ones I do get

326
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,660
you guys in a part of me is envious that
you know I don't have someone in my life

327
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,520
that is unless close with

328
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,283
and infusing absurdity with a story 
about genuine adult friendship in 

329
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,310
Detroit and even one of the darkest 
shows out there.

330
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:11,030
Bojack horseman explores the possibility
of finding real meaning.

331
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,893
It takes a long time to realize how 
truly miserable you are and even longer 

332
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,760
to see that it doesn't have to be that 
way.

333
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,450
Only after you give up everything can 
you begin to find a way to be happy.

334
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,893
While Fredrick Jamison has yet to offer 
an analysis of the way in which comedy 

335
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:29,450
can cure the cultural illness of 
postmodernism.

336
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,403
It might just be the case that Burnham's
work is telling us something about what 

337
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:36,110
will happen on the other side of late 
capitalism.

338
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,230
Either way,
the crunchwrap supreme is here to stay.

339
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,950
So maybe there are eternal truths that 
we can all still believe in.

340
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,083
But Hey,
crunchwrap supreme is can't solve all 

341
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,300
your problems.
Trust me,

342
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:48,134
I've tried seriously though,
there are real ways to help with life 

343
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:51,350
struggles.

344
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,240
So this video is sponsored by better 
help.

345
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,660
I actually tried out the service myself.
I spoke with a certified therapist named

346
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:57,494
Jennifer and it was really pleasant.
It was as good or better than any 

347
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:01,484
therapist I've seen in real life.
So with better helping them communicate 

348
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,140
with the counselor via message,
live chat,

349
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,910
phone,
or video conferencing,

350
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,070
you can do therapy,
whether you're in the pool,

351
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:13,190
when you're walking your dog,
whatever is most productive for you.

352
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,730
So what I liked the most about better 
health is that it's accessible.

353
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,803
People who normally wouldn't seek out 
therapy or don't even know how to go 

354
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,880
about getting it,
can get access quickly.

355
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,900
It's also convenient.
Oftentimes when people do decide to seek

356
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:27,734
therapy,
it's only because they're at a really 

357
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,580
low point in their life.
They're already desperate.

358
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,533
And when you're in that state of mind,
the last thing you want to do is jump 

359
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:37,430
through insurance hoops,
knowing who's in and out of your network

360
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,473
or who don't go through all that,
paying exorbitant amounts or having to 

361
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,490
deal with stacks of paperwork.
That's not the case.

362
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,324
With better help,
people are matched within 24 hours and 

363
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:49,850
it's completely confidential.
So better help gets rid of the stigma.

364
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,803
It gets rid of the hassle,
and it makes therapy accessible and 

365
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:54,380
easy.
So look,

366
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,243
if you're like me and you think you 
could benefit from speaking to someone 

367
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,064
on a regular basis,

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,113
thanks for watching

371

peace.
