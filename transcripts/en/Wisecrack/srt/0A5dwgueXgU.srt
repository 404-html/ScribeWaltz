1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,583
Well,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,770
I mean,
just justice for me.

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,690
I mean,
one of the reasons I love Shakespeare is

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,920
that justice,
you know,

5
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:12,754
I could say back to you at that level of
abstraction will justice is about 

6
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:18,600
fundamental fairness.
Justice is about equality,

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,640
know among people who are similarly 
situated,

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,503
justices about due process of law.
But I think precisely why I'm driven to 

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,124
Shakespeare is because I don't think the
conversation really helps anybody at 

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,164
that level of generality.
So we really need to think about 

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,660
particular stories in particular case 
studies in particular mythologies.

12
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,670
And one of the regrets that I have 
about,

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,210
uh,
the otherwise wonderful nature of the,

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,283
of American diversity is that our 
heterogeneity means that we have very 

15
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:54,760
few common mythologies left to us.
So what I'm trying to do,

16
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,594
and Shakespeare is to try and say in the
same way that I would say to a law 

17
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,094
school class about a case,
but I want to make this more available 

18
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,720
to people who haven't gone to law school
and don't want to go to law school.

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,220
You know,
let's read the merchant,

20
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,054
read the merchant of Venice to me with 
together with me against measure for 

21
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:10,300
measure.
You know,

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,133
and the merchant of Venice is really 
about a law that a society that takes 

23
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:16,204
law too seriously,
like takes a letter of the law too 

24
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,300
seriously,
which is to say,

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,420
Charlotte says,
I want my pound of flesh.

26
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,254
You know,
and the court of Venice is open to all 

27
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,070
comers.
It's a cosmopolitan society.

28
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:27,904
It's a market society.
So it interprets that contract really 

29
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,030
strictly.
And in fact,

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,930
this is in the play,
which is to say because this is a market

31
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,840
open to all comers,
people would lose faith in the law if we

32
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:40,060
didn't interpret all contracts really 
strictly.

33
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:40,894
And so therefore sharla because entitled
to Antonio's pound of flesh and nobody 

34
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,390
wants to live in that society,
right?

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,673
On the other hand,
it can't be that when portia says the 

36
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:53,380
quality of mercy is not strained to drop
the pith of gentle rain from having upon

37
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,020
the place beneath and she has this great
encomium to mercy,

38
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,460
that mercy is what it's all about and 
that all we need as an answer to this is

39
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:01,294
to be merciful to each other because 
what real mercy would mean would really 

40
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:08,350
be something that would strike at the 
very heart of law.

41
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,900
And that's measure for measure.
The Duke at the beginning of measure for

42
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,640
measure,
just so people know,

43
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,610
since this is a less familiar play,
he's a duke of Vienna.

44
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,300
He has law,
the law fall into utter disrepair.

45
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:23,870
So he just hasn't enforced the law and 
so lawlessness is sweeping the land.

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,733
Then my favorite line is the baby beats 
a nurse like this is a world out of 

47
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,121
joint.
You know,

48
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:28,954
hierarchy has been disrupted and so he 
essentially leaves and leaves the 

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,050
leaves,
a really strict a deputy and as place to

50
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:38,080
enforce the law,
but the deputy himself ends up violating

51
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,510
a law and then the dude comes in and 
restores order.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,793
But at the very end.
But Duke like issues all these pardons 

53
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,050
to everybody who's broken the law all 
over again.

54
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:47,884
So at the end of the play,
or we're no better off than we were at 

55
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,284
the beginning.

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,423
So both the merchant and metric or 
measure or describe worlds to us in 

57
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:57,250
which neither of us would want to live 
that no,

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,910
no one would want to live in.
Because you know,

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,730
the merchant of Venice doesn't have 
enough mercy measure for measure has too

60
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,700
much marcy and no law.
So what is the answer to that?

61
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,580
I don't think that there's any easy 
answer that says,

62
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,100
you know,
I'm going to titrate,

63
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,070
you know,
mercy and,

64
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:12,904
and the letter of the law if such a way 
that we're going to have the perfect 

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,180
balance and it's like,
ah,

66
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,850
you know,
two to one ratio of letter of the law to

67
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,920
mercy.
Like that's never going to be the case.

68
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,740
It's going to hatch that actually be on 
the ground and with contacts.

69
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,130
But I think that looking at our common 
mythologies,

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,143
it's going to help us understand that 
and the reason that we have these 

71
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:35,491
stories so that we understand that as 
justice Oliver Wendell Holmes on sad and

72
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,140
you know,
the life of the law is not logic.

73
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,330
It's experience and it's experience of 
these stories.

74
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,600
It's a fine grained every day,
you know,

75
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,640
muddy,
murky,

76
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,680
you know,
uh,

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,513
a nature of,
of life itself that we somehow have to 

78
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,330
make sense of.
And the answer is not going to be,

79
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,343
well,
we should have the strict letter of the 

80
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,510
law,
or we should have,

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,340
you know,
overflowing mercy.

82
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
Because neither of those is going to end
up in a society in which we want to 

83
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,844
live.
But I'm trying to find that middle 

84
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,944
space.
We're not going to be able to do that 

85
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,330
through any kind of scientific formula.
It's not an algorithm.

86
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,164
It's not Algebra.
We're going to actually have to talk 

87
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,340
about culture.
And that's what I'm trying to do.
