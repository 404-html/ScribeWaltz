1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,043
Crack Jerod here today.
We've got a favorite among the wise 

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:07,224
crack staff,
the tale of humans picked for 

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,354
experimental augmentations to find out 
what happens when people stop being 

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:16,160
polite,
start getting real at first.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,780
Look,
the DSX franchise franchises,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,570
they kind of wet dream for info wars 
enthusiasts.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,643
Murderous clocks by the Illuminati are 
carried out by world governments while 

8
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:28,280
the player traverses fema camps and 
discovers the truth behind fake news,

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,563
but unlike certain performance artists,
dance sexist forays into conspiracy 

10
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:37,610
serve as more than just a means to sell 
dietary.

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:38,444
So the game reveals how paranoia informs
more of societies decisions than we'd 

12
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,090
like to admit and serves as a cautionary
tale for the dangers of technology comp.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,820
But there are no gay frogs.
Sorry,

14
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:50,654
Internet,
I don't like him putting chemicals in 

15
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:54,510
the water that turned the frigging frogs
gay.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,090
Welcome to this wise crack condition on 
Dsx.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,390
This video was made in collaboration 
with our buddy Joseph over at real life.

18
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,220
Lord,
you can learn more about his channel and

19
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,470
check out his related video at the end 
of this one.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,090
And if you're here visiting from real 
life,

21
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,280
Laura,
welcome and be sure to subscribe,

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,783
spoilers ahead for all the games.
The day sx series asks two basic 

23
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:14,890
questions.
One,

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,903
what would it mean for society if we 
could all become cyborgs with Jack's 

25
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:23,440
arms and to what does the premise that 
every conspiracy theory is true mean for

26
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:24,274
the real world?
And before we get into the ethics of 

27
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:29,800
skull guns and neural enhancement,
we have to put on our tinfoil hats.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,950
There is no shortage of conspiracy 
theories in the day,

29
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:33,784
a sex series in the original game,
a splinter organization of the 

30
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,234
Illuminati called majestic 12,
produces a nan night virus called the 

31
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:43,060
gray debt as a means to consolidate 
their power.

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,373
Why contain it?
Let it spill over into the schools and 

33
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,450
churches let the bodies pile up in the 
streets.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,840
In the end,
they'll beg us to save them as producers

35
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,940
of the only cure for the disease as 
well.

36
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,750
They can easily manipulate others while 
capitalizing off the disorder.

37
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,750
Wrought by it.
The great death is a manmade virus.

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,380
Everyone up to the president is at 
UNESCO's mercy,

39
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,160
as long as you Naccho controls the 
supply.

40
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:06,994
If Ambrosia in the cul invisible war,
the illuminati controls two of the most 

41
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,283
influential groups in the world,
the World Trade Organization and the 

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,050
order a religious organization opposed 
to the WTO.

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,170
By managing the conflict between these 
two factions,

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
the Illuminati is better able to control
the world.

45
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,580
Finally,
in the new prequels,

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,610
we see the illuminati attempt to limit 
human augmentation.

47
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,720
Since having a bunch of engineered super
humans running around isn't really great

48
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,750
for the whole compliant population thing
that they're going for.

49
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,883
If there's one thread that has run 
through the sometimes vastly different 

50
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:41,050
games in the series,
it's paranoia.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,750
Not only is there the conspiracy,
paranoia,

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,500
but also paranoia directed at so called 
outsiders and others.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,610
Why don't you much greater going?
Ultimately,

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,503
the Games are fueled,
the profound power of paranoia and that 

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,550
it doesn't matter whether the paranoia 
points to the truth or not.

56
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,623
Paranoia,
independent of truth shapes our actions 

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,550
and ultimately society.
Early on in the game.

58
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,820
Gunter,
your sidebar,

59
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,663
coworker,
who yearns for a skull gun is convinced 

60
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,170
that the facility staff is replacing 
orange soda in the vending machines with

61
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:15,280
lemon lime in an inane and unlikely 
conspiracy against him.

62
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,720
The machine will not make a mistake.
It's still maintenance,

63
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:20,130
man.
He knows I like.

64
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,063
Oh,
so you think the staff has some kind of 

65
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,480
plot?
Yes,

66
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:25,620
to do that on purpose,

67
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,180
except 20 years later in the game 
sequel,

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,200
it's revealed in the ruins of gunters 
office that he was right all along,

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,113
denying people their natural born rights
to choose their own artificially 

70
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,350
flavored destiny's.
Like I said,

71
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,360
there's just something wrong with that 
machine.

72
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,093
Probably some sort of office politics as
if to foreshadow the entire rest of the 

73
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:45,204
game.
This idea of just because you're 

74
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:47,574
paranoid doesn't mean they're not.
After you becomes the main ethos of Dsx 

75
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,523
in mankind.
Divided colleague Spin Wild Tales of 

76
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,700
getting hacked,
which turn out to be true.

77
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,450
We have a lot of enemies.
The people who bombed the train station,

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,490
you don't think they'd love to know 
where we are.

79
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,510
You need to help me figure out who's 
looking into us and make them stop other

80
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,344
suspect,
a police coverup of a bombing there 

81
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,540
probably destroying all the evidence 
there is right now.

82
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,320
Also true and I was right.
Even you,

83
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:20,590
the player must navigate who to trust 
your old time boss David Saraf,

84
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,533
pilot Alex Vega,
your new boss that Interpol who may or 

85
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:27,420
may not be working for the Illuminati at
every point.

86
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,283
The game undermined your trust in others
as you hack into the emails of your 

87
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:31,734
coworkers installed listening devices 
and get ambushed by enemies who were 

88
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,990
tipped off about your arrival hell.

89
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,853
Even the suicide cult that wants to 
merge with computers and mankind 

90
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,680
divided,
turn out to only be a few years off from

91
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,860
being right.
JC Denton manages to do this with Helios

92
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:51,390
at the end of the original day of sex.
So why does sex make a point to validate

93
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,253
even the most far fetched ideas?
It could be in part a greater message 

94
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,130
about how paranoia works in the real 
world.

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,550
People who are paranoid often don't 
invent things out of nothing,

96
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,593
but instead take interpretive leaps when
over analyzing the data presented to 

97
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:07,494
them or if you thought he was high 
strung before the attack only made him 

98
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,250
more manic.
He's making connections.

99
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,800
No one else sees some that may not be 
there,

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,753
but rather than dismissing this kind of 
paranoia as mere delusion dsx runs with 

101
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:22,020
it is a man rambling in the sewers about
mind control,

102
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,610
right?
Part of it,

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,240
the hive mind inside the gate,
I questioned what holds us together were

104
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,770
unequivocally yes.

105
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,880
You mean your attempt to control people,
amplifying your hypnotic techniques with

106
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,270
some kind of social enhancer.
This brings me to one of mankind.

107
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,470
Divided is most important commentaries.
Tracing the relationship between general

108
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,304
paranoia and racial paranoia.
Augmented humans as a metaphor for 

109
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:51,774
racial discrimination isn't exactly 
subtle as a mechanically augmented 

110
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,543
Interpol agent.
You face harassments from the citizens 

111
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,930
of Prague and literally live on the 
wrong side of the tracks.

112
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,793
As you witnessed routine police 
brutality inflicted on your augmented 

113
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,724
peers.
Do you understand what fuels this 

114
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,214
discrimination?
We're turning to cigar enthusiast and 

115
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,884
psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan,
or at least with these liberty and 

116
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:18,210
Dumbledore,
writes about him and forced flyboys.

117
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,153
Jack are paranoid.
Theories often reflect our own 

118
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
identities,
ideologies and shortcomings rather than 

119
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,660
the actual state of things.
For instance,

120
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,340
he cites a story from Lacan regarding a 
jealous husband who even ever right that

121
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:34,580
his wife is sleeping around,
is still pathologically jealous.

122
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,623
If she stays late at work,
he'll pathologically assume she's being 

123
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,880
unfaithful.
If she starts having male friends.

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,670
Same thing as a development of this 
logic.

125
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,260
Gisha excites Nazi antisemitism.
If a Jewish person committed a crime,

126
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,273
it could very well be true,
but the fixation on Jewish crime spoke 

127
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,444
more to German paranoia about foreigners
in pure blood then to any kind of real 

128
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,490
issue.
In other words,

129
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,120
crime is just crime until a Jewish 
person commits it,

130
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,223
then it becomes part of the Grand Jewish
conspiracy to ruin the German race and 

131
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,184
so on.
You can look at conspiracy theories in 

132
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,004
the same light are most laws made in 
closed door meetings with lobbyists and 

133
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,084
interest groups probably.
Are they all part of a secret cult to 

134
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,470
serve their reptilian overlords?
Probably not.

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,753
Likewise,
in Dsx and he augmentation advocates 

136
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,053
filter all information through the Lens 
that augmented people are dangerous and 

137
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:31,500
possibly an affront to nature,
talking heads use terrorism,

138
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,393
or the catastrophic August incident 
where augmented people were hacked into 

139
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,294
going into a homicidal rage to justify 
apartheid style oppression of augmented 

140
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:42,990
people.
This discrimination then fuels even more

141
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:45,330
violence,
thus making augmented paranoia,

142
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,100
a self fulfilling prophecy.

143
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,690
Everyone looking over their shoulder 
terrified.

144
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,660
We're going to attack them again.
Somebody probably will treat people like

145
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,730
animals long enough.
They'll start acting like animals.

146
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,890
The power of paranoia to shape public 
discourse can be seen in Dsx.

147
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,993
Eliza [inaudible],
defense of news coverage meant to 

148
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:03,394
spread.
Fear toward the augmented is just 

149
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,740
reporting the news.

150
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,500
Let Ms Dot Kim.
News outlets are simply reporting on the

151
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,520
current situation

152
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,420
and even if the reporting is true for 
guest points out,

153
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,640
you can choose to only show my shoe,
which is very ugly,

154
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,803
but that is only a small part of me.
News outlets only care about a small 

155
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,180
part.
I'm sorry Ms Dot Dossen,

156
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,870
but you can't trust the news outlets if 
you want to understand the world.

157
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,820
The Org debate in the news functions on 
two levels,

158
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,953
one as aquin points out to only report 
on the negative aspects of augmented 

159
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:39,660
existence and to to use augmented 
violence as a validation for your larger

160
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:43,410
ideological project in this case be 
human restoration act,

161
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,550
a bill that would either remove or 
severely limit to the augmentations that

162
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,384
people have of course on like real world
news Pikus is news coverage is dictated 

163
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:56,160
by the Illuminati.
I was engineered

164
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,993
to monitor communications and data 
streets to find out what people are 

165
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,330
talking about and make sure it's being 
discussed to correctly

166
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,473
as they cover up evidence of water 
contamination in Prague and falsely 

167
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,060
report that a flight was taken down by 
an augmented terrorist

168
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,563
in yet another terror attack.
Two hundred and 51 passenger airlines 

169
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,374
flight

170
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,100
rather than the truth that the plane was
shot down by a military installation

171
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,070
plane went down because of whatever the 
military was doing there.

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,580
Not because of some augmented passenger 
like bike is.

173
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,140
Clamps

174
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,650
are these paranoia is don't tell us much
about reality itself,

175
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:35,680
but instead shine light on the reality 
behind the paranoia for Dsx,

176
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,623
that reality is a carefully constructed 
story meant to combat augmentation so 

177
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:40,914
that the Illuminati can better control 
the population for their pro business 

178
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,710
purposes,
but is there an even deeper truth to the

179
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,544
way paranoia operates in the game?
While the real world is not governed by 

180
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,800
the Illuminati?
Depending on who you ask,

181
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,220
one could argue that it is governed by 
the basic principle,

182
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,510
which the Illuminati in Dsx understands 
this state of exception.

183
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,610
According to philosophers,
Giorgio Agamben,

184
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,473
there is a hidden law that why's behind 
both modern liberal democracies and the 

185
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:09,060
totalitarian regimes of the 20th 
century.

186
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,043
The exception.
We've talked about this before in our 

187
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,550
walking dead and attack on titan videos,
but they,

188
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,950
uh,
sex is exploration is wholly unique.

189
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,810
Accumbent builds off the theory of 
sometimes,

190
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,330
right,
but always an asshole.

191
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,163
Carl Schmitt who argued that would 
define sovereignty is not that the law 

192
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:26,454
per se,
but the ability to suspend the law to 

193
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,724
make the exception for Gambon.
This suspension of law marks all 

194
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,894
totalitarian regimes.
The concentration camps were a physical 

195
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:39,630
space where normal law was suspended for
more than a decade,

196
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,733
a state of exception,
whereas our modern liberal democracies 

197
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,693
aren't building death camps.
The state of exception isn't always 

198
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,874
imminent component of modern governance,
usually in the name of a national 

199
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:55,170
emergency or an existential threat.
Governments today regularly create zones

200
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:59,490
of exception where the law no longer 
applies or creates classes of people who

201
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,324
are outside the normal functioning of 
the law and thus exist in this kind of 

202
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,003
exceptional state.
Prisoners of war protected by 

203
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:08,154
international law get replaced by enemy 
combatants who gets sent to get mo were 

204
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,960
regular us.
Law doesn't apply in DSX.

205
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,803
This logic seems implicit to the 
conspiracy theory favorite fema in the 

206
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,430
name of managing emergencies.

207
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,480
They build detention camps for political
prisoners and implement martial law,

208
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,703
be segregated.
Udall at complex of mankind divided 

209
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:32,280
presents a similar zone of exception in 
resembles a mix of apartheid era,

210
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,050
South Africa,
Jewish ghettos,

211
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,771
Becau,
luned,

212
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:39,660
wall city and Modern Day refugee camps.
The player witnesses horrifying examples

213
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,494
of police brutality and augmented people
who live in constant fear all in the 

214
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:47,190
name of security,
and when tensions boiled over,

215
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,280
such as when an augmented rights 
activist is assassinated,

216
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,233
the civil unrest justifies even more if 
the illuminati wants to spread chaos 

217
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,393
like staging a train station bombing,
it's because they understand that chaos 

218
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:05,230
breeds people desiring security,
and when people desire security,

219
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,730
it's all the easier to suspend basic 
rights and exert more authority.

220
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,450
While we may think of chaos and order as
opposites,

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,990
the game understands how they can become
entangled in the modern world.

222
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,973
Chaos is manufactured in discreet ways 
in order for oppressive powers to 

223
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,210
maintain control,
but besides illuminating,

224
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,044
no pun intended,
how security operates even in our own 

225
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,740
non illuminati world.

226
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,753
They esx also uses the state of 
exception as just one of its many 

227
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:34,444
criticisms of transhumanism.
Transhumanism is the idea that 

228
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:42,040
technology will help us overcome human 
limitations like disease and scarcity,

229
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,080
prosthetics,
contact lenses,

230
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:44,914
and in vitro fertilization or just 
stepping stones in the greater 

231
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,543
transhumans project.
Transhumanism is baked into the very 

232
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,400
idea of human augmentation asx.
However,

233
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,050
rather than blindly celebrating,
transhumanism,

234
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,103
it portends everything that could 
possibly go wrong as the human race 

235
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:06,671
unlock human potential and mastery over 
nature that technology becomes available

236
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:11,180
to individuals and groups and can 
potentially fall into the wrong hands.

237
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,283
Even augmentation technology developed 
by the Illuminati soon escaped their 

238
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,800
control as private corporations entered 
the fray,

239
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,300
this forced the Illuminati to change 
their stance and oppose augmentation.

240
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,800
No,
by going public with this discovery,

241
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:27,634
Saraf is forcing our hand.
Invisible war starts with a terrorist 

242
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,630
attack that turns everything into a grey
goose and in mankind divided,

243
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:35,464
there exists an underground market for 
augmentations which is likely assisting 

244
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,050
both the good guys and bad guys.

245
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,243
As such,
the destructive potential of technology 

246
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,400
often necessitates permanent states of 
emergencies and martial law.

247
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,010
That accumbens work was critical of 
basically,

248
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:51,844
as technology gets to epic,
the government will have little problem 

249
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,180
convincing you that your rights have to 
be suspended for the good of everyone,

250
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,493
but it's not just the state of exception
that's a problem for the transhumanist 

251
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,330
future.
JBS Haldane,

252
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,193
one of the earliest thinkers of 
transhumanism warrant in 1924 that 

253
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,214
society would have a hard time keeping 
pace with the progress of technology in 

254
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:13,834
data lists or science in the future.
He wrote that the tendency of applied 

255
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:17,734
science is to magnify injustices until 
they become to intolerable to be born 

256
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,653
and the average man who all of the 
profits and poets could not move turns 

257
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,570
at last and extinguishes the evil at its
source.

258
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,990
In other words,
technology will make social injustice is

259
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,050
worse until societal anger will boil 
over into a full on rage in Dsx.

260
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,913
More often than not,
the dangers of technology are thrust 

261
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:41,944
upon the poor.
Those who are augmented need to 

262
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:44,614
constantly take neuropazine to stop 
their body from rejecting their 

263
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:47,944
augmentations,
but those with means can much more 

264
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,853
easily obtained the drug.
And in the case of manual laborers or 

265
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:56,380
soldiers who are augmented by their 
employers,

266
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,273
let me guess.
Most of the laborers will mentored with 

267
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,970
heavy duty industrial rings or the 
government sends you what they want,

268
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,193
do what they want,
replace parts of you whenever and 

269
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,374
however they want.
They exist in a precarious state where 

270
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,024
the maintenance of their augmentations 
is contingent on them maintaining the 

271
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,624
same or similar job rather than 
suggesting that human evolution through 

272
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:18,854
technology will level the playing field 
they isx suggests societal forces will 

273
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,384
make inequality worse and just as 
Haldane warns that this tension will 

274
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,810
cause people to rise up and root out 
evil at its source.

275
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,733
We see two competing movements in the 
game focused on the same thing in human 

276
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,920
revolution.
The humanity front uses violence to stop

277
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,710
the spread of augmentation and and 
mankind divided.

278
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,770
A legal solution exists in the human 
restoration act.

279
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,933
Meanwhile,
augmented people slowly entertained 

280
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:46,574
violence as a political strategy and 
tell the assassination of Taylor's 

281
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,360
rucker results in full on riot,
you know,

282
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,250
would have rutgers death is going to 
spread,

283
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,320
don't you?
When that happens,

284
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,670
the head of state police assures me 
Golem city will become a war zone.

285
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,613
Another idea trumpeted by some 
transhumanists is the idea of the 

286
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,960
singularity.
A point at which artificial intelligence

287
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:11,340
will explode the rate of technological 
development in the original dsx.

288
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,203
Bob Page hopes to create his own twisted
version of this by merging with the 

289
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,913
Helios Ai,
but instead the player is given the 

290
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:19,254
option to merge with Helio's to rule the
posts singularity world as a benevolent 

291
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,334
dictator,

292
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,633
trenches.

293
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,750
The game doesn't necessarily put any 
kind of judgment on this,

294
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:35,584
but the solution still feels a bit icky 
and afterwards when the merger between 

295
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,890
JC tensen and Helio's doesn't go as 
planned,

296
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,843
the technological infrastructure of the 
world collapses and chaos envelops the 

297
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:47,224
world gc that's going black.
The message is not so subtly found in 

298
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:58,030
the name of the two ais that usher in 
the singularity Daedalus and ICARUS

299
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,250
and barriers between her falling.

300
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,043
According to legend Daedalus was an 
ancient Greek inventor who invented 

301
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,404
manmade flight.
His son ICARUS plummets to his death 

302
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,870
after using the invention to fly too 
close to the sun.

303
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,033
The collapse can be viewed in this light
as a too fast and too reckless 

304
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:25,630
technological development that comes 
metaphorically crashing down.

305
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,000
Just don't know what you're doing.
Everything when they lost everything,

306
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,570
the world would fall to pieces.
Haldane believed.

307
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,600
The only hope is for morality to keep 
pace with science dsx explores the moral

308
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:39,984
questions inherent in our technology 
driven future isn't right for companies 

309
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,890
to augment their workers.
Instead of asking this beforehand,

310
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,320
the prevailing logic and the game is 
augment.

311
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,154
First ask questions later.
What about installing chips to limit a 

312
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:57,300
person's augmentation?
If they say go on a homicidal rage.

313
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,070
A brief debate may happen on TV while 
legislators are trying to pass the bill,

314
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,600
but companies have already developed the
technology before anyone decides whether

315
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,610
this technology should even exist.

316
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,310
Technology first,
morality later,

317
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,323
and that's a recipe for disaster in a 
way to Nsx is forcing us to ask these 

318
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,694
questions.
We can find tailless rucker offering a 

319
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,254
robust criticism of government's 
limiting the abilities of the augmented 

320
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,190
and even though we're a bit far from 
Jack's arms,

321
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,060
the Games can make us question the 
technological progress in our own world.

322
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,950
Usually I would get a lot of press in 
for a knee,

323
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,253
but given that these social media has 
radically redefined how we engage with 

324
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:41,664
the world and we've only begun to ask 
questions about its influenced after we 

325
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:48,120
suspect it's done something egregiously 
wrong.

326
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,253
So what do you think wise crack will 
arch like dsx convinced us to take a 

327
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:56,040
critical look at technology before we 
decided to universally adopted?

328
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Or are we diving headfirst into a 
nightmare?

329
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,413
And one more question.
In a world where people trying to 

330
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,500
succeed in places like Texas,
Catalonia,

331
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,990
and even California seems to be getting 
more popular.

332
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,750
The original dsx seems weirdly 
prophetic.

333
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,763
There's the national secessionist forces
and Texas is troubled attempt to leave 

334
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:16,260
the union,
but how would that actually work?

335
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,520
Our friend Joseph at real life floor has
a great video exploring the hypothetical

336
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:23,100
secession of Texas where he and I are 
from.

337
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,173
So go check out his video by clicking 
here and be sure to tell them that wise 

338
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,290
crack sent you.
And as always,

339
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,640
guys,
thanks for watching.

340
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,713
Peace.
