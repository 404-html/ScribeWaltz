00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,130
A wise crack,
jared here today,

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:05,964
we're diving deep into the world of 
metal gear solid now because doing a 

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:12,360
full scale philosophy of would be an 
arsenal gear scale undertaking.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,610
We decided to focus on something else 
today,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,460
the enigmatic nature of its Creator 
Studio Jima.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,030
Not only will we be talking about the 
underlying themes of the games,

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,923
but also how Kajima has inserted himself
into these games in an unprecedented 

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,020
way.
Nowadays.

9
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:28,854
It's not uncommon to have a small indie 
game tell a personal story from its 

10
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,424
creator,
but it is uncommon to see that happen 

11
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:37,380
with a big budget cinematic thriller 
like metal gear solid.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,730
These games aren't just a collection of 
stories about solid snake in big boss.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,750
They're also about co Gima and his place
in video gaming at the time.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,030
In a funny way,
life imitates art.

15
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:48,864
Here you have a narrative arc going from
upbeat poppy spy adventures to 

16
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,824
Nihilistic,
Anti American cynicism as coaching his 

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,420
relationship with Konami Sour,
but now with those shackles fried,

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,250
he's off to make whatever weird thing 
this is,

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,190
but before Koji,
Miss Games became gut punching,

20
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,450
self critical studies.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,373
They started off as a Kurt Russell,
rip off welcome to this wise crack 

22
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:14,160
edition on co Gima and metal gear solid,
but before we get into it,

23
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,780
we wanted to give a shout out to our 
sponsor,

24
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,614
audible,
who enabled us to finally dive into the 

25
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,804
crazy world of metal gear.
We're going to get into this in a hot 

26
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:21,504
second,
but Winco Jima created the world with 

27
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:23,454
metal gear solid.
It was actually inspired by Richard 

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,820
Dawkins,
the selfish gene.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,800
I call him Dickie Dee because we're 
tight.

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,813
You can learn about the very ideas that 
inspired him to Yoko Gina's work while 

31
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:32,994
still playing his games,
but I'll get more into that later to 

32
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,090

Thanks to audible.
Oh,

43
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,130
and watch out.
Major spoilers ahead.

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,480
The seventies were a decade when 
visionary American directors were making

45
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,170
masterpiece after masterpiece with 
directors getting top billing,

46
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,120
discreet,
artistically mature works.

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,133
A whole generation of kids grew up 
wanting to make their mark on the world 

48
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,290
through movies and video.
Kojima was right there among them,

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,950
but as fate would have it,
gaming would be the outlet for Cucina to

50
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,784
express his cinematic ambitions.
The first two metal gear games are full 

51
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:32,070
of references to coaching was favorite 
action movies.

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,000
The whole concept of self gameplay was 
inspired by these sneaking scenes of the

53
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,710
great escape.
One of the bosses,

54
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,810
a duo of unstoppable cyborgs.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,470
We're straight up terminators originally
called Arnold's and snakes.

56
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,304
Codename was ripped directly from 
Russell's character in escape from New 

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,843
York.
I'm not a snake who gene was earlier 

58
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,104
works.
Police knots and snatcher were 

59
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,510
respectively animate up Japanese takes 
on lethal weapon and blade runner,

60
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,613
but it was the advent of three d gaming 
in the late nineties that gave Kajima a 

61
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,600
truly cinematic canvas to work with.
Suddenly,

62
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,420
video games needed cinematography and 
performances,

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,570
so Kajima made snake even more of a Kurt
Russell rip off.

64
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,643
My name is Pliska.
The solid snake of metal gear solid was 

65
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,484
so close to snake skin that years later 
the film's rights holders actually 

66
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,670
wanted to sue until John Carpenter 
stopped them,

67
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,923
but beyond his obvious love for movies,
you can also see a kind of optimism and 

68
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,830
metal gear solid what I understand,
but why metal gear,

69
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,723
the nuclear age ended with the turn of 
the millennium writing a spy adventure 

70
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,324
in the late nineties,
shortly after the Cold War has snake 

71
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,480
saying things like this.

72
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,423
Russia today has enough.
They're struggling between freedom and 

73
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:43,290
order,
and with that struggle,

74
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,420
a new spirit of nationalism is born

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,620
given the enormous economic decline 
Russia faced after the Cold War.

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
Snakes,
words might sound naive today,

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,913
but they fit right into an upbeat 
feeling of peace and prosperity for the 

78
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,330
West.
Complete with a villain,

79
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,860
frustrated over a world,
gone soft off,

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,040
throwing the launch this weapon and get 
a billion dollars.

81
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,290
We'll be able to bring chaos and back to
this world soft.

82
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,030
This is metal gear solid at its most 
optimistic,

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,020
but it's all downhill from here.
In December of 1999,

84
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,883
the Ria filed a lawsuit against napster.
Cocina thought the idea of the US 

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,353
government controlling how people shared
music was great fodder for his paranoid 

86
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:25,824
cyberpunk spy fiction,
so in metal gear solid to our villains 

87
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,514
are the patriots,
a secret network of conspirators who 

88
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:35,400
have a chokehold on the US government,
the media and the minds of the people.

89
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,600
This country is shaped and controlled as
the Patriot seat fit.

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,760
The people are shown what they want to 
believe,

91
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,863
what you call it.
Government is actually a weld stage 

92
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,890
production aimed at satisfying the 
public,

93
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,950
which includes you,
the player

94
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,903
colonel.
I just remembered something that I've 

95
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,880
never met you in person,
not once.

96
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,580
If you fell for all the bait and switch 
tricks packed into games writing now,

97
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,720
yes,
in the sql games,

98
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,554
it's revealed that the patriots are 
actually robot ai satellites made for 

99
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,060
comic relief sidekicks from the Prequel 
Games,

100
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:08,690
but importantly they're based on 
something much more real.

101
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,613
We are formless.
We are very disciplined and morality 

102
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:13,844
that Americans invoke so often.
The Patriots are the concept of memes 

103
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,104
personified.

104
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,163
We started with genetic engineering and 
in the end we succeeded in digitizing 

105
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,420
life itself,
but there are

106
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,700
are things not covered by genetic 
information.

107
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,890
What do you mean?
Human Memories ID culture,

108
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,330
history,
metal gear,

109
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:36,370
solid one references Richard Dawkins' 
book,

110
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,263
the selfish gene in which he coined the 
term the beams means our cultural ideas 

111
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:45,490
that replicate and spread from people to
people similar to gene's tunes,

112
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:49,750
catchphrases and ideas are all means 
also means or means,

113
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,850
so as the language you're thinking in 
right now,

114
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,310
which means the perspective that you 
understand reality,

115
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,144
which is all made out of meat.
The are these psychological 

116
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,880
homogenization of culture.
They aren't globalization,

117
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,943
they or why other countries are wearing 
America's blue jeans and listening to 

118
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,310
their poppies,
Perko Jima.

119
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,144
They are yet Japanese game developer can
succeed at making very Japanese games 

120
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,360
for Americans based on American action 
movies.

121
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,040
All the movie references that Cocina 
included in these games are memes as the

122
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,874
games themselves,
the end of metal gear solid to has all 

123
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,904
the characters reflecting on the meaning
of life and it's said to reflect co 

124
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:29,510
Gina's anxieties about his own work as 
well.

125
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,640
Life isn't just about passing on your 
genes.

126
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,930
We can leave behind much more than just 
DNA through speech and music,

127
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,970
literature and movies.
What we've seen heard,

128
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,990
felt anger,
joy and sorrow.

129
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,190
These are the things I will pass on.

130
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,130
Countless interviews at the time 
revealed that metal gear,

131
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:59,910
solid tube was supposed to be coaching 
was last metal gear games before handing

132
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:03,540
it off to a new team.
In a sense go Jima was trying to pass on

133
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,374
his mean,

134
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,700
yeah,
well listen,

135
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,920
what I do,
I'm going to quit,

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,590
but was so unsatisfied with what they 
were cooking up for.

137
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:22,520
Mail gear solid three that he decided to
step back in and directed himself.

138
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,593
So in true [inaudible] fashion metal 
gear solid three is full of even more 

139
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:30,320
Kajima means the game takes place on 
[inaudible] first birthday,

140
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,490
August 24th,
19,

141
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:34,100
64,
and includes multiple movie references,

142
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,250
especially early sixties.
James Bond and hitchcock flicks.

143
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,340
Go was personal.
Philosophies are once again present,

144
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:44,720
but this time there's a decidedly more 
nihilistic slant from a character called

145
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:45,830
the boss.
Light is,

146
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,520
but a farewell gift from the darkness to
those on their way to die.

147
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,090
The bosses message of breaking down the 
world's political barriers

148
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,060
is there such a thing as an absolute 
timeless anymore.

149
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,360
There is no such thing and never has 
been,

150
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,000
and the reason is that our enemies are 
human beings like us.

151
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,760
There can only be our enemies in 
relative terms.

152
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,780
The world must be made whole

153
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,050
is gradually warped and perverted until 
it turns our hero into a villain.

154
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,153
The big boss of the earlier two d games 
who was warmongering for the sake of 

155
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,260
giving mercenaries,
a purpose in life.

156
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,890
It's a bleak view of the world that 
comes to fruition in metal gear.

157
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:32,270
Solid four ever respect that face in 
your mirror.

158
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,553
The first world becomes obsessed with 
war and the third world is their 

159
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,520
battlefield.
In the Games universe,

160
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,120
wars had become cold financial 
strategies in real life,

161
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,280
so had metal gear,
solid games under Konami.

162
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,533
This was the second time code.
Jima was roped into continuing metal 

163
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,920
gear solid after wanting to back out 
with attempts at franchises like zone of

164
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:52,754
the vendors and Bach tie failing to 
capture mainstream attention the same 

165
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,394
way.
So metal gear solid four was explicitly 

166
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,320
designed to end it all for real.
This time,

167
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,333
the gameplay acquiesced to the first 
person shooter modes and fully 

168
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,304
controllable cameras demanded by 
reviewers and the story gave in to the 

169
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,310
fans most burning questions while the 
cutscenes fulfilled comas,

170
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,790
lifelong desire to make films,
no other metal gear,

171
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,803
maybe even no other game has cut scenes 
that go on as long as the and the grand 

172
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,070
irony of it all is that this is both be 
closest and furthest.

173
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,950
Kajima came to making actual movies.
Metal gear,

174
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:29,060
solid four had plenty of live action 
video put Kajima,

175
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,933
didn't direct write or produce it.
These intro commercials were outsourced 

176
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,100
to an American studio.
Meanwhile,

177
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:35,934
questions from metal gear,
solid food that were never meant to be 

178
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,500
answered are answered to the Wilderness 
and results

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,720
on site.
Destroy Katie with a nuclear strike.

180
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,130
The Patriots network will be mine and 
then I'll build my haven.

181
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,413
A melodramatic costume party.
Story ends with the hero and villain 

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,833
beating the dead horse of their conflict
for 20 minutes and solid snake is now 

183
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,483
old snake.
There's definitely an undercurrent of 

184
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,154
self hatred running through this game,
especially with the knowledge that Koji 

185
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,364
human wanted to run away from its 
development and originally planned in 

186
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,454
ending where were arrested and executed,
which came from the fact that fans sent 

187
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:16,050
him death threats if it wasn't made,
but despite could was protests and metal

188
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:19,320
gear solid four is conclusive narrative.
He still couldn't get out.

189
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,393
Konami was demanding more and more of 
these games and they were to be made by 

190
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:24,294
no one else.
A rocky relationship between Kajima and 

191
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:27,804
his employer started boiling up in 2009 
with him joking in an interview that if 

192
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,364
fans Richard Right the CEO of Konami and
tell him that [inaudible] doesn't have 

193
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,040
to make metal gear anymore,
it might be easier for him to stop.

194
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,313
Go.
Jean was only nonmetal gear project 

195
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:44,400
after four was a minor production role 
in Castlevania lords of shadow,

196
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,340
but then it was right back to snake and 
now metal.

197
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,174
Here's plot had to become more 
convoluted and provocative to keep up 

198
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,690
with its own standard.

199
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,380
Obviously they're bringing in state of 
the art,

200
00:10:55,381 --> 00:11:00,270
weaponry and equipment by the shipload.
Where'd they get that kind of cash?

201
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,080
I fear maybe involved the CIA.

202
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,830
Peace walkers fiction tested the idea of
nuclear deterrence.

203
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,840
Wait,
he's launching a new.

204
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,910
To prove that is perfect.
Current works.

205
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,750
His words to prove that if someone 
attacks us,

206
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,063
we will strike back a situation that 
mirrored the mutually assured 

207
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,084
destruction of coaching was creative 
work against Konami's tight control of 

208
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:29,910
it.
This t rated portable entry still had to

209
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:30,744
explore the gritty.
He'll turn of big boss and the route 

210
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:36,090
code human took was her boss to idolize 
Che Guevara.

211
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,043
Jay never managed to numb himself pain.
That's why people loved him and why he 

212
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:43,750
died.

213
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,530
A figure whose popularity to his western
audience is polarizing to say the least.

214
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,813
Four years later,
the Anti American sentiments of the 

215
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,274
series new protagonists are taken the 
extreme ground zeroes to explain to him 

216
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,853
a very thinly veiled Guantanamo Bay were
supporting characters are subjected to 

217
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:04,270
horrific sexual humiliation and torture.
A year after that,

218
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,133
metal gear solid five,
the phantom pain pain's the US 

219
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,774
intelligence community as an out of 
control evil conducting experiments on 

220
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,500
third world refugees while also rubbing 
the u.

221
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:17,260
s is known as hard in their real life 
support the Afghan Mujahideen.

222
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
Four years ago,
the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

223
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,920
Muslims are fighting back with Western 
support

224
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,680
and desire president mobile.
Second set go.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're not selling them US military 
hardware.

226
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,480
Would you ever read about Napster in 
ninth,

227
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,323
99 to make the Patriots and it's just as
likely that news breaking out about Apu 

228
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:43,940
Grip Guantanamo and Edward Snowden 
inspired this new version of an American

229
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:44,774
illuminati cipher.
These stories were being told in spite 

230
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
of and perhaps in response to coach 
edema,

231
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,883
not exactly having a great working 
relationship with neo liberal corporate 

232
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:55,934
capitalism.
When rumors of a rivalry between Cocina 

233
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,963
and Konami came to light,
so did stories of his bosses actively 

234
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:02,654
sabotaging his projects.
Eventually shipping metal gear solid 

235
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:07,280
five in two parts with an incomplete 
ending,

236
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,130
believe it or not,
the first edition of Moby Dick,

237
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,993
a novel frequently referenced,
and metal gear solid five was also 

238
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:14,534
released without it's ending chapter.
The parallels between moby Dick and 

239
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:18,284
metal gear solid five are rampant venom 
code named Ahab is an amputee naval 

240
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:27,284
captain hell bent on revenge.
Who commands a vessel called the peak 

241
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,550
was just like the Aa happened in the 
book,

242
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,350
but

243
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,183
this connection to the male of the 
classic is also reflected by the 

244
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:39,004
players' response to the game.
Like Ahab the player is relentlessly 

245
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,264
chasing after a white whale.
They'll never best a feeling of 

246
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,340
completeness at the end of finishing 
this game.

247
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,503
It's a feeling so pervasive that entire 
fan communities have sprung up over 

248
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:55,300
refusing to believe that the game is 
over.

249
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,220
Similarly,
in Melville's book,

250
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:58,054
the eponymous white whale is seen as a 
representation of being a hollowness of 

251
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,134
the universe,
the thought of annihilation or the 

252
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:07,960
meaningless prize of a life spent 
seeking meaning in metal gear.

253
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:12,370
Solid five players can seek meaning by 
completing a story arc that ends halfway

254
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:15,040
through with the second half of the 
story asking,

255
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,903
but never answering the question of what
happens after a hero defeats the 

256
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:19,744
villain.
Players can instead seek meaning in the 

257
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,114
Games multiplayer missions which 
developed a kind of whaling economy of 

258
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:28,330
their own or they can find meaning by 
going for a completion score.

259
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,080
That of course has them fruitlessly 
chasing after rare animals,

260
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,273
but no matter how you play,
no matter which ending you go for the 

261
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,350
Games,
tone remains melancholy,

262
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,370
lonely,
and a anti climactic.

263
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,533
There's no epic final boss fight.
Each ending is intended to leave the 

264
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,514
player feeling unfulfilled and wanting 
the player feels a literal phantom pain 

265
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,973
which leads us in our own opinion,
at least to believe that could Jima was 

266
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,853
his own,
Captain Ahab with his own obsession to 

267
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,064
defy the typically cold corporate 
tradition of game design and create his 

268
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,503
own art on his own terms if he's been 
wanting to get crazy and make something 

269
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,364
different than at least his story can 
have a happy ending for now because 

270
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:13,820
Norman reedus waking up naked on the 
beach after giving birth to a magic goes

271
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:18,410
baby is a premise of a story where we 
truly don't know what to expect and also

272
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:21,200
something that could have never been 
done under the thumb of Konami.

273
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,393
So is this life imitating art or were 
these just insightful predictions bound 

274
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,050
to come true?
Either way,

275
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,150
color us stoke to checkout.
Death stranding.

276
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,700
Kajima is truly one of those 
interesting.

277
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,990
Ah,
tours in gaming.

278
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,850
And as always,
thanks for watching guys.

279
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,890
Piece.
Thanks for watching.

280
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:37,724
Wise crack in case you missed it.
We recently released a video on the 

281
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,770
philosophy of assassin's creed road 
remastered.

282
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,650
We got the chance to go back and play 
the game with fresh eyes,

283
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,160
which left us wondering if we'd been 
playing the bad guys all along.

284
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,203
Be sure to check out that video by
