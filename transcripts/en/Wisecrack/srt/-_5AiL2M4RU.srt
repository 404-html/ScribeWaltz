1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,883
Well,
there are unusual in the sense that 

2
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:14,730
statistically it's unusual could say 
it's just,

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,160
it's a statistical at Ollie's 
statistical fluke.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,503
There's no reason to think that 
earthquakes are occurring any more 

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,820
frequently now than they had then they 
occurred last year or 10 years ago,

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,790
or 10 years into the future.
There's no reason to believe that,

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,980
and it has nothing to do with global 
warming.

8
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,840
Believe me,
that's a question that we often get.

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,263
Well,
one of the things we've learned 

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,570
seismologists is that earthquakes that 
occurred anytime at any place,

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,404
in fact,
they don't even have to occur at plate 

12
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,230
boundaries for that matter.
But that's,

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,250
that's a whole other topic.
Uh,

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,110
but along some of the major plate 
boundaries,

15
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:45,944
like,
uh,

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,350
that Pacific northwest,
uh,

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,480
we have evidence of pastor earthquakes.
And that's actually isn't,

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,393
it's an interesting thing.
Obviously we didn't have instruments 

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,450
going back more than about a hundred 
years or so.

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,280
So we don't have an instrumental record,
but we have a record from a newspaper,

21
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,870
old newspapers,
for example.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,160
We have a record from some old mission 
records,

23
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:07,994
particularly in California,
Spanish mission records and elsewhere 

24
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,060
throughout the western hemisphere.
Uh,

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,990
we have very long,
uh,

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,730
historical records in China and Japan 
and,

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,060
and in parts of Asia where people have 
been writing things down for quite a few

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,241
centuries.
Uh,

29
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:24,074
but in some places we simply don't have 
that written record and we have to rely 

30
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,760
again on proxies.
Um,

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,680
there are a couple of things we can do 
in a place like a California or Seattle,

32
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,180
the state,
California first.

33
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,790
Uh,
one thing we can do when we have a fault

34
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:42,440
like the San Andreas is to actually dig 
a trench across that fault.

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,470
And when we trench across false like 
that,

36
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,660
and you do that,
trenching it at different places,

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,020
you can actually see in the disturbed 
soil the record of pastor earthquakes,

38
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,810
it may occur every hundred and 50 or 200
or three or 400 years,

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,123
uh,
but with very good carbon dating or 

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,880
other geological techniques,
uh,

41
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,160
we can get a good sense of what that 
history is.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,340
And by doing that trenching at various 
places along the fault,

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,320
we can even get a,
an estimate of the,

44
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,154
of the size of the rupture,
which gives us a way to calculate the 

45
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:14,954
magnitude that then allows us to 
calculate the repeat intervals safe for 

46
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,364
these very large earthquakes in Seattle,
or I should say more generally off the 

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,033
coast of British Columbia,
Washington and Oregon going down into 

48
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:28,844
northern California.
That's a different kind of a plate 

49
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,630
boundary.
It's what we call a subduction zone.

50
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,464
It's a convergent boundary.
It creates the cascades and the 

51
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:36,480
volcanoes,
uh,

52
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,960
so we can't trench it.
Um,

53
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,823
but what we can do is look at the 
history of uplift on the coast because 

54
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,090
every time an earthquake occurs,
uh,

55
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,983
the upper plate,
which is basically the coast of 

56
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,390
Washington and Oregon and northern 
California gets bumped up a little bit.

57
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,000
And by looking at the sediment Terry 
record,

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,860
actually sometimes it can go down as 
well,

59
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,280
but you know,
looking the sediment Terry record,

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,080
uh,
looking at the way,

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,820
say even trees or drowned by encroaching
water or lifted above the water table or

62
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,654
so on.

63
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,790
A,
you can get a sense of the history,

64
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,040
uh,
uh,

65
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,933
people who look at things like tree 
rings or the history of corals 

66
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,930
[inaudible] corals up there now.
But if we go elsewhere around the world,

67
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,340
we see that,
uh,

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,210
these are all proxies for past big 
earthquakes.

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,090
There's another proxy which,
um,

70
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,780
in particular for the Pacific Northwest 
Works and that is,

71
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,123
uh,
earthquakes along that boundary have a 

72
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:39,220
tendency to generate.
It's an army and when it's an Ami,

73
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:42,820
propagates mu or moves across the 
Pacific Ocean,

74
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,490
particularly a big one,
when it hits islands,

75
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,140
uh,
on the other side of the Pacific,

76
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,230
uh,
you get what's called tsunami deposits.

77
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,540
It's a,
it's a very turbulent phenomena,

78
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,500
brings up pebbles and rocks and disturbs
the beaches and,

79
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,450
uh,
you can detect some of those.

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,050
Um,
but in particularly for the,

81
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,120
for the particular case of the Pacific 
northwest,

82
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,730
uh,
around 1700,

83
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,940
actually in 1700 a tsunami was 
generated.

84
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,490
It was recorded in Japan.
And by looking at the,

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,710
uh,
tsunami records in Japan,

86
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,573
both the historical record and the 
actual geologic record of that tsunami 

87
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,733
modelers have been able to kind of back 
project that go backwards across the 

88
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,134
Pacific show that the source of that 
tsunami was in fact the Pacific 

89
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,990
northwest,
and get a good date 1700,

90
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,220
uh,
for that event.

91
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,130
That event looks like to be about a 
magnitude nine,

92
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,023
nine and a half.
That's bigger than what we had in Chile 

93
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,600
last,
uh,

94
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,120
just a few weeks ago.
Uh,

95
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,013
and it's about as big as the biggest 
earthquake we've recorded 

96
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,743
instrumentally.
So now that we know that that boundary 

97
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:57,280
can support a monstrous earthquake,
magnitude nine,

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,270
we can go about the job of measuring the
Wa,

99
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,150
how fast the plates are converging,
making some assumptions about how stress

100
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
is building up and come up with some 
sense of what the repeat interval might 

101
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,570
be for that earthquake.
And,

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,433
uh,
sad to say we're pretty close to the 

103
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,480
repeat interval for that earthquake.
So that's a forecast.

104
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,250
It's not a prediction,
it's a forecast.

105
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,980
And thankfully,
at least in the United States,

106
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,130
going back a decade or more,
uh,

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,830
seattle and Oregon had been well aware 
of the potential for that earthquake,

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,750
and they're taking the appropriate 
steps.

109
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:31,540
One would say,
to try to mitigate the potential damage.
