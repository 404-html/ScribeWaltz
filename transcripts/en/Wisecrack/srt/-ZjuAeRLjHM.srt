1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,340
A wise crack.
Jared,

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,530
again,
while you guys probably think of key and

3
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:07,364
Peele as the duo that gave us president 
Obama's anger translator or the 

4
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,340
visionaries that finally made an action 
movie about a kitten,

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,293
they're also responsible for some of the
smartest comedy that's reasonably grace 

6
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:18,014
the airwaves.
And while much of their success can be 

7
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:23,180
chalked up to their unique and often 
absurd characters,

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,163
they're true brilliance lies and they're
streamlined writing style and a 

9
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,940
commitment to sketches that are as 
funny.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,030
He wrote town like Atlanta as they are 
socially and emotionally true.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,220
I thought I was going to need rope tie.
Oh you are.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,260
And how do they tell that truth?
Well,

13
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:42,470
let's find out since nothing is better 
than overexplaining a joke.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,363
Welcome to this wise crack condition on 
key and Peele and I guess there's sort 

15
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:50,810
of spoilers ahead to really understand 
what makes key and Peele so great.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,733
We need to look a bit deeper and 
discover the comedic philosophy that 

17
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:56,060
informs their work.
And believe it or not,

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,940
these guys follow in the footsteps of 
this guy,

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,233
the door through which you will.
For those of you unfamiliar that isn't 

20
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,370
the Demon lovechild of Dan Harmon,
Alan Morin's,

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,530
Levoy Jijak,
that's del close,

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,130
a pioneer of comedy who still hugely 
influential today,

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,180
but before we get into how key and peele
embody closest comedic philosophy,

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,940
we need to take a look at a little 
comedy science.

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,390
While you probably don't associate 
science with comedy,

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,283
who can better understand the success of
many key and peele sketches by 

27
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:29,750
distilling them down to a core comedic 
structure.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,793
In this structure,
we start in a world with a built in set 

29
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:36,410
of expectations,
which is then contrasted with an unusual

30
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:41,300
behavior and this behavior is heightened
and explored until you've pissed herself

31
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,134
from laughing so hard and other the 
words comedy is arrived at through 

32
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,524
exploring a behavior that breaks with 
the expectations we have of a given 

33
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:49,664
situation.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,700
If we wanted to go full,
beautiful mind on this structure,

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,160
it might look a little something like 
this.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,113
Reasonable reality instead of 
expectations plus unusual behavior and 

37
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,374
or point of view multiplied by raised 
emotional stakes plus an ending which 

38
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:08,030
subverts established pattern equals 
comedy bliss,

39
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,983
but enough comedic calculus.
Let's take a look at substitute teacher 

40
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,494
as an example.
The schedule opens in a high school 

41
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:18,530
classroom and environment that carries 
with it a set of standard expectations.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,840
Board students,
chalkboards books,

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,120
and a teacher trying to wield some 
authority.

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,750
But all this changes when Mr Garvey 
begins taking attendance.

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,700
The colon,
which they call a net.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,470
No,
Jay Kuala here.

47
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,470
Yeah.
Uh,

48
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,130
do you mean jacqueline?
Now that we have are unusual behavior?

49
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,103
I he,
Mr Garvey's inability to pronounce 

50
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:45,350
stereotypically white names,
things can really get cooking.

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,590
We get to see both the logic behind Mr 
Garvey's frustration.

52
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,523
I'm the rail.
The rail along with the increasingly 

53
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:57,410
terrified students as Mr Garvey 
continues this unusual behavior is anger

54
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,244
increases while their fear.
This simple underlying logic is what 

55
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,810
helps accelerate the comedy with each 
move.

56
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,763
Once we see this pattern repeated a few 
times were already predicting the next 

57
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,400
move,

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,020
they're not messed up.
Hey Rod,

59
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,420
not to be bested by an attentive 
audience.

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,313
This sketch ends by flipping our 
expectations for once Mr Garvey gets it 

61
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:18,740
right?

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,700
Timothy [inaudible].
Thank you.

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,410
Let's see how this pattern plays out in 
some other sketches.

64
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,403
For example,
we expect to babysit babysitter to have 

65
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:31,160
a quiet night,
but and unusual behaviors introduced

66
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,250
google guy,
guy I why milk

67
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,600
and this behavior gets emotionally 
heightened.

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,780
Your in charge of me in my house.
All right,

69
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,623
can for forest,
it's time for bed with a last minute 

70
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:46,910
reveal that offers a glimpse into the 
comedic logic.

71
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,010
Hush baby forrest whitaker don't say a 
word guy.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,510
Guy was going to buy.
You were mocking bird

73
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,453
in another sketch.
We start with a fairly mundane setting 

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,920
until we meet our unusual companions who
are intent on living there,

75
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,450
vigilante air marshal dream.

76
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,443
I tell you one thing,
if not 11th or to happen up on it here 

77
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:11,720
plain.
Don't worry.

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
We got there.

79
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,810
The stakes are then raised well above 
cruising altitude.

80
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:15,970
Yeah.

81
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,870
You know how mark and up that plane,
oh God.

82
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,910
And rather than fizzling out by running 
the pattern to the ground,

83
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,300
we get a surprise at the end.
That reframes what we've just seen.

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,793
Of course,
we know that sketches that don't follow 

85
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,920
this pattern can also be hilarious.
Who can deny the pure joy of will?

86
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:37,754
Ferrell's gyrating midriff.
I gotta have my cop out or the wonder 

87
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,030
testicular double Entendre of Alec 
Baldwin's baked goods.

88
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,760
No one can resist my schweddy balls and 
hell,

89
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,030
even key and peele occasionally basket 
in the purely absurd.

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,970
Oh,
there we go.

91
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,040
There we go.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,440
Comedic structure is only half the 
story.

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,450
While they're sketches are certainly 
funny,

94
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,343
it's another element of their work that 
ensures that they're also smart key 

95
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,580
appeals commitment to finding 
fundamental human truth in comedy.

96
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,640
This philosophy is not an invention of 
key and peele.

97
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,623
However,
they both cut their comedic chops in 

98
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,664
Chicago.
A city whose comedy scene is permeated 

99
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:18,040
by this guy del close,
and while you may not have heard of him,

100
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,963
he's responsible for training a few 
decent comedians and along the way he 

101
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,600
helped write a book called truth in 
comedy with Sharna Halpern.

102
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,250
That's become a Bible for comedians 
around the world in its,

103
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,093
they are you that the best comedy comes 
from mining the depths of human 

104
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:33,754
existence and that this creates the 
grounds for comedy that is both funny 

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,090
and smart and idea that we see 
everywhere in key and peele.

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,073
Oh and del close once claimed that a 
coven of witches cured him of his 

107
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,380
cocaine addiction.

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,400
This has nothing to do with comedy,
but I think it's worth noting.

109
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,470
This commitment to truth isn't exclusive
to Chicago Comedians as this emotionally

110
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:53,304
honest style has dominated recently from
the diner to the break room do the 

111
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,534
streets of Italy.
Now does this commitment to truth mean 

112
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,080
that good comedy always has to reflect 
on real and truthful situations?

113
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,973
Hell No.
But while a post apocalyptic alien 

114
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,230
invasion might not reflect the reality 
of the world we live in,

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,213
sorry to anyone currently on acid,
the core comedic idea is still grounded 

116
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,354
in something fundamentally true.
That key and peels characters can 

117
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,840
instantly know who is an alien by their 
reaction to blackness.

118
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,943
How did you know

119
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,020
C'mon redneck wants us to move into his 
community us.

120
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,860
The friendlier the white characters are,
the more certain they are of their alien

121
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,930
nature.
Would you let me tell your daughter,

122
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,013
let's return to Mr Garvey.
What's the truth that makes this sketch 

123
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,530
so funny for a start?
This sketch reverses the trope of a well

124
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:47,430
intentioned teach for America type out 
to save a bunch of inner city kids.

125
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,413
This role reversal produces both the 
immediate comedy of Mr Garvey's 

126
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,113
mispronunciations and the socially 
conscious fact that this is something 

127
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:55,974
that happens to minority students all 
the time except in that case it's more 

128
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:04,110
uncomfortable than it is funny.
Wow.

129
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:07,890
Mr Garvey's reaction to a name like 
denise and Aaron are hilarious.

130
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,070
Key and Peele are forcing us to ask a 
more complicated question.

131
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,963
What if black teachers where as 
culturally incompetent as their white 

132
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:15,384
counterparts and thus we have a double 
pronged comedic attack come for the 

133
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:21,450
laughter and stay for the socially 
conscious criticism.

134
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,523
The benefit of this mixture of comedic 
structure and finding the truth is that 

135
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,590
hilarious sketches can be found in any 
area of life,

136
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,820
race,
religion,

137
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,010
the dark side of professional sports.
You name it,

138
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,993
and they often do so by relating to 
personal experience and their first 

139
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:36,720
sketch titled

140
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,540
Bay.

141
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,770
There's a focus on the tensions found in
black masculinity between being a strong

142
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:46,710
Alpha male and a committed partner.
I looked this woman,

143
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,663
you told me six 45 you said that this 
sketch heightens the limits that to 

144
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,184
friends will go to,
to keep up the facade of being a hard 

145
00:07:59,141 --> 00:07:59,974
ass,
getting further and further away from 

146
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:06,364
their spouses in the process and the 
interstellar lengths they'll go to to 

147
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,040
maintain this facade,
represent the actual effort,

148
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,530
man we'll put into prove they're one of 
the bros.

149
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,543
And of course this sketch highlights the
absurdity of this whole macho 

150
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:21,934
performance.

151
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,170
This theme is also explored in the 
expanded key and Peele universe as their

152
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:37,370
first feature film Keanu throws to 
normal suburban black men into the world

153
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,204
of organized crime and drug dealing 
where they have to impersonate to 

154
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,624
legendary street assassins.
At one point we see the two main 

155
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:45,044
characters performing a stereotypical 
sort of black masculinity play Somnio 

156
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,950
real quick.
And conversely,

157
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,813
we see some of the hardened gangsters 
brought to tears by the music of George 

158
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,053
Michael.
They use a similar strategy in the 

159
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:01,494
sketch office homophobe where we see a 
tense interaction between two office 

160
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,873
space.
You can't handle hearing about how I'm 

161
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,280
gay.
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,820
You just referring to your boyfriend's 
penis as a baby's arm holding an apple.

163
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,210
What happened?
I looked like,

164
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,340
which leads to a serious accusation,
homophobic.

165
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,323
And while this sketch at first seems to 
set up a tired trope in which the humor 

166
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,610
is derived from a flamboyant gay 
stereotype.

167
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
That's disgusting.
Oh,

168
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,154
I see.
So you don't want to see up close the 

169
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:32,820
pitch of my anus cause you hate day,
man.

170
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,270
This expectation is ended when the 
homophobes boyfriend shows up.

171
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,710
It's my boyfriend.
How are you doing?

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,233
I'm doing very well.
Which leads to a surprising realization 

173
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,014
for keys.
Character.

174
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,420
I get it.
I'm not persecuted.

175
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm just a APP.
And the truth of this sketch,

176
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,860
well no matter your sexual preference or
gender identity,

177
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,843
you can still be an asshole.
I'm more common source of comedic 

178
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,620
inspiration has always been good old 
fashion.

179
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:59,650
Religion and critiques of religion are 
not new

180
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,370
when it comes to boots.
Big Time Major League.

181
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,560
You have to stand in awe,
in awe of the all time champion of false

182
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,510
promises and exaggerated claims religion

183
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,603
rather than following in the footsteps 
of those who find comedy in skewering 

184
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:19,114
religion.
Ford's irrational claims key and peele 

185
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:24,490
find a much more human take on religion 
and in particular Christianity.

186
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,563
The sketch opens with a group of earnest
believers in prayer and this group of 

187
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:31,560
Christians is rewarded with a visit from
the voice of God himself.

188
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,323
However,
once God responds to their prayers with 

189
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,000
some practical next step,

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,380
so whole

191
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,843
they become slightly less enthused.
Eventually they find a nice loophole to 

192
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:54,510
avoid having to actually follow God's 
command of service.

193
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,463
Oh,

194
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,873
sketch just so great because it offers a
funny critique of religion with some 

195
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:05,880
genuine theological nuance.
The joke isn't on religion in general or

196
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:06,714
believers in particular.
Rather it points out the hub holocracy 

197
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,074
of those unwilling to take their own 
religious tradition seriously when it 

198
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:16,050
comes to following through on a not so 
fun obligation.

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,260
This critique is actually one founded in
Christianity itself.

200
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,070
As the book of James Famously says,
faith without works is dead.

201
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,143
Even your most devout onto couldn't 
disagree with this one and even more 

202
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:30,630
brutally honest social critique can be 
seen in their sketch sound off,

203
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,583
which is set at basic training.
While we assume that the drill sergeant 

204
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,870
is going to lead the song in some absurd
direction,

205
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,763
it ends up finding comedy in a place of 
harsh realism from Port Orford and 

206
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,260
Armando Uris Hall are from all families.
Cow Fall,

207
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:48,010
we roam,
sold the rich church can just,

208
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,223
Oh,
the sketch doesn't only point out the 

209
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:53,090
disparity and who ends up fighting 
America's wars,

210
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,320
but also the reality of what awaits 
soldiers coming home from war.

211
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,390
When I come home with the kids when I 
come home with PTSD,

212
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,100
the Va hospital,

213
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,110
somehow they managed to make a sketch 
about economic inequality and inadequate

214
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,030
medical care in the military.
Funny,

215
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,953
while they have multiple sketches that 
use the absurdity of football for 

216
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,460
comedic fuel bootsie wow.
This,

217
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:20,060
he could call me todd royal,
wrapping up Russia like aluminum foil in

218
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:20,894
quarterback concussion.
They use the trope of the heroic 

219
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:26,480
quarterback to shine some light on the 
medical reality of the game.

220
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,463
After taking a big hit,
we see the quarterback go from confused 

221
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,810
seriously about what do we do it too 
quickly offering fictional baked good.

222
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh,
you have to.

223
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,770
Joe was ass man has put an apple pie to 
go around

224
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,120
for getting diagnosed by a teammate.

225
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,003
You have a brain injury.
You need to get some medical and same 

226
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,470
suit

227
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,910
after seemingly getting it together in a
rousing chance of team spirit.

228
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,690
Quarterback notices a missing piece of 
his identity as a rhino.

229
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,780
Oh my God,
somebody stole my heart

230
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,580
runs off in an effective parody of the 
inspirational sports movie genre key and

231
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,414
Peele or showing us what it would look 
like if these movies accurately 

232
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,880
represented the horrific injuries 
suffered by athletes.

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,833
While that's just a few examples,
keon peels five seasons plus Keanu are 

234
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:17,940
filled with hours of insanely smart and 
insanely funny sketches and because most

235
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:18,774
of their work is grounded in true human 
emotions and situations rather than 

236
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,554
topical humor.
These sketches really hold up but most 

237
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:29,340
importantly key and peele serve as a 
reminder for the greatness of the TSA.

238
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,770
I'm ts monk

239
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,820
so if you see any terry's trying to get 
froggy,

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,820
you should always remember to correct 
hell scow.

241
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,140
