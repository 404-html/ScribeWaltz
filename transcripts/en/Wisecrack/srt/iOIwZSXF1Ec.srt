culture gear more on Luke crate at the 

3
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:07,754
end of the video.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,180
Hey,
wise crack jared again.

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,014
And today we're looking at the candy 
flavored fever dream that is adventure 

6
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,930
time with Finn and Jake.
Now in their final season of adventures,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,960
we want it to look at what makes the 
show so special.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,900
And while there are lots of reasons 
people love adventure time,

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,823
I'm going to argue it has a lot to do 
with a storytelling style as old as 

10
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:33,690
written storytelling itself and an epic 
to epic for most to finish d elliot.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,840
So let's see how adventure time tells a 
story.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,540
And as always spoilers ahead.
Of course,

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,374
some of the similarities to the classics
of old come down to the Ed venturing 

14
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,630
part.
The classics have monsters,

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:48,750
dramatic rescues,
long journeys to Distinct Kingdoms and a

16
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,000
beautiful princess that sends soldiers 
to battle.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,953
The Elliot is also sometimes referred to
as the song of helium and is written in 

18
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,800
verse giving it strong links to music.
Likewise,

19
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,634
adventure time features,
plenty of music and songs throughout at 

20
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,370
seasons.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,500
Thank you.
Pancakes making big and pancakes takes a

22
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,470
big enough to put it in a cake.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,770
And characters even occasionally speak 
in rhyme.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,210
I've caught thumb thing for you.
Oh my whole show,

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,360
don't you know?
Yeah.

26
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:17,150
Might Stub your toe.
The Elliot and adventure time.

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,300
Also both start with a musical call to 
hear their story.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,063
Thanks your time.
Grab your friends to fairy dust and 

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,913
lands right.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,160
But what really connects adventure time 
with epics like the Iliad,

31
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:34,010
the Odyssey or the alien is a surprising
one.

32
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,040
The structure of poetry.
Rebecca sugar,

33
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,730
former adventure time writer,
one set of show Creator Pendleton Ward.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,270
He's expressing thoughts about very 
modern feelings that people have.

35
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,223
Good poetry is like that.
Many of the things that venture time is 

36
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:48,644
known for have origins in poetry.
It's mix of modern and classical 

37
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:52,514
language.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,460
Fast,
tight,

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,140
you fun to do.

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,303
It's music.
It's use of colorful and evocative 

41
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,000
imagery.
The invention of new words,

42
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,730
objects and creatures.
Oh my God,

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,400
you guys.
Drama bomb and just how plain surreal at

44
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,234
all is.
But one of the most telling ways it 

45
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,274
relates to poetry is in its length 
adventure times episodes only last 

46
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,730
roughly 10 minutes,
half your average TV show,

47
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,700
which means each episode relies on 
compression.

48
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,310
Can you hear any story?
It's been compressed.

49
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,430
It jettisons the boring details for the 
exciting stuff,

50
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,563
classical poetry and a lot of modern 
poetry to hustle pre from rules on how 

51
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,480
this compression is achieved.
The Elliot,

52
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:35,314
for instance,
compresses each line in toy form of 

53
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:39,890
poetic rhythm or meter called Deck Tilak
Heck Salmon,

54
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,880
which is a fancy way of saying each line
must be exactly 18 silk.

55
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,230
Almost all poetry,
even if it doesn't use meter,

56
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:51,430
is a mode of compression and sure movies
compressed stories to a few hours.

57
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,020
TV compresses them to under an hour,
but adventure time is even more hardcore

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,840
compressing a whole story in to 10 
minutes.

59
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,973
This type of stripping down requires the
essential elements be focused on in 

60
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,544
imaginative ways.
In the episode [inaudible] Fin lives an 

61
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,890
entire lifetime in a pillow dimension or
he gets married,

62
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,860
has kids,
and grows old all in 10 minutes.

63
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,723
This economy of exposition shows how 
compression feeds creativity and helps 

64
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:21,781
focus the story and unlike other stories
that get compressed in infuriating ways.

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,923
Game of thrones season seven venture 
time uses this compression to be more 

66
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,244
outlandish.
The first shot of boy features raining 

67
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,484
knives outside,
which shows us why the characters are 

68
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,100
stuck indoors within the first second 
without having to tell us,

69
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,700
but aside from just both poems and 
adventure time are short.

70
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,820
We can also draw similarities between 
how they use these narratives.

71
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,770
Snippets to tell a larger story.

72
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,170
Traditionally in an epic poem,
the Iliad,

73
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,170
the text is broken up into paragraphs 
called stanzas.

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,070
Stanzas composed larger chapters called 
Cantos from the Italian word for song.

75
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,930
You could see a season of a TV show as a
canto and an episode as a stanza.

76
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,100
The stands focuses on the individual and
their feelings,

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,993
a short vignette or seen.
It gives an insight into someone's 

78
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,940
character even if it lasts a lifetime,
like in the [inaudible] episode.

79
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,640
It Canto,
on the other hand is the accumulation of

80
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,474
the scenes that tell the story of 
several characters or a whole world in 

81
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,060
Dante's inferno,
another epic poem,

82
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,970
the stands that will be a short 
interaction or description,

83
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,270
but the canto will be the story of a 
whole circle of hell.

84
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,523
Just like the Elliot and other epics.
Adventure time tells it stories on a 

85
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,004
micro and macro level.
Not only are there the contain 

86
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:33,514
narratives of each episode,
but an overall narrative that reflects 

87
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,410
the history of the land of uz through 
dialogue,

88
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,390
geography,
and even just certain names.

89
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,180
We discover the different types of 
government and rulers.

90
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,130
Who Has Kim,
oh,

91
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,523
Ooh,
that the main deity is a cosmic owl and 

92
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,880
especially from the episode Simon and 
Marcy,

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,060
it's hinted that ou was formed after a 
nuclear apocalypse.

94
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,223
One of the most interesting ways in 
which adventure time can be compared to 

95
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,404
poetry is with something called Bathos.
Bathos is a sort of anticlimax a sudden 

96
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:08,830
shift in tone or thoroughly mediocre and
to a suspenseful moment.

97
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,963
There are some great examples of this 
and the classics like the defeat of 

98
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:17,311
Achilles and invincible warrior brought 
down by the Lamest of weaknesses is heel

99
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,813
and in paradise lost.
We learned that divine angels defecate 

100
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,593
not through their poop shoots but from a
kind of missed from their skin that is 

101
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,940
bathos something built up then brought 
crashing down to earth.

102
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,403
Adventure time is full of this.
Just when something gets too dangerous 

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,200
or scary,
I have come for you or romantic,

104
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,730
kiss me,
Thin Amin,

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,770
kiss me.
Then it's either interrupted or undercut

106
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,530
by another character undermining it or 
it off.

107
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,130
Yeah,
busy crossing you,

108
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:01,120
man.
No,

109
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:02,920
he's just hugging me gently.

110
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,150
Well,
venture time is not the only show to use

111
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,500
bath.
Those for the sake of humor,

112
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,630
how things are going.
Again,

113
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,550
easy here.
Ooh,

114
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:14,420
child things,
they'll get pride.

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,333
It certainly helps make some of the more
creepy moments palatable to a younger 

116
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:21,290
audience.
Beth,

117
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,123
this is also often integral to the 
storytelling and the moral message of 

118
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,170
the show.
Characters.

119
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,004
Usually villains are introduced and 
dispensed with in an episode and even 

120
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,100
longstanding ones like the ice king 
develop using bathos.

121
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,380
I was going to start up on the 
elliptical again,

122
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:37,060
but I got depressed.
Okay.

123
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,013
One of the key lessons you learned from 
adventure time is prejudice is bad or 

124
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,390
the more cliched.
Don't judge a book by its cover.

125
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,493
This is accomplished by setting up a 
villain as evil and then finding out 

126
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,140
they're simply misunderstood as is.

127
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,430
I'm hot again.
Thanks

128
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,670
dunes or a good guy who was a villain 
all along.

129
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,670
This type of bathetic technique is used 
frequently in poetry,

130
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:02,570
both from antiquity and today.
It is also a linchpin for character arcs

131
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:06,120
and adventure time and an integral part 
of how it tells its story.

132
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,890
Although some sea adventure time as 
prime TV for stoners,

133
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,160
I am the dream warrior.
I have summoned you here to hang with me

134
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,210
and you're together.
Dream.

135
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,490
Are you going to show us a move to beat 
the farm?

136
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,310
There's a fierce fandom out there who 
have invested a lot of time interpreting

137
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,960
the shows,
rather fake narrative.

138
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,063
The same can also be set up poetry,
which can oftentimes seem intentionally 

139
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:27,024
cryptic end.
Even though poetry isn't as cool as 

140
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:32,220
whoever this Jake Paul Dude is.
Adventure time is a prime example of how

141
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:36,120
millennia old poetic techniques are 
still being used to tell funny,

142
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:36,954
sensitive,
and downright weird stories and two 

143
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,620
extraordinary effect.

144
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,660
Thanks for watching guys.
Peace.

145
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,110
