1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,763
Oh,
hi mark.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,380
Hi Mark.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,270
Greetings and welcome to earthling 
cinema.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm your host Garrick's worm.
You Lloyd.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,490
This week's artifact is the room 
written,

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:21,900
directed,
and starring.

7
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,820
My time traveling.
God's son,

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,660
Tommy Wiser.
The film follows human banker Johnny,

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,710
who despite everything about him is 
taken seriously by his friends.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,703
I was so happy.
I have you as my best friend and I love 

11
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,890
Lisa so much.
He lives with the apple of his eyeball,

12
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,724
Lisa,
and they are madly in love for two 

13
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,320
scenes,
tired of Johnny's esophagus disorder.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,280
Lisa cheats on him with his bff,
forelle mark,

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,650
last name unknown.
In fact,

16
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,200
Lisa so done with Johnny's smoking hot 
bod.

17
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,870
She gets him drunk to frame him for 
domestic abuse.

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,930
Johnny naturally denies this to no one 
in particular.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,090
It's both.
Did Not hit her.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,300
Did Not.
Oh,

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,680
hi mark.
And makes his home phone where?

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,130
Wire at an evacuation from the womb 
party.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,100
Mark and Lisa are caught swapping DNA 
orally.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,650
Why are you doing this?
To save the relationship,

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,340
Johnny announces that Lisa is more 
pregnant than a dramatic pause.

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,050
We're expecting.
Lisa,

27
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:20,400
of course,
denies this.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,473
There is no baby.
Johnny Imitates a horse and market tax 

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,690
him before he can lay an egg 
heartbroken.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,330
Johnny locks himself in an indoor Porta 
potty,

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,540
the phone rats on Lisa and they agree to
a bitter breakup.

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,160
Get Out,
get out,

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,940
get out of my life completely done with 
earth females.

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,740
Johnny sucks.
A glock.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
The room is a tale of duplicity and the 
follies of love and trust to things I 

36
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,614
know little about the film takes many 
cues from classic dramas such as rebel 

37
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:01,191
Wilson Without a cause and the streetcar
named desire.

38
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:02,784
Part one,

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,420
the latter of which provided sematic 
inspiration for the room,

40
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,343
which was oh,
acknowledges with a little wink in the 

41
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:16,470
cold.
Open Streetcar Concerns Blanche Dubai,

42
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,583
a formerly wealthy female who tries to 
hide her past but winds up in Arkham 

43
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,700
asylum when her fantasy world crumbles 
just like blanche.

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,840
The characters in the room live 
duplicitous often under the influence of

45
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:29,441
c,
two,

46
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,720
h six zero.
A wasted.

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,420
I love you,
Darling.

48
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,323
Lisa pretends to be a devoted lover,
but in reality is only using johnny for 

49
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:38,674
his sweet bitcoin.
Mark pretends to be a loyal friend when 

50
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,334
he's actually in bed with Lisa fucking 
suggesting the soullessness that comes 

51
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,104
with living a lie.
Almost all the characters deliver their 

52
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,000
performances in a robotic fashion.
Oh,

53
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:52,834
hey.
How you doing?

54
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,860
Yeah,
I'm very busy.

55
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,694
What's going on?
That is to say with a battery of their 

56
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,490
butts.
You're right.

57
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,890
The computer business is too 
competitive.

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,083
The film accentuates this effect by 
juxtaposing these lifeless characters 

59
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,610
with the visceral energy of Chris r 
Kelly,

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,713
although he's a criminal,
he's the only character who is honest 

61
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,624
about who he is and therefore he's the 
only one who appears high on life and 

62
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,304
crack what is just as in streetcar,
the room centers around a domestic 

63
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,000
location,
Johnnie's apartment.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,680
The titular Tommy [inaudible] the room 
by concentrating the action on the home.

65
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,310
The film focuses on the relationships 
that form the sort of conflict.

66
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,820
The room takes a skeptical view of these
interpersonal,

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,683
intra human connections.
Johnny appears to have a ton of friends 

68
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,060
on facebook,
but in actuality they're just liking his

69
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:45,061
status is out of boredom anymore.
He's not worth it.

70
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,743
The visual Motif of a foot sphere and 
capsulates the film's pessimistic view 

71
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,390
of friendship,
although intended for comradery,

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,740
it causes injury to two characters on 
your mat come up.

73
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,763
The message is clear.
Friendship can hurt and mostly happens 

74
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,790
in alleyways.
Similarly,

75
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,450
early in the film,
the color red symbolizes love and sex in

76
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:11,260
the city and everything from Lisa's red 
dress to these red candles,

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,950
to the roses in the bedroom to this ball
gag at the end of the film.

78
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,540
However,
when Johnny rips up,

79
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,900
the red dress shoots himself and dies in
an ocean of blood,

80
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,390
also known as hitting the Johnny.
The colors,

81
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,224
meaning is transformed to reflect the 
eventual outcome of some relationships 

82
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,660
and all of humanity in its emotional 
climax and sexual climax.

83
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,580
The film breaks the fourth wall.
When denny uses wise,

84
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,423
those real first name,
johnny plays brilliantly turning the 

85
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,924
camera on the audience.
The film forces us to question whether 

86
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:47,410
we are deluding ourselves.
I mean this film won an Oscar,

87
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,030
right?
Didn't it?

88
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,090
I mean,
crashed.

89
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:53,924
Did

90
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,800
for earthlink.
Cinema.

91
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,460
