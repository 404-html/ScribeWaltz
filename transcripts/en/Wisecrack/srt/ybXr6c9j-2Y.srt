00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,820
a wise crack.
Jared,

5
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:11,170
again,
southpark creators,

6
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:13,780
Matt Stone and Trey Parker sure do make 
us laugh,

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,820
but they make something else to a metric
crap ton of money.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,280
It's a tale as old as time,
greatest stop,

9
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,750
motion,
animated Christmas card,

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,370
nab,
comedy central series,

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,320
a movie,
an Oscar nomination,

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,831
Yada,
Yada,

13
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:27,700
Yada,
and joy.

14
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,020
A collective net worth of $800,
million dollars.

15
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,043
Yet,
despite being an ad supported business 

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,850
like some other people,
we know south park has never been afraid

17
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:37,684
to bite the hand that feeds it.
So let's take a look at how stone and 

18
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,104
Parker lampooned the financial world 
across four of our favorite south park 

19
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:44,974
adventures cash rules,
everything around us in this widespread 

20
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:51,900
condition on economics in south park,
in gnomes,

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,970
the sleepy town of South Park readies 
itself,

22
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,804
very classic David and Goliath battle,
a real showdown between massive 

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,410
corporate coffee chain,
hard books and the homegrown mom and pop

24
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,790
coffee shop tweak brother.

25
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,903
You see,
I own a coffee shop and now a great big 

26
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:09,040
multimillion dollar company is going to 
move in and try to take all my business,

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,320
which means I may have to shut down and 
sell my son,

28
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,250
tweak into slavery.

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,230
South Park challenges are natural bias 
towards the little guy by demonstrating,

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,153
hey,
sometimes the little guy is actually a 

31
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:19,674
total asshole and in south park this 
particular asshole isn't above keeping 

32
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:27,090
his own son hopped up on caffeine or 
exploiting children for the media.

33
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,620
If it helps us business stay afloat,
it's time to stop large corporations.

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,513
Prop 10 is about children.
Vote yes on prop 10 or else you hate 

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,253
children.
The very notion that a small business 

36
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,894
might be driven by impure capitalist 
motives is a message we're not used to 

37
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,960
hearing and the townspeople of Southpark
aren't ready for it either,

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,853
which is why the tweak and horror books 
rivalry is neatly stereotyped as just 

39
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,024
another innocent family business versus 
a big fat magic carpet guy from New 

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
York.
In fact,

41
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,114
throughout the episode,
most arguments in favor of big business 

42
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,200
are immaturely,
shouted down,

43
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,770
not with reason or facts,
but well with immature shouting.

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,611
Oh,
pardon me,

45
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,750
Mr assface.
Anyway,

46
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,590
let's hear your side of the argument.
So who's the real bully here?

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
GNOMES demonstrates how bald face 
appeals to emotion can be used to 

48
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:17,930
disguise the cold hard mechanisms of 
profit.

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,923
I've got one for you.
How about doing a report on how large 

50
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,520
corporations take over little family 
owned businesses,

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,433
although he may be a staple of the 
community who charms people with this 

52
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:27,974
folksy marketing Mr.
tweak proves himself to be an even more 

53
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,514
cutthroat capitalist than his rival.
Kids are great to get people on our 

54
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:34,964
side.
You don't just throw a child in a 

55
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,454
political commercial to sale your 
beliefs and it isn't long before the 

56
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,144
preteen protagonists of southpark become
convenient ponds in his agenda as 

57
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:48,680
they're forced to passes anti-corporate 
words off as their own,

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,553
and as the voluminous corporate 
automaton bulldoze its way through 

59
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,743
Belgium America.
Perhaps there is no stopping the 

60
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,790
corporate machine

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,423
knowing much about Mr Weekes true 
business practices or even about the 

62
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,730
superior quality of the starbucks 
coffee.

63
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,330
It doesn't have that blend.
Raw sewage taste that tweaks coffee.

64
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,164
Has the people of South Park demonstrate
a programmatic response that boils down 

65
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,220
to simply small business,
good big corporation back.

66
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,423
Does it matter if the big corporation is
actually an ethical business and if the 

67
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,250
children in question are foul mouth hell
raisers,

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,673
no it doesn't,
and that's thanks to a principle called 

69
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,703
the backfire effect which says the 
presentation of any new and contrary 

70
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:40,630
information will be dismissed outright 
threatens your basic belief structure.

71
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,510
Try arguing with people on facebook 
about politics.

72
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,790
We're confident you'll change their 
minds.

73
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,220
The gnomes episode of South Park 
lampoons.

74
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,540
This idea of hardwired biases by 
demonstrating small businesses just like

75
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,290
small children can be just as scummy as 
their larger counterparts.

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,440
They're just not as prolific about it 
because after all,

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,333
as the underpants gnomes of the episode 
adorably demonstrate both small and 

78
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:04,564
large businesses are geared towards 
making a profit even if there might be 

79
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:11,020
some ambiguity about the path toward 
that objective,

80
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,570
collect underpants.

81
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,723
Where are the gnomes episode satirizes 
exploitation of children for emotional 

82
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,620
sympathy,
cash for gold,

83
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:30,460
satirizes the exploitation of the 
elderly for massive profit,

84
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,563
and how better to demonstrate this con 
inaction then by way of the home 

85
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,690
shopping network.
In this episode stand learns his Grandpa

86
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,524
has routinely fallen victim to 
television scams that are draining his 

87
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,180
retirement funds.
Meanwhile,

88
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,380
Cartman's rank opportunism drives him to
take advantage of those same scams,

89
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,620
to feed his insatiable greed from these 
two angles.

90
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,454
Cash for Gold examines both the Predator
and the prey through the lens of value 

91
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,834
theory.
There are different theories of value 

92
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:57,994
out there.
You've probably heard the kind dictated 

93
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,364
by supply and demand,
but value might not necessarily be a 

94
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,280
financial value,
but instead be rooted in social,

95
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:10,090
emotional or historical value and much 
like financial value,

96
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,983
these alternatives can be situational 
and fluid entering on a variety of 

97
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,420
intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,940
Let's take a look at some examples.
After stands,

99
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:23,530
grandpa give Stan a bolo tie that was 
bought off the TV for $6,000.

100
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,393
Stand almost immediately learns that the
very same tie is worth $15 at the local 

101
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,060
appraiser.
I'll give you $15.

102
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
Then after pursuing third and fourth 
opinions stand watches the Bolo Tie 

103
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,250
diminish and financial value right 
before his very eyes,

104
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,000
until it's worth no more than a seven 
layer burrito at Taco bell.

105
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,390
My grandpa paid $6,000
for something barely worth anything.

106
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,880
How does something like this happen?
To answer stands?

107
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,714
Question.
This episode introduces us to multiple 

108
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,414
forms of value beginning with the market
value displayed on the home shopping 

109
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,350
network.
As Dean,

110
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,184
the home shopping network hosts uses his
authority to convince his elderly 

111
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,760
viewers.
They're getting amazing deals.

112
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,940
Those same viewers reliably line dean's 
pockets.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,010
Even though what he's selling is in the 
frame of material or resale value,

114
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,760
pretty much a piece of crap.

115
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Look at these stunning airings.
These are genuine fo Sapphire earrings,

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,380
14 carat gold,
86 karat photo sapphire.

117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,400
This disconnect is the very mechanism 
that drives any great scam,

118
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,293
high perceived value,
married to low actual value where a 

119
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,434
purely labor oriented view of economics 
might consider the work that went into 

120
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,544
producing an item.
South Park here exhibits a more nuanced 

121
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:37,784
idea,
one that proposes value is determined 

122
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,050
not by quality or by effort of 
production,

123
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,913
but by the nature of supply and demand.
And boy does dean know how to drive and 

124
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:51,140
exploit that demand at that price.
You practically stolen from us.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,050
Ouch.
And later when Stan urges dean to commit

126
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,780
suicide,
you should carry yourself.

127
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,733
Dean is able to conceptualize his life's
work only in the monetary figure it 

128
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:04,910
might draw in a lawsuit.
Two point $7,000,000

129
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,330
for dean.
There's literally no useful value beyond

130
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,164
the financial freedom of value,
just how much cash he can squeeze from 

131
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,940
people's wallets.
However,

132
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:17,000
we clearly see the impact of emotional 
value.

133
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,910
When stands,
grandpa tells the story of his dog.

134
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,873
Brilliant.
Did I ever tell you I used to have a 

135
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,530
border collie named patches?
Yes,

136
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,960
grandpa.
I love that dog.

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,150
She always made me so happy when she 
died.

138
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,333
I didn't let myself get too sad because 
I thought thought I'd always have the 

139
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:42,081
memory of her slobbery and happy face.
I can't remember what she looked like.

140
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,340
Billy,

141
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,173
through this monologue,
we learn GRANDPA's reckless purchases 

142
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:51,240
have little to do with the perceived 
market value of the items in question.

143
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,223
No GRANDPA is trying to add emotional 
and historical value to himself by 

144
00:07:55,951 --> 00:08:00,150
creating memories and sentimental 
connections that will last long past his

145
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:01,770
death.
Elsewhere in the story,

146
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,604
we learned these fluid and disparate 
notions of value call into question the 

147
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,444
true value of nearly everything.
We see the perceived cultural value of 

148
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:10,824
an academy award evaporate as it's 
simply melted down to be resold in new 

149
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:15,684
forms stands gift to his grandfather.
A framed photo of Grandpa with his 

150
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:23,100
beloved dog arguably has astronomic 
emotional value,

151
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,130
but low market value thing completely.
That means a lot and GRANDPA's six grand

152
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,350
gift to Stan is ultimately written off 
as being

153
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,610
gay gay,

154
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,470
but

155
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,950
just how loose is that relationship 
between labor and profit.

156
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,310
That question sits at the foundation of 
go fund yourself,

157
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,450
an episode in which the South Park kids 
launched a successful brand that doesn't

158
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:50,840
even bother to put a business behind it.
A startup company,

159
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,770
a company that does what?
No,

160
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,890
we don't want to do anything.
In fact,

161
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:57,240
the official slogan of their company is 
lacking,

162
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,074
can make their business,
which ultimately calls itself The 

163
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,124
Washington redskins draws at success 
from the bastardization of modern 

164
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:09,090
kickstarter culture,
accepting monetary donations in exchange

165
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:14,091
for no effort at all.
Here we cut throat.

166
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,810
The episode southpark suggests that in 
the advent of twitter,

167
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,040
facebook,
and Instagram,

168
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,903
the success of a brand or company can 
now be routed purely in its appearance 

169
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,073
rather than its function.
One of the central arguments of this 

170
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,044
episode is that what a business does is 
less valuable to that business then the 

171
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,544
relative power of its brand.
When Stan sets off to find the perfect 

172
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:38,914
startup name,
this moment carries more important than 

173
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,380
any objective pursued by Cartman's 
leadership.

174
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,410
It's the greatest startup company name 
ever.

175
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,310
What Washington Red Skins,
I'm pretty sure that's taken carmen,

176
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,400
the episodes,
thesis,

177
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,360
mirrors and argument made by 
philosophers,

178
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,203
John Boatyard,
who argued in 1981 simulacra and 

179
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:58,394
simulations that all previous 
definitions of value had been woefully 

180
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:02,564
inadequate.
Boatyards work presented that value 

181
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,533
isn't determined by how much work has 
gone into making something or by the 

182
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,510
nature of it's materials or by its 
overall usefulness.

183
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,710
No value is determined purely as the 
appearance of value.

184
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,690
In other words,
according to beaudry art,

185
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,553
an item or brand is only valued as it 
exists as an image in relation to other 

186
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:23,774
things that are also images.
Value then is determined only in the 

187
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:27,764
relationship that exists between things 
or among a set of things through this 

188
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:32,474
frame.
It's more important for a business to 

189
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,830
have a great brand than it is to make 
great stuff.

190
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,640
It's more important to be trendy for 
investors than it is to make fat.

191
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,570
Stacks of cash.

192
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,190
Uber being worth billions of dollars 
while still losing billions of dollars.

193
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,083
Yeah,
Baudrillard more or less predicted that 

194
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,850
decades ago in Gofund yourself.
The South Park kids take this concept of

195
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:56,430
value to absurd heights,
much like the protagonist of Hbo,

196
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:57,264
his entourage,
they embrace the idea that the ultimate 

197
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:01,970
success lies in not doing anything at 
all.

198
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,610
Just startup cash instead out,
bro down,

199
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,240
but we still gotta love them because 
like so many in the real world,

200
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,300
the south park kids are just squirrels 
trying to get a nut.

201
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,090
Today's economy is awash with side 
Hustles,

202
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,760
independent contractors and guest 
lecturers,

203
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,210
but economic power lies not with them,
says South Park.

204
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,710
It sits with the fat cats at the top who
know how to work the system with minimal

205
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:25,544
effort or does it ultimately the kids,
Washington redskins venture is left in 

206
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:33,110
shambles because of the brands.
Missteps on a social issue.

207
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
There's nothing sweet about people who 
are decimated.

208
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,243
Here are the episode argues that a 
business built only on aesthetics has 

209
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,250
nowhere to turn and no foundational 
beliefs to hold two.

210
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,203
Once public opinion turns against it,
it turns out even a business that does 

211
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:48,404
almost nothing can be threatened by 
doing or saying or being the wrong 

212
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,970
thing.
At the time in South Park,

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,833
that outcome leaves our young 
entrepreneurs faded to the worst 

214
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:03,421
punishment of all.
I guess we got to go back to ski scratch

215
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:05,644
that there is in fact a worse punishment
than going to school and it arrives at 

216
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,830
the forefront of the episode titled You 
Have Zero Friends.

217
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,753
This episode examines the absurdities of
our growing social media economy as in 

218
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:20,440
the cash for gold adventure.
South Park here tackles head on the true

219
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,520
meaning of value.

220
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,960
Looking on facebook today,
we see that since adding a loser,

221
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:28,120
kip droughty as a friend dominic,

222
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,113
are our friendships and social worth 
measured by our likes and facebook 

223
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:33,254
connections,
or are they determined by the 

224
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:35,324
interactions we share in what the cyber 
punk community derisively refers to as 

225
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,020
space from the outset of the episode are
protagonists,

226
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:46,310
stand side by side in the meat space and
debate their respective levels of social

227
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:50,780
status as quantified solely by their 
collections of online friendships.

228
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,010
I don't have any friends

229
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,853
in this framing.
Facebook friendships like money create 

230
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:01,140
an easily measurable hierarchy of 
personal value.

231
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,033
I don't know what to do.
I just can't seem to get my friend 

232
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,760
numbers to go up.
The truth is,

233
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:08,370
as long as you have that Kip,
Jordy luther is a facebook friend,

234
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,260
people view your friendship as a 
liability.

235
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,393
You've got to dump him.

236
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,273
Cartman unsurprisingly sees 
relationships not as intrinsically 

237
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:16,234
joyful,
but as status symbols by which to 

238
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:21,990
elevate some people over others.
If this calls to mind beaudry again,

239
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,950
well,
it should because in his work,

240
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:27,970
the consumer society yard warned that 
instead of enhancing life,

241
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,863
a transactional approach to 
relationships leads to an individual 

242
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:32,284
lack.
Since everything possessed is 

243
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,144
relativized in relation to others,
cartman's troubling view of 

244
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,640
relationships begins to infect even 
kyle.

245
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,630
When Kyle's digital farm is depleted due
to economic hardship,

246
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,320
he turns to his long time meetspace 
friends,

247
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:49,210
Stan,
but even after Stan has offered kyle his

248
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,570
real world support,
all kyle can think about is how much his

249
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:55,270
own social media cache must be 
suffering.

250
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,330
Just so confused that I really need a 
friend right now.

251
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,771
Okay,
dude,

252
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,380
I'm,
I'm here for you Kay,

253
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,550
so then get on facebook and fertilize my
crops.

254
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,220
Shortly thereafter,
kyle drops the suite,

255
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,054
but socially toxic,
kip from his own roster of facebook 

256
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:13,240
friends in order to salvage his own 
social standing south park asks,

257
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,103
who are we really when our online 
presence outweighs our real world 

258
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,094
engagements,
when he insists her relationship with 

259
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,610
Stan,
be validated on the Internet,

260
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,563
and even randy doesn't believe in his 
connection with his own son until Stan 

261
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,660
agrees to add him on facebook,
so I'm not your friend.

262
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,493
Then

263
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,560
Dad,
you are my friend,

264
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,280
but you just don't want to add me as a 
friend

265
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,320
that it's just a stupid click of a 
button that takes two seconds,

266
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,460
right?
But you don't have the two seconds or in

267
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,750
our reality and in south park,
this disjunction between our digital and

268
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,584
real world lives threatens to place a 
greater premium on our digital behavior 

269
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,510
and it makes our physical life seem 
significant and less like an experience.

270
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,713
Perhaps.
That's why kyle pushes back against 

271
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,500
friendships with real people like 
standing kip.

272
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,393
When doing so means preserving his 
digital status and while everyone else 

273
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:11,240
is trying to pump up their digital lives
at the expense of their meetspace lives.

274
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,163
Pour,
kip is desperately trying to force his 

275
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:18,140
digital friendship into the meat space 
world by taking his laptop to the movies

276
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,760
for the argument in favor of cultivation
of an online brand is as simple as it is

277
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:23,594
daunting,
although it may not be as authentic as 

278
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,860
the quote unquote real you,
your profile,

279
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,790
your cyber influenced cast a much wider 
net than you do alone.

280
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,970
So whatever will you do with all of that
incredible power.

281
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,013
Hey,
here's an idea from your very close 

282
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,590

Thanks for watching guys.

283

Piece like many youtubers,
we often get asked how we make our 

284
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,204
videos,
which programs we use and how we learn 

285
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:46,934
to use them.
