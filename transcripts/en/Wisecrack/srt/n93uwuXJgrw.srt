Hey,
wise crack jared here.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,920
As you grow older,
you come to learn some hard truths.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,440
Santa isn't real.
Serial makes you fat.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,580
Space Jam is a bad movie.
It's a natural and inevitable course,

7
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:23,270
but that's why I'm here to bury your 
childhood completely.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,933
That's right.
Your childhoods last happy gasps of 

9
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,990
excitement will be drowned out by the 
plump,

10
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,300
plump up dirt,
slowly encasing it.

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,343
So get ready to become a hardened 
alcoholic with three mortgages and an 

12
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,764
angry ex wife because I'm here to tell 
you that the lion king is actually 

13
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:43,880
cinemas.
Cutest advocacy of totalitarian ethics.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,863
Welcome this wise crack condition on the
lion king and as always spoilers ahead 

15
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:48,974
but seriously wasn't seen as the movie.
While the lion king is one of the most 

16
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,304
beloved films of the Disney Cannon,
the Animal Kingdoms political landscape 

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,260
also happens to be eerily similar to 
some of the worst ideologies of not only

18
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:03,500
the 20th century,
but arguably of all time.

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,180
The Lion King tells the story of Simba a
young lion or Dane to succeed his father

20
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,014
move Fossa as king of the pride lands.
Mufasa teaches his young son all about 

21
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:13,664
proper rulership and the delicate 
balance of nature that a king must 

22
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:17,300
uphold.
However,

23
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,850
Mufasa as brothers scar covets the 
throne gets moved,

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,713
Fossa killed and convinces the young 
Simba that it's all his fault before 

25
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:28,184
claiming the throne for himself.
Some lives out his shame with some 

26
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:31,454
carefree hippies before returning to the
pride land to reclaim his rightful 

27
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,210
throne.
Also,

28
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,130
it's based on hamlet.
If the lion king,

29
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:40,400
we're just the story of a king,
his prints and a jealous brother.

30
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,580
There wouldn't be much to say,
but it isn't just that.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,593
In fact,
the film posits two principles which 

32
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,024
have been justifying the world's worst,
desperate since before despots even 

33
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,074
existed.
The first is seemingly the most 

34
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:53,684
wholesome at the beautiful balance of 
nature is the basis for politics or as 

35
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:57,914
the film memorably calls it.
The film's famous opening number 

36
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:08,430
displays the majestic nature of the 
African Savanna and the glorious natural

37
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,264
order of things we Fossa establishes 
that pride rock is run on basic natural 

38
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,050
tenants.
Everything the light touches is all

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,993
a king's time.
As ruler rises and falls like the sun 

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,223
hell,
the sky opens up and shines a halo over 

41
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:26,984
move fosters newborn son.
The heavens literally marking the lions 

42
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,374
as the rightful natural rulers.
The imagery couldn't be any clearer if 

43
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:36,170
they tacked on a Kyron stating obey,
move Fossa.

44
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,213
And while you may wonder what it means 
for a society that is ruled by someone 

45
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:43,130
like a lion who eats his subjects,
don't worry.

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,020
The circle of life is beautiful.

47
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,010
Yes,
but let me explain.

48
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,503
When we die,
our bodies become the grass and the 

49
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:53,804
antelope eat the grass.
And so we owe connected in the great 

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,430
circle of life,

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,070
even though to be more scientifically 
accurate,

52
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,090
it's more likely that for the antelope,
at least they're fully digested.

53
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,924
Brothers and sisters will be excreted by
the likes of Simba to fertilize the 

54
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,340
grass,
which they'll eat.

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,460
So it's like cannibalism with extra 
steps.

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,593
And while it seems like a message that 
even an environmentalist could get on 

57
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,980
board with,
this is where it gets dark.

58
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,083
All the monkeys,
elephants and giraffes seem to happily 

59
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,670
accept their place in society,
hailing the birth of a creature that may

60
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,504
very well eat them one day even move is 
faithful servant quickly gets over the 

61
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,080
fact that he's assaulted and humiliated 
as prey because well,

62
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,230
he is praying,
but not everyone is happy with their lot

63
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,540
in life.
The hyenas are at the bottom of the food

64
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,610
chain,
presumably because they're scavengers.

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,610
You're looking at you guys,
and when we're dangling at the bottom of

66
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,820
the food chain,
it's clear that hyenas aren't welcome in

67
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,600
pride rock.

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,510
So they'd been relegated to starve in an
elephant graveyard.

69
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,583
So that's principle one,
that there is a natural order to things 

70
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,004
that must be adhered to.
Those who are at the bottom of the food 

71
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,930
chain must accept their place for the 
greater good.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,890
This whole vision of rulership as 
maintaining harmony is not new.

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,873
It was advocated by Plato,
but according to philosopher Karl 

74
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,560
Popper,
also known as k pop,

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,750
it's pretty much responsible for 
everything.

76
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,584
Terrible.
That's happened in western history 

77
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,950
sense.
Popper calls this general framework,

78
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,933
whole Islam,
the idea that the whole of a society is 

79
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,904
more important than the individual and 
what's good for society is usually 

80
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:29,230
defined by some in controvertible law,
whether it be natural order,

81
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,540
racial purity,
or the laws of history.

82
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,763
Popper explains that for Plato to keep 
one's place is a virtue and popper goes 

83
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:37,684
on to explain that in this view of the 
world and individual's goal is to be a 

84
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,240
perfectly crafted cog in the great 
clockwork of societal.

85
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,450
Different cogs will have different 
roles,

86
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,284
but the virtue of keeping one's place 
will be common to all of them and it 

87
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,390
will the same time be the virtue of the 
hole.

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,433
That of being properly fitted together,
of being in harmony to this universal 

89
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,290
principle,
Plato gives the name,

90
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,670
justice,
justice,

91
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:01,780
justice,
justice,

92
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,070
justice,
justice,

93
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,933
justice.
This theory of justice popper argues is 

94
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:06,754
totalitarian morality.
In a nutshell if the individual is 

95
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,234
simply a cog than ethics is nothing but 
how to make them fit there and to get 

96
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,050
all historical popper pointed out that 
Plato,

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,440
a dennison of Athens seem to have a 
boner for Sparta,

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,393
which when you think about it is a cruel
eugenics driven military dictatorship 

99
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,983
and for popper,
Plato's politics have been ruining the 

100
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,300
world ever since.
Inspiring everyone from petty tyrants to

101
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,134
big,
bad totalitarian nightmares to break 

102
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,920
this harmony for plato would be chaos or
more specifically democracy.

103
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,963
No,
seriously,

104
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,803
Plato's whole view of democracy was that
it gives the right to rule to those who 

105
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,790
have no business in doing so,
the poor,

106
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,624
the landless and the stupid sound like 
anyone we'll call this scary principle 

107
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:52,984
1.5
because it fits into the larger holism 

108
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:55,714
piece.
Democracy for Plato is a sort of catch 

109
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,610
22 where sure all the people are equal 
and free to do whatever they like,

110
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,400
but because most people are self 
interested,

111
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,234
dicks society will quickly collapse as 
everyone pursues their own shortsighted 

112
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,230
goals.

113
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,790
There's no food,
no water,

114
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,600
it's dinner time or we ain't got no 
stinking entrees.

115
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,513
In a democracy.
The lower class grows bigger and more 

116
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,990
emboldened.
They break the law with impunity,

117
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:20,824
run naked in the streets and then form 
their own youtube channels or whatever 

118
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,480
the equivalent was back then.
Now listen,

119
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:26,314
I'm not here to say that we should all 
collectively worship at the altar of 

120
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:32,170
democracy and freak out whenever there's
a well reasoned criticism of it.

121
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,630
It's certainly not an infallible system.

122
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,910
I like him.
He looks me in the eye.

123
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,213
I'm like

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,750
beer with him.
I'm voting for him,

125
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,643
but well,
there's a difference between reasonable 

126
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,330
criticism and pro authoritarian 
propaganda.

127
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,420
Scar in the hyenas aren't exactly out 
for democracy,

128
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,130
but they are out for equal footing.

129
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,240
A new way in which lie on and Hyena come
together in our grapes,

130
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,393
been relegated to the pride lands 
equivalent of New Jersey where they're 

131
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,760
doomed to star.
They're being manipulated by scar.

132
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:07,594
Who wants to be king for his own ends?
And this mirrors the way as Plato 

133
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:11,854
predicts democracy and never bubbly ends
in tyranny with demagogues making false 

134
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,650
promises to the poor and hungry.

135
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,310
Hi,
why don't make hay strict quit on me.

136
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,750
Scar fully embodies plato's 
quintessential tyrant per play.

137
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,130
Doh eight hybrids is the worst type of 
man,

138
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,173
a man so consumed by his own lawless 
desires that he will do anything to 

139
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,190
achieve them even murder.

140
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,260
No.
Yeah.

141
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,340
When you have tyrants who have not 
achieved internal harmony,

142
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,860
they go d harmonizing everything around 
them.

143
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,760
When scar takes control of pride rock 
for some inexplicable reason,

144
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:57,300
the rivers run dry and the bright lush 
pride lands are reduced.

145
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:02,301
Weight bearing gray wasteland and scar 
is supposed to be the smart one and he's

146
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,760
absolutely right.
If the pride lands are suffering,

147
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:09,030
it's because scar has usurped the 
natural order of things.

148
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,700
And if you dare question your natural 
lot in life,

149
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,683
well you must be a villain.
It's an argument that would be well 

150
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,610
received in the halls of any monarchy or
a dictatorship.

151
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,570
And to bring abundance back to his 
homeland symbols,

152
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,370
ghost ad reminds him to restore the 
natural or

153
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,790
takes your place in the circle of the 
rice

154
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,350
and like magic.
Once Simba sends the usurper scar to his

155
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:31,184
death,
rejuvenating rains fall on the pride 

156
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,780
lands bringing abundance and prosperity.
Once again.

157
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:41,710
The second

158
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,020
more creepy principle.
The film is spouses.

159
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:47,050
Is One less associated with Plato and 
more?

160
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,740
Well,
every sociopath ever might makes right.

161
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,843
This dismal view of society holds that 
all morality isn't governed reason or 

162
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:56,784
the exchange of ideas,
but brute force and weirdly the film 

163
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,840
just seems to go right out there and 
admit it as hot as brains go.

164
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:08,100
I got the lion's share,
but when it comes to blue to strengths,

165
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,170
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the
gene who scars.

166
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,660
Intelligence is connected to his 
deceitful illness,

167
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,870
whereas his brother strength is 
connected to his nobleness.

168
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,733
This view is a favorite of not only Nazi
Germany but pretty much any country 

169
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,440
trying to invade this out if their 
weaker neighbors.

170
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,453
So what do you guys think?
Have we successfully ruined your 

171
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,020
childhood or how have we gone straight 
for the tin foil hats?
