1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,400
Of course it will depend on which cities
were talking about.

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,773
Um,
I think that we will see variations 

3
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,800
between different parts of the world and
different parts of the United States.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,173
I would,
my prognosis is that the biggest game 

5
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,891
changer in the future of cities by 2050 
will be the technology at the moment,

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,140
which is rapidly erupting in 
connectivity.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,750
Um,
you know,

8
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,584
and often it often occurs to me that a 
lot of the travel that we do in our 

9
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,770
current environment is not travel that 
we really want to do.

10
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:57,771
It's because we work somewhere distant 
from where we live.

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,660
And I would like to think that in the 
cities in 2050 generally,

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,240
each area of a,
a large city,

13
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:07,074
it will become more community based.
So there'll be a lot more options for 

14
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,930
people not to have to move around in the
first place.

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,453
So rather than commute 20 or 30 miles 
across a big city will have the 

16
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:21,540
opportunity to do a lot of our work.
Maybe not all of it,

17
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,300
but a lot of our work quite close to 
where we live,

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,583
uh,
that we need to get away from the idea 

19
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
that we live in large dormitory areas.
And then we have all of our work in 

20
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:36,870
industry and a office space and another 
area.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,753
There are plenty of good examples of how
you can mix a mixed the zones up and 

22
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:47,670
still make a very livable and enjoyable 
environment for people to live in.

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,410
So rather than a commute being a couple 
of hours out of every day,

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,603
uh,
maybe a commute means just a couple of 

25
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,573
minutes.

26
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,070
Ooh,
that's more difficult to,

27
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,293
that's more difficult to say.
I think if the human race is still 

28
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,370
around in a hundred years,
uh,

29
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,263
it means that we have,
we've been hung very much over the edge 

30
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:18,540
of the cliff and we have,
we'll have got good at a lot of things.

31
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,740
I think,
uh,

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,590
I think even maybe by 20,
50,

33
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,930
uh,
I mentioned it a little before,

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,650
we will probably be moving goods a lot 
less and food we will be needing to grow

35
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,650
a lot of the food and the goods that we 
consume.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,933
Uh,
we need to produce that much more 

37
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,764
locally to where we live rather than 
divorcing it from the cities need to 

38
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,280
become more integrated.
And the same with work.

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,430
Uh,
I think that would be far more community

40
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,710
based.
In some ways it will require us to,

41
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,010
to go backwards a little.
Maybe it will be living in smaller,

42
00:02:56,011 --> 00:03:00,010
but at the same time,
much more desirable living spaces.

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,480
Uh,
we will,

44
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,890
I mean,
it's just,

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,850
it's so difficult to predict what 
technologies will have available.

46
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:11,410
And I'm in 90 years time,
it's difficult enough in 50 years time,

47
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:16,411
but so it's really difficult to say.
So if we've got cities and 2100,

48
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,143
uh,
makes me very optimistic that we'll be 

49
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,320
still around,
we'll be,

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,303
if we're still around,
it means we figured out how to do a lot 

51
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,690
of things much better than we're doing 
now.

52
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,524
Yeah.
