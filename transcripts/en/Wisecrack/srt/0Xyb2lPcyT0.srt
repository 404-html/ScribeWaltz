1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,690
Good evening,
my name is looking.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,650
My daughter and ever struggled,
ballsy,

3
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:11,170
so I'm sorry if I sound weird or look 
weird,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,750
but my question to you was on cold 
fusion,

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,613
was it something that actually had 
married or was it something that the 

6
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:18,304
scientific community legitimately had 
reasons for abandoning your thoughts 

7
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:23,404
please.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,790
Low key,
low key,

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,390
low key.
You don't look that weird to us,

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,620
sir.
He looked fine about cold fusion,

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,463
so here was the idea.
There's a guy who really had the first 

12
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:38,171
patent on television was the mythic.
This was really his name,

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,423
Phylo Farnsworth,
and it is said he told people that he 

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,344
had the idea for television by plowing 
his uncle's potato field as a as a kid 

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,470
and he looked at the way the the furrows
went across the field and inferred.

16
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,840
That would be a way to make a moving 
picture.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,213
That same guy got it in his head that he
could make neutrons do whatever he 

18
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:08,654
wanted,
like he had this one success and he got 

19
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,104
it in his head that he could influence 
neutrons and he created a device which 

20
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:17,024
he called a phaser and that that word 
has later been used to describe a 

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,140
rotating vectors in electrical and light
waves and a heatwaves.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,551
But,
uh,

23
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:33,551
this thing was going to enable neutrons 
to fuse together at room temperature.

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,730
He was not able to do it.
I mean this.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,730
In order to do that,
as far as we can tell right now,

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,300
you need the gravity of a star,
which we have at our nearby star,

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,913
the sun.
And people have speculated that you 

28
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:54,980
could also contain fusion.
Not speculated that's an exaggerated,

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:59,060
that's a I'm shortchanging us.
People have shown that you could contain

30
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:01,790
fusion in May,
in a magnetic field,

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,530
a very,
very strong magnetic field,

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,863
but no one has been able to build a 
magnetic field powered by the fusion 

33
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,344
reaction.
That makes the fusion reaction makes 

34
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,444
enough power to,
to establish the magnetic field is 

35
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,800
strong enough to hold it so that 
everyone,

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,753
in my experience growing up,
it's always 40 years from now when this 

37
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,650
will be done.
But,

38
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,420
uh,
recently,

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,950
uh,
an aircraft company,

40
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,370
I guess it was Mcdonald Douglas claimed 
or yeah,

41
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,204
Mcdonald's claimed that they'd be able 
to make fusion happen at room 

42
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:39,500
temperature.

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,300
I'm very skeptical because they look at 
what happens in nature with these stars,

44
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,660
but it's so far cold fusion was a myth.
Now then about 25 years ago,

45
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,020
1988,
1990 scientists at a,

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,180
at a university in the State of Utah 
here in the US,

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,290
thought they had established cold 
fusion,

48
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
that they had established a magnetic 
field powered by the energy of the 

49
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,540
fusion that would contain the reaction,
but they didn't.

50
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,840
They had the thermometer in the wrong 
place on their lab equipment.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,273
And,
uh,

52
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,373
I cite this as an example of journalists
who were not scientifically literate 

53
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,540
enough to question this.
This result was published.

54
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,320
Results are announced result and they 
just let the thing,

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,213
the journalists let the things spiral 
out of control to the point where the 

56
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:37,570
story to the point where somebody like 
you 25 years later is asking essentially

57
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,760
the same question,
can we have fusion at room temperature?

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,820
So as far as we know,
no.

59
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,923
However,
it is reasonable that you will be alive 

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,360
when people really do figure it out.
It's exciting.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,400
It's a very.
It's a great question.
