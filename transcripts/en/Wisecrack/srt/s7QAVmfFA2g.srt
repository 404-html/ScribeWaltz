1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,870
Hey,
wise crack,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,090
jared here.
We saw coco last week,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,180
every one cry,
and then once we got past that God awful

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,400
frozen short film,
they were all good tears.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,750
Coco is a film filled with color,
both literally and in it's authentically

6
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,584
rich portrayal of Mexican culture,
but aside from the heartstring tugging 

7
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,454
moments and gorgeous animation,
it also presents a really interesting 

8
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:26,250
perspective on death that we don't often
see in cinema.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,283
Will come this quick.
Take on cocoa and prepare for major 

10
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,750
spoilers.
Also,

11
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,584
warning,
I'm going to put your all the Mexican 

12
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,900
names.
I'm a Gringo Sumi first or recap seven.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,773
Mexico young Miguel Rivera loves music 
and wants to play guitar like his hero 

14
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,320
or nested dela Cruz,
but music is banned in the Rivera family

15
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,154
since his great,
great grandpa left his family to pursue 

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,170
a career in music.
After Miguel steals dela Cruz,

17
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:50,004
his guitar on Dia de Los Muertos,
he's transported to the realm of the 

18
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,100
dead.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,933
Believing dela Cruz is his great,
great grandfather Miguel ventures to 

20
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:00,300
find him in hopes of receiving his 
blessing to return to the living world.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,970
Getting to this mega celeb is a hell of 
a challenge,

22
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,804
but luckily his new pal hector agrees to
help him in exchange for putting up 

23
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,464
Hector's photo on his family's,
a friend of a shrine with pictures of 

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,353
our dancestors so he's not forgotten and
is able to visit the land of the living 

25
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,114
to see his daughter.
Stuff happens and it turns out that 

26
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,710
Miguel's great,
great grandfather is not Ernesto,

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,663
but hector,
who's beloved daughter is Miguel's 

28
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,250
great.
Grandmother,

29
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,580
Coco dela Cruz,
murdered hector stole his songs,

30
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,414
his guitar,
and ultimately his chance to be 

31
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:32,250
remembered by his family.
Miguel returns to the land of the living

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,143
sparks,
Coco's memory of her father by singing 

33
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,543
protectors.
Picture on the agenda and they all live 

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,363
or die happily ever after,
as evidenced by the number of hipster 

35
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,220
sugar skull tattoos I see in Los 
Angeles.

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,293
Many Americans are fascinated by dia de 
los muertos and Coco isn't the first 

37
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,880
animated film that makes use of that 
setting.

38
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,163
In 2014,
Twentieth Century Fox put out a movie 

39
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,880
called the book of life,
which also features a boy who was shoes.

40
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,714
Family tradition to pursue music is 
transported to the land of the dead on 

41
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:00,954
Dia de los Muertos and requires the help
of his ancestors to return to the world 

42
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,824
of living.
Even though these films feature similar 

43
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,224
plots,
they couldn't be more different and 

44
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,294
their portrayal of debt in the book of 
Life Minolos dead ancestors basically 

45
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,524
exist only to assist in his journey and 
give the producers and excuse to cast 

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,770
ice cube in your story that is presented
as something static once your dad.

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,710
That's it.
If you're remembered by your family,

48
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,570
you get to party and if you're 
forgotten,

49
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,930
you're a sad sack,
but either way you're dead.

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,003
Coco elevates this concept by 
introducing a second kind of death 

51
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,424
beyond the biological be symbolic death 
of being forgotten once there's no one 

52
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,764
alive who remembers you,
you disappeared from the land of the 

53
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,700
dead,
passing away a second time.

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,893
That second death is brought on solely 
through relationships to others in 

55
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:52,794
cocoa.
It's People's memories that mark the 

56
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:54,864
difference between life and debt,
and interesting way to think about this 

57
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,100
is through the lens of philosophers.
John Beaudry,

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,320
who talks about death as a kind of 
social relation,

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,633
the Western cultural understanding of 
death has been filtered through science 

60
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,210
to the point where we now think of death
as a primarily biological phenomenon.

61
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,760
Once your heart stops and your fingers 
start rotting,

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,833
your dad,
boatyard compares this to certain non 

63
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,654
Western cultures in which death has a 
symbolic relation of exchange with the 

64
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,270
living in these cultures,
not only his death,

65
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,060
something both given and received by the
living,

66
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,460
but the dead can give and receive as 
well.

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,743
Cocoa Explores this system of mutual 
exchange between the living and the 

68
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,194
dead.
Miguel needs the help of his relatives 

69
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,550
to return to the land of living,
but they need his help as well.

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,563
Hector makes a deal with Miguel to bring
his photo to the a friend that in 

71
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,120
exchange for his assistance in getting 
home and on Dia de los Muertos,

72
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,700
the other living characters interact 
with their ancestors.

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,593
Despite not being able to see them that 
eat the grave sites bring offerings and 

74
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,910
authentically honor those who have 
passed.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,073
It's only the exchange that occurs on 
Dia de los Muertos that prevents the 

76
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:56,404
dead from experiencing the second,
honestly way more terrifying death that 

77
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,720
happens when you're no longer 
remembered.

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,793
Boatyard says that in most western 
societies that kind of two way exchange 

79
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:08,740
between the living and the dead doesn't 
exist.

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,813
The dead aren't a group that the living 
interact with and the more society is 

81
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:13,804
obsessed with rationality,
the less of a role dead people play 

82
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,643
among the dead people we do remember we 
put them on money and on posters and 

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,184
learned about them in history class,
but we don't think of it in terms of a 

84
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,130
relationship.

85
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,120
We don't expect anything from the dead 
and we don't offer them anything either.

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,880
Even the idea of this sounds pretty 
wild,

87
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,990
but this removal of the dead from our 
social interactions changes the shape of

88
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,240
a culture.
Eventually Boatyard says,

89
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:39,340
when the dead don't interact with the 
living,

90
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,323
they become obliterated.
We see this obliteration in Coco when 

91
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,674
individuals stop existing once they no 
longer have living relatives to 

92
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:47,974
participate in that exchange of 
remembrance and celebration and Care 

93
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:51,941
Church,
our own,

94
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,774
the only person we witness experiencing 
that second death doesn't leave a body 

95
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,080
behind the way he certainly did in his 
biological dad.

96
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,183
His skeleton fades and all that slept.
Defendant is a guitar and a bunch of 

97
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,130
junk in a Hammock,
but while memory might be enough to save

98
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:06,964
the dead from permanent extinction,
they suffer when they aren't able to 

99
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,770
return to the living and interact with 
their family.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,120
Just had a really hard the other night.
Could we be using them equal right now?

101
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,043
Memory matters,
but the living have to be willing to 

102
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,160
give something more than that.
For Baudrillard.

103
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:21,994
This give and take between life and 
death would mean that dying and being 

104
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,684
born are not necessarily opposites.
They're part of this big system of 

105
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:29,974
exchange as well,
and death can be traded for live via 

106
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:33,464
social interactions,
and although he's not talking about 

107
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:37,210
Coco,
although we wish he was,

108
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,193
hector's shift from being forgotten to 
being celebrated among his descendants 

109
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,973
is in a sense a kind of rebirth.
Although he hadn't quite crumbled into 

110
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,860
dust yet.
He's at risk of being obliterated.

111
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:48,694
The moment coco forgets him and the 
spark of her memory brings him back to 

112
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,480
life.
Even though biologically he's still dead

113
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,490
as a doornail.
When Coco herself eventually dies,

114
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,010
she's reunited with her parents in the 
land of the dead.

115
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,053
She's their child again.
Even though she looks about twice their 

116
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,564
age combined with them,
she makes her journey back to the land 

117
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:08,654
and living for their yearly visit.
The fruitful exchange of Dia de los 

118
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,373
Muertos still involves cocoa,
but now from the other side of your 

119
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,613
friend up,
there is a reason that people cry when 

120
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,640
Miguel sings.
Remember me at the end of the film.

121
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,180
It's a moment of connection between Coco
and her long gone father,

122
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,660
but it's also a command to all of us,
not to forget the dead.

123
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,380
The performance of the song brings 
symbolic life back to hector,

124
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,453
but the words of the song itself 
celebrate the importance of life beyond 

125
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,684
death.
For a kids movie that's pretty damn 

126
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,500
profound.
Although coming from Pixar,

127
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,334
we wouldn't expect anything less.
Coco gives us all the good stuff's 

128
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,100
sweeping musical scores and shots so 
colorful.

129
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,160
It's like shooting up a box of Crayola 
is,

130
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,123
but it also makes us think is true death
when your heart stops beating or when 

131
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,534
there's nothing left,
if you in people's memories is the mark 

132
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:56,630
you leave on the world.

133
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,960
Really it's own kind of immortality.
Thanks for watching guys.

134
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,630
I hope you love Coco as much as we did.
Piece.

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,033
