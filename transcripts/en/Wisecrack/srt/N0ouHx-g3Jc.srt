1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,070
What's up wise?
Crack,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,913
jared.
Again,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,783
Jurassic world,
fallen kingdom has been absolutely 

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:10,650
obliterated by critics and audiences 
alike.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,390
Calling out it's unfunny character's 
lack of originality and worst of all,

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,390
the unforgivable sin of not enough cif 
gold flute.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,583
Now there's a lot to be said about how 
the latest Jurassic movies haven't 

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:26,250
amazed us in the same way that 
Spielberg's 1993 original did,

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,173
but at least Jurassic world seemed 
somewhat aware of its inherent 

10
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,950
shortcomings.
Let's be honest,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,400
no one's impressed by a dinosaur,
but the Jurassic world follow up.

12
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:41,070
Falling Kingdom shows how far the 
franchise has fallen on paper,

13
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:41,904
though it actually seems to have 
something going for it because unlike 

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,474
it's 2015 predecessor,
the movie actually tries to develop the 

15
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,850
underlying moral question of the 
original.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,300
It moves from,
should dinosaurs be brought back to life

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,283
too?
Should we consciously let dinosaurs go 

18
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,164
extinct again?
No one can deny that fallen kingdom 

19
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:01,104
looks absolutely stunning at times,
but despite the magicians of dollars 

20
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:09,840
thrown at the special effects budget,
the movie is still so boring.

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,600
So why aren't we more immersed than 
ever?

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,643
Well,
let's find out in this wise crack 

23
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,530
condition on Jurassic world,
fallen kingdom.

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,860
What went wrong?
And spoilers ahead if anyone cares.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,053
Let's briefly recap.
For those of you who've already left 

26
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:23,754
this movie go extinct in their minds 
after the destruction of Jurassic world 

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,110
at the closet,
the in dominous rex,

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,500
the dinosaurs are left to run the island
freely once more.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,753
However,
fast forward three years and a volcano 

30
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,214
on the island is about to blast little 
foot and ducky into extinction once 

31
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,110
again.
Oh and then claire,

32
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,640
don't lie,
you forgot their names too.

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,533
Don't want this to happen.
And join a rescue team in an effort to 

34
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,474
save as many of the species as they can.
So the stage is set presenting us with 

35
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,634
perhaps the most action packed high 
stakes situation and Jurassic Park 

36
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,864
history while simultaneously evoking the
main ethical and moral questions that 

37
00:01:58,621 --> 00:01:59,460
made the original.

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,293
So beloved,
should we take responsibility for our 

39
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:06,060
own creations and save the dinosaurs 
from their second extinction?

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,073
Or should we bow down to mother nature 
and let the volcano deal with our 

41
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,840
incompetence once and for all?
So let's see what we got here.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,270
Developing themes from the original 
check,

43
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,373
sweet digital effects and action check.
Everyone's favorite killing machine 

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,830
check.
So what could possibly go wrong?

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,783
Life finds a way by contrast,
the original Jurassic Park came out 25 

46
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:33,120
whole years ago in a time when CGI was 
still in its infancy.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,073
So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the
handful of computerized dinosaurs 

48
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:40,860
featured in the original aren't exactly 
up to par with today's CGI.

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,143
So why is it then that the age action 
sequences in Jurassic Park still feel 

50
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:50,670
more engaging and memorable than the 
visually superior set pieces have fallen

51
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,410
kingdom?
To answer this question,

52
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,244
we need to go back to the man who 
started at all Steven Spielberg and his 

53
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,360
own words.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,193
Spielberg avoided making just another 
monster movie and this was not going to 

55
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,370
be a genre of horror science fiction 
fantasy.

56
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,263
He didn't want Jurassic Park to revolve 
around scary monsters chasing after 

57
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,984
helpless one dimensional characters and 
said he wanted the film to focus on the 

58
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,214
journey of a group of relatable 
characters who have to deal with the 

59
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,950
reality that dinosaurs have been 
suddenly brought back to life.

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,933
For Spielberg,
the original drastic park was a human 

61
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:24,844
story,
not date dinosaurs eating people's 

62
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:29,200
story.
It's not just about the visual spectacle

63
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,080
of witnessing a man getting eaten off 
the toilet by a dinosaur,

64
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,503
but the emotional journeys of the 
characters and it's with this knowledge 

65
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
in mind,
don't be uncover why this is infinitely 

66
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:43,990
less yon inducing.
Then this insanity take for instance the

67
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,824
now iconic t-rex scene in Jurassic Park,
just as our protagonists are passing by 

68
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,040
the enclosure of the king of all 
dinosaurs,

69
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,023
the park's power grid is suddenly turned
off leaving the mighty rex free to go 

70
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,070
wherever she pleases.

71
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,263
The biggest man eating animal in the 
world escapes and our protagonists are 

72
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,374
the first pray to cross her path.
What follows is a roughly six minute 

73
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:09,160
action suspense sequence in which our 
protagonist try their best.

74
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,760
Not to.
Getty seems pretty straightforward,

75
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,030
right?
Well,

76
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,923
yes and no.
Even though the characters trying to 

77
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,190
survive is what is literally happening 
on the screen.

78
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,173
It's what's going on under the surface 
that matters from a story perspective 

79
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,640
isn't as much about the introduction of 
the t rex as it is about the protagonist

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,593
Dr.
Alan Grant learning to become a father 

81
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,210
at the beginning of the film,
we're introduced to the idea that Dr.

82
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,043
Grant is not exactly the kind of guy who
lets his nephew when at super smash 

83
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:38,950
brothers.
In fact,

84
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,784
Spielberg really tries to hammer home 
that grant doesn't like kids and would 

85
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,860
rather remain obsessed with the dead 
past.

86
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,260
Then thinking about creating life in the
future,

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,380
you want to have one of those.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,670
We're also briefly notified that Hammons
daughter of the mom of these two kids is

89
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,270
going through a divorce and you telling 
me that Hannah Kinney,

90
00:04:57,271 --> 00:04:59,890
have you gone in to see me?
He had to leave early.

91
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,900
He wants to be with these daughters.
She's getting a divorce.

92
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,734
I understand that.
So even though we're all just anxiously 

93
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,620
waiting to see newman gets skeeted on by
a Deloft,

94
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,454
the source,
the stage is set for the underlying 

95
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,840
theme of the movie family.
Let's head back to that pivotal scene.

96
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,003
Donald,
the only adult in the car with the kids 

97
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,403
suddenly feels his breakfast Burrito 
twirling around in his bowels and 

98
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,810
decides to dip out and head to the 
nearest bathroom.

99
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,063
The kids having been abandoned by yet 
another male authority figure are alone 

100
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,920
and panicking.
Dr.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,800
Grant immediately realizes he has to 
make a decision.

102
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,570
He can either remain still and decrease 
his chances of getting eaten or act in a

103
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,910
selfless,
somewhat fatherly manner.

104
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,150
Alan,
one repression of father instincts zero.

105
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,480
It's moments like this that elevate the 
action from Amir.

106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,920
Will they survive to how will the 
characters grow as they try to survive?

107
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,233
So when good old rexy breaks through her
own glass ceiling at the start of a 

108
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,710
sequence,
it's not just mere spectacle,

109
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,890
it's action in service of character 
growth and theme.

110
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,830
It engages us not just because it looks 
cool,

111
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,220
but because we can relate to the story 
on a personal level.

112
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,840
Jurassic world,
fallen kingdom,

113
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,390
on the other hand,
has almost none of this.

114
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,493
Sure.
At the start of the story were 

115
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,384
reintroduced to be moral and ethical 
questions surrounding the survival or 

116
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
demise of the dinosaurs on the island.
Do dinosaurs deserve the same 

117
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:25,610
protections given to other endangered 
species or should they be left to die?

118
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,780
But we learn next to nothing about the 
internal lives of the protagonists.

119
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,883
So even though its main action set piece
might be visually far more impressive 

120
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,190
than the t rex scene without this 
underlying layer,

121
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,050
what you see is what you get Chris Pratt
running away from dinosaurs and lava.

122
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,740
It might be a feast for the eyes,
but it starves us emotionally.

123
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,933
Let's look at another example from the 
original right after the t rex breakout 

124
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,670
scene,
Alan has to try and save timmy who still

125
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,400
trapped in this car.
Unfortunately for them,

126
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,293
this tree can't hold the cars weight and
it's about the drop and crush our 

127
00:06:59,091 --> 00:06:59,924
protagonists to death in fallen kingdom.
We see a similar action sequence unfold 

128
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:07,910
when Claire and Franklin have to climb a
ladder to escape a hungry dinosaur whose

129
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,970
only barely being held back by a 
dripping wall of lava.

130
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,940
It doesn't seem too different from the 
falling car setup,

131
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,990
right?
Well,

132
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:15,824
the difference here is that this moment,
10 drastic park isn't just a random 

133
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,394
moment for the sake of suspense,
but that it again serves to develop the 

134
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,080
theme of the story.

135
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,460
Just like can you ask,
she asked.

136
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,294
His Dad is affiliate treatments.
Alan is again forced into a position in 

137
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,890
which he has to act as a father in order
to save timmies life,

138
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,023
and even the climax of the sequence with
Alan and timmy miraculously surviving 

139
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,374
the car,
falling down on them serves a purpose 

140
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,583
instead of just being a copout cliche to
trick the audience into thinking that 

141
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,664
the characters have died on the tree.
This moment is used to show the 

142
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:53,750
metaphorical rebirth of Allen like a 
dinosaur from an egg.

143
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,650
He's no longer the dinosaur obsessed 
child diverse man he once was,

144
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,760
but instead has embraced the possibility
of being a future father.

145
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,960
Now that's an action scene packed with 
meaning and yeah,

146
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,770
you probably guessed it.
Falling Kingdom has nothing like this,

147
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,663
like Alan and Timmy Clare and Franklin 
also barely escaped their deaths in the 

148
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:14,810
nick of time.

149
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,643
But that's all there is to it.
Nothing about the characters or their 

150
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:19,724
relationship has changed.
And so there's no meaning to it beyond 

151
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,683
survival.
So what could have been a visualization 

152
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,284
of their inner growth ends up being 
another vapid spectacle since the 

153
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:31,424
characters remained virtually the same.
So the reason why this action scenes 

154
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,224
still grabs us 25 years after its 
inception is not just because it first 

155
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:41,804
introduced us to the t rex,
but because of how it uses action in 

156
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:49,871
service of the underlying story,
it tells two stories at the same time.

157
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,230
One that excites us and add suspense and
one that people can truly relate to.

158
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,423
Combine the two and you have an action 
sequence that engages audiences across 

159
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,370
time,
no matter how prehistoric it's visuals,

160
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,360
all the pieces were there to make a 
thoroughly enjoyable and memorable film,

161
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,403
perhaps equaling or even surpassing the 
original a film with the same sort of 

162
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:11,934
engaging emotional subtext as the 
original combined with the advancement 

163
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,660
in digital effects could have made for 
something truly special.

164
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,673
And yes,
I'm sure some people had a blast 

165
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,900
watching Chris Pratt runaway from 
dinosaurs and giant melting rocks,

166
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,853
but will these scene still truly live on
in the minds of those same people 25 

167
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:32,130
years from now?
Needless to say,

168
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,053
we have doubts,
at least Trev row in Bayona made sure 

169
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,204
that the series wouldn't evolve further 
into a mindless monster movie by 

170
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,730
repeating the same mistake Spielberg 
made in the lost world.

171
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,703
Oh,

172
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,763
if you're sad that all the real 
dinosaurs went the way the fidget 

173
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:51,914
spinner don't be,
there's actually plenty of prehistoric 

174
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:57,110
monsters that's still roam the earth.
And to the best of my knowledge,

175
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,840
none of them will go all newman on you.
Take,

176
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,580
for example,
the great salamander,

177
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:06,290
who for the past 160 million years has 
remained relatively unchanged,

178
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,250
and there is a version of it that's so 
nasty that early American settlers named

179
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,950
it after health fun.
But to learn all about that,

180
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,470
you got to check out the newest video 
from animal logic.

181
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,650
If you love learning about the amazing 
animals we share the planet with,

182
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,540
and I really think you're gonna like 
animal logic,

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,433
Danielle combines her explanatory powers
with her scientific illustrations to 

184
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:25,784
teach you everything you ever wanted to 
know about animals from the antelope 

185
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:30,110
that looked like they're straight out of
star wars.

186
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,350
Two wasps that I honestly never want to 
see in my life.

187
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,170
They're disgusting.
If you love animals as much as I do,
