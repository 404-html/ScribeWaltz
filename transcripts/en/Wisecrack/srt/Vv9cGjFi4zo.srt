00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
This video is brought to you by Wix,
one of wise crack,

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,333
jared again,
and today we're talking about the enemy 

3
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,140
that isn't sure.
Humidity has much time.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,153
That's right.
We're taking a trip back inside the 

5
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:19,180
walls and revisiting attack on Titan.
Before we get started though,

6
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:21,010
a quick shout out to us

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,960
and our first meeting you want attack on
Titan.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,853
We piece together all the German 
sounding names in the vague political 

9
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,104
illusions to say that attack on Titan 
was a show about a concept in political 

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:36,120
theory called the friend enemy 
distinction.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,163
Check that video out,
but the Tldr is functionally that this 

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,030
guy named Carl Schmidt said that friends
and enemies,

13
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,864
right foundational division in politics 
without which some pretty bad stuff 

14
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,710
would happen,
but we mused.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,300
What if the show is a critique of Carl 
Schmitt,

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,760
who by the way is not a nice man and got
caught up with some ad stuff.

17
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,530
And the third also,
we didn't read the Maga,

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,150
and today that critique habit as attack 
on titan is progressed,

19
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,360
it became clear that these stark 
division between enemy and friends,

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,110
I he tightened and human is a pretty 
intense fabrication,

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,120
used to advance a specific agenda.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,313
Seasons two and three,
explore what happens when that 

23
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,684
distinction begins to crumble to,
can we just patch up society and go 

24
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,450
home?
Well,

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,660
not quite.
That's because as the show explores,

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,703
even when the truth is on your side,
society has some great defense 

27
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:39,450
mechanisms to uphold the status quo.
So strap on your odm gear and join us as

28
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,030
we go deep on attack on Titan seasons 
two and three.

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,980
And as always,
spoiled ahead.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,953
First up,
I want to say thank you to our sponsors 

31
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:48,054
over at wix.
Wix is the easiest way to create 

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,040
beautiful professional websites for 
whatever your needs may be.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm actually trying to get onto the 
professional voiceover game.

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,220
So I created a website with wix to 
present all my voice samples.

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,203
So check it out.
I was creating a website for myself and 

36
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:06,720
I wanted a portfolio and cv and I'm a 
total newbie.

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,973
Then I literally started typing and 
there was already a template for 

38
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,660
voiceover artists.
I picked a style I liked,

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,350
and within minutes I was dragging and 
dropping my audio files and Bam.

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,890
Now I have something I'm confident to 
send out to potential clients.

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,310
Establishing yourself as a professional 
in a new space can be daunting,

42
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,144
but I was really surprised by how 
inviting and easy it was to create a 

43
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,190
website that makes it look like I know 
what I'm doing.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,890
So if you're looking to up your game 
before 2019,

45
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,843
go to wix.com/wise
crack or click the link in the 

46
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,660
description to start making your free 
website today and now back to the show.

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,153
Let's start with a quick recap.
Attack on Titan is about the last 

48
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,394
vestiges of humanity hiding out behind 
giant walls to avoid naked man eating 

49
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:51,090
titles,
as you might imagine with giant monsters

50
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:53,520
on the outskirts of your walls are 
pretty rational.

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,230
US versus them structure society.
This is a pretty high risk lifestyle and

52
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:01,150
sure enough titans breakthrough the 
outermost wall.

53
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,403
From there,
things go from dire to downright 

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,160
dystopian and it's up to the scouts,
mankind's outright or strikeforce to get

55
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,430
under control,
but like the city's walls,

56
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,060
the stark division between human and 
tightened doesn't last very long.

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,613
At the end of season one,
the scouts realized that one of their 

58
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,160
own Erin can shape shift between human 
and tightened.

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,463
Also,
he might be able to use his tightened 

60
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,800
power to seal that Pesky hold on the 
outer wall.

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Jonesy and custodian pull customer could
come in on Sunday.

62
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,943
In season two,
a bunch of titans emerge and trap the 

63
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,584
scouts in a castle or fellow scout you 
mirror turns into a titan surprise to 

64
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:43,774
rescue them.
Apparently everyone is a tightened as 

65
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:46,804
bertold and reiner are in fact be 
colossal and armored tightened 

66
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,970
respectively.
They kidnapped Aaron,

67
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:52,804
but the scouts are able to rescue him 
and start laying out their plan to fix 

68
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,434
the wall.
Aaron learns he can control nearby 

69
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:02,710
titans and we learned that this lady,
Krista is actually named Historia,

70
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,810
which is very important.
Then season three happens.

71
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,983
Irwin,
the commander of the scouts stages a 

72
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:11,700
Kuda to top by turning the people 
against the nobles.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,833
Scouts,
Aaron and Historia are kidnapped by his 

74
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:15,210
story,
his father,

75
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,850
the true king broad rice.
They escape,

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,850
but not before rod rice becomes the 
grossest tightened.

77
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:24,450
To date he attacks the city,
but Aaron and Historia kill him.

78
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,590
Cementing Historia as a warrior queen,
the people can get behind.

79
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,783
Finally,
united that people can get back to 

80
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,440
retaking the outer wall.
Okay,

81
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,930
now we're all caught up,
but what do we make of all that?

82
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,340
Well,
as we mentioned,

83
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:39,174
attack on Titan has always been about 
the distinction of being a friend and 

84
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:42,294
enemy and regular speak.
It's the idea that the easiest way to 

85
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:48,090
get society to work together is if 
they're against someone else.

86
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,600
I'll season one showed a whole society 
built around this principle.

87
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,583
Seasons two and three,
explore how people empower knowingly 

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,780
manufacturer this false divide.
As such,

89
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,810
attack on Titan is a show about the flow
of information.

90
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,160
Each episode includes an interstitial 
labeled information available for public

91
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:08,460
disclosure,
which implies a trove of information not

92
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,294
available to the public.
Some of that classified information 

93
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:14,040
includes the titan inside the wall,
brother Nick,

94
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,530
a priest of the wall might know 
something about it,

95
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,250
but he gets got by the interior police 
before we can say too much,

96
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,383
and when a young Irwin talks about some 
of his father's theories on history in 

97
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:24,924
public,
while let's just say that no one has to 

98
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:28,020
worry about waking daddy anymore.

99
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,363
Another critical secret is the fact that
some of these psycho killer titans are 

100
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:36,600
in fact just shape shifting people.
Erin is the first example we meet,

101
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:37,434
but at the end of season one,
we see any shape shift and in season 

102
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:40,824
two,
Yummier Reiner and bertold all 

103
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:43,254
transform.
We even see a town where most of the 

104
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:49,220
population has changed into titans.
Diego,

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,420
of course,
this is a critical secret and one,

106
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,120
the nobles will do anything to keep 
under wraps.

107
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,990
That's just the tip of the 
conspiratorial iceberg.

108
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,360
Behind the already repressive 
government.

109
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,990
There's an even more autocratic system 
that exists in the shadows.

110
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,160
It turns out that the king we thought 
was in charge is just a figurehead.

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
Instead,
the city is ruled by the rice family 

112
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:13,963
currently rod and his Air Storia who 
have the royal blood necessary to 

113
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,490
control the powers of the founding.
Tighten these two,

114
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,540
these Jewish goodwill tonight to shin.

115
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,600
The huc sudden powers like changing the 
memory of the citizens and even creating

116
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:33,130
the walls at old sun juvenile.
No chicana down.

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,393
All of that is happening behind the 
scenes determining the fate of the 

118
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,604
people who have no idea it even exists.
The nobles go to great lengths to keep 

119
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:42,854
the secret government secret.
This includes orchestrating a series of 

120
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:48,260
attacks with the dual goals of 
kidnapping,

121
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,094
Aaron and Historia for the sake of broad
Rice's plan and framing the scouts for 

122
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,890
acting against humanities interests.
They'll go,

123
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,641
go,
go,

124
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,900
go,
and now you're calling.

125
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,320
Let me then Joseph Heron on the auto.
Cool.

126
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,230
Why frame the scouts?
Because between seeing several different

127
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,064
people turn into titans,
they realize that the founding myth of 

128
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:09,380
their society,
that titans are unthinking people.

129
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:10,214
Eaters is in fact a lie,
nor does anyone bothered to mention the 

130
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,160
role titans played in constructing the 
walls that defined the world for most of

131
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:22,994
humanity.

132
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,593
God,
almost every choice the show makes is 

133
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,060
premised on the withholding or discovery
of information,

134
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,970
Vanilla data that Ada,
Ada will,

135
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,520
and I have a dovetail Shinju.
That idea is so central to the show.

136
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,530
It's embedded into the narrative 
structure.

137
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,400
Attack on Titan is a mystery box show 
where the primary driving force,

138
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,273
the narrative is moving from one secret 
to the next rather than moving along 

139
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,790
narrative arcs.
It's a difficult balance,

140
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,630
but so far the show has pulled it off by
putting the audience in the scouts shoes

141
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,530
just as Aaron and Co have to decide who 
to trust and what to believe.

142
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,510
So do we.
As we watch,

143
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,670
the more we learn,
the more we understand,

144
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:08,120
but the more questions we have and same 
with the scouts,

145
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,180
but this doesn't mean people are kept 
totally in the dark.

146
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,373
Rather the information people do get is 
designed to lead them to conclusions 

147
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,770
that support the system as is key to 
that end.

148
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:24,290
There is a newspaper that provides 
information to the population.

149
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,050
Unfortunately the only report what the 
interior police tell them they should to

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,913
old companion.

151
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,283
This process of giving people enough 
information that they don't bother to 

152
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:36,914
question the structure,
providing it or the world they live in 

153
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:44,230
is described by scholar Hamid Dabashi as
epistemic and docmosis were older models

154
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,464
of government,
assumed the lower classes were 

155
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:47,750
unthinking,
illiterate,

156
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,060
idiots who wouldn't even know what to do
with the truth.

157
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,253
Dabashi argues that power can be 
solidified by providing bad information 

158
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,790
to the thinking and literate people with
the world,

159
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,070
the boss.
She explains that this is information to

160
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,100
consume,
not questioned for the more.

161
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:04,860
It's not meant to generate a coherent 
body of knowledge,

162
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:05,694
but is instead single serving meant to 
induce action for a specific event and 

163
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,484
attack on Titan.
We see this in the form of state 

164
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,830
propaganda and city newspapers.
They give people enough information that

165
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,090
they feel like they're making decisions 
when instead they're being manipulated.

166
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,040
Now,
while in the real world,

167
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,874
this kind of epistemic in Moses 
generates new knowledge on demand for 

168
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,180
whatever benefits those in power want on
a given day.

169
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,363
It has a pretty singular purpose and 
attack on Titan to maintain the myth of 

170
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:35,784
the Titan as outsider monster.
That story enables those in power to 

171
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,074
justify almost any action in the name of
defending the people from the monsters 

172
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,200
outside the walls,
actions like rationing food,

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,190
limiting people's movements in a mule 
non pod,

174
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,500
more you get,
and even attempting to execute Irwin who

175
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,343
was a goddamn hero,
but why lie about the titans in the 

176
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,810
first place?
Well,

177
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:01,650
it varies from character to character,
but there are two main reasons,

178
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,560
power and belief,
as for power.

179
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,453
The city with a three wall designed to 
protect against Titan attacks also 

180
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,120
happens to be based on a strict class 
structure that enables the nobles,

181
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,043
cushy lifestyle.
They worked to perpetuate a stratified 

182
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,674
city suffering for resource shortages 
and the occasional naked giant incident 

183
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,880
because it's that status quo that keeps 
them in mansions and fancy robes.

184
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,940
When Irwin orchestrates a false alarm 
about a titan attack,

185
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,870
the nobles don't hesitate to bar 
refugees from the inner wall.

186
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,930
Saving notion.
Don't.

187
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,030
No sorry,
used usage job fuck domino's.

188
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,510
Here's the deal.
In this moment,

189
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,373
we see that their interest in the system
has nothing to do with protecting the 

190
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:47,364
people.
It's all about protecting themselves 

191
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,213
without the myths that control society.
Someone might get the thinking that 

192
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,354
having a bunch of disconnected,
rich dudes in charge might be a bad 

193
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,070
idea.
Nice.

194
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,003
You got stuck out to them with data that
Missoula Udi customers a good nomi 

195
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,873
doesn't.
The other more complicated reason is 

196
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,073
belief.
This idea is most clearly manifested in 

197
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,804
the character of rod rice.
Rice sincerely believes that the only 

198
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:18,960
way to protect the people is to use the 
power of the founding titan.

199
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Gluten will come in or she'll take 
decent Olga children.

200
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Issue started to sick I Dakota.so
don't sweat it,

201
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,223
Dave,

202
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,050
even if that means wiping people's minds
in having his daughter eat her friend to

203
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:37,884
become a titan herself of all those 
fancy powers court on Tuesday to do 

204
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,860
connect to Janina.
The dosing can be production.

205
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,930
That power is so crucial to maintaining 
the status quo.

206
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,260
That rice things.
There's no price too high to pay for it,

207
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,570
even his own daughter.
Thus when she rescues Aaron,

208
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,750
he takes the serum himself to try and 
inherit the power,

209
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,480
but it goes awry and he almost kills 
everyone.

210
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,590
What makes this dynamic extra 
complicated is rod didn't always believe

211
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,424
this as a younger man,
he and his brother Yuri wanted to 

212
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,124
destroy all the titans,
but when you're a gained the founding 

213
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,124
titans power,
he changed his mind and concluded that 

214
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,620
only the city could protect them,
no matter the motivation.

215
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,454
The problem with this heifers,
Elos way of thinking is that it turns 

216
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,560
all political questions into ethical 
questions

217
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,240
and you come in with untitled or take 
much

218
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,333
for rod rice,
whether he's trying to destroy all the 

219
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,240
titans or maintaining the myth of the 
Titan.

220
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,930
The stakes are the existence of humanity
theory.

221
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,783
Strong,
tall move explains that when politics 

222
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:47,954
become a referendum on ethics,
beat politics part ceases to exist in 

223
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,874
favor of a battle between us and them.
The process is simple and attack on 

224
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:59,690
Titan.
The status quo is set up as the only way

225
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,524
to protect humanity from the titans.
That means anyone opposed to the system 

226
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,840
represents an existential threat

227
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,723
lighter.
That's what I wanted that Joseph into 

228
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,590
that

229
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,380
and thus they're evil and when it comes 
to evil,

230
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,650
there's no reasoning with it.
The only option is to fight.

231
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,320
For instance,
when the city turns on the scouts,

232
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,970
it's because these former heroes put 
society in danger by questioning dogma,

233
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,013
so the scouts need to be destroyed.
The ultimate existential threats and 

234
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,720
ethical enemy according to the fat cats 
in this district is the titans.

235
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,940
Of course,
we know that's not entirely true.

236
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,670
After the scouts discover Connie's 
village to be empty,

237
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,653
they realized that many of the people,
they're turned into titans including 

238
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:43,344
Connie's mother,
but that doesn't matter in the face of 

239
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:46,464
an ethnicized politics.
When some people or titans are 

240
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,334
determined to be an existential threat,
the idea of understanding them goes out 

241
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,350
the window.
Instead,

242
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,650
it's time to grab the swords and sliced 
some vital areas.

243
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,873
The titans exist as threats to justify 
the status quo and things to destroy as 

244
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,540
a gesture towards safety.

245
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,360
That dynamic is maintained by the 
control of information,

246
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,223
of course,
but that monopoly starts to come apart 

247
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:12,984
on the personal level.
Characters are constantly forced to 

248
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:16,164
choose between promises they made to 
friends or themselves and the broader 

249
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:20,214
life fueled social obligations.
Some characters have no issue rejecting 

250
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,820
the morals provided by society in the 
name of their own beliefs.

251
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,953
For instance,
Historia is unconditionally loyalty 

252
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,703
Humira,
even though she's a type at the same 

253
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:33,444
time.
Erin is driven almost entirely by the 

254
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:37,510
hatred of titans.
Kelsey,

255
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,400
oh,
he standing.

256
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,063
Others are torn between these 
obligations constantly like the 

257
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,810
tightened serving in the scouts.
Birch hold,

258
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:49,380
Reiner and humira vertical and reiner 
loved their fellow soldiers,

259
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:52,280
but are also bound to their duty as 
warriors.

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,233
They're willing to capture Aaron,
but at the same time they do end up 

261
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,414
letting him go.
Then they ended up with the beast 

262
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:03,151
heightened setting a trap for Aaron and 
the scouse Xhosa tools in the tool.

263
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,171
Cool.
Cool.

264
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:09,004
Damn up to Dale Scott or Kudos.
They are pulled in two directions at 

265
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:15,910
once,
constantly switching between the two.

266
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,590
Of course,
nothing in attack on Titan is simple.

267
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:22,000
As the show was saying,
more than sometimes the rules of society

268
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,090
conflict with personal commitment they 
don't need.

269
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,153
Instead,
attack on Titan makes it clear that as 

270
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:32,554
the social structure loses legitimacy,
whether through its failure to protect 

271
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:40,981
the people or it's myths crumbling,
social bonds grow as the scouts discover

272
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:42,394
the truth,
their connection solidify to the point 

273
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,823
of trumping their societal obligation.
That's why they go to rescue Aaron and 

274
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,160
Historia even as society turns against 
them.

275
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,533
Perhaps no other moment illustrates this
point better than Aaron and history is 

276
00:15:55,751 --> 00:16:00,370
confrontation in the cave rod rice has 
aaron chained up and offers his story of

277
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:02,470
the tightened serum.
If she takes it,

278
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,304
she will transform,
eat her friend Aaron and become the 

279
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,500
founding tightened that rod rice 
believes the city needs.

280
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,890
Aaron wants her to do it.
He thinks if she eats him,

281
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,230
she'll be able to not only protect the 
people,

282
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,290
but kill the titans.
Aaron spouts the city's myths.

283
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:26,471
Set the story up to convince her 
secretary to hostile.

284
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,410
Got Kitchen.
Let's cut.

285
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,450
Pick you talk,
but she's not buying it.

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,490
She doesn't believe any of the social 
myths anymore,

287
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,310
not just because she knows the truth of 
the system.

288
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,010
Josie,
you got it,

289
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,603
but she also sees the moral truth.
Any social arrangement that puts her in 

290
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:00,840
opposition to her best friend new mirror
is inherently wrong to her.

291
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,863
Okay.
Want me to $90 so she rejects rob's 

292
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:14,180
plan,
smashes the vial and freeze.

293
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:15,014
Aaron.
Aaron is arguing for the status quo 

294
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,740
while historian believes in the 
possibility of a better different world.

295
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,240
These are the real stakes of personal 
obligation versus the ethics provided by

296
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,074
society.
Personal ethics want to protect the 

297
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:33,380
values of the people while social ethics
are designed to sustain the status quo.

298
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,840
Attack on Titan seasons two and three.
Point two.

299
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:40,841
The dire fact that history can be used 
as a tool to tell the story that ends in

300
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:41,864
the status quo.
That's why it's so important that the 

301
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:44,864
founding titans powers include the 
ability to wipe the memory of the 

302
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,240
population by creating a history that 
fits their needs.

303
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,163
The people in charge are able to 
maintain persistent control of the 

304
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,950
population and give them ethical 
priorities that matched the goals of the

305
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:03,630
system and attack on Titan society is 
sustained by myths.

306
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,613
The powers that be will do anything to 
protect those stories and justify the 

307
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:11,760
status quo against the possibility of 
any other social model.

308
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,690
Gutted.
Dylan.

309
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,500
Cut It on the keynote.
Was she touching?

310
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,600
Okay.
Kendig,

311
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Olivia.
So data that shows that includes killing

312
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:28,500
titans even if they aren't monsters 
after all,

313
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,590
but rather people and during a terrible 
fate,

314
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,840
anything is justified if it means 
keeping society as it is intact.

315
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,230
So what do you think wise?
Crack his attack on Titan.

316
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,620
A lesson on how power works or is there 
something we missed?

Also,
we got some great videos coming out 

320
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,140
before the end of the year,
including ones on.

321
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:57,630
It's always sunny in Philadelphia,
the Justice League,

322
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,720
and one on Jrr Tolkien that we've been 
working on for awhile.

323
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,000
So stay tuned for that.
And until next time,

324
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,163
peace.
