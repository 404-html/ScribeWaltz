Ms,

Whether you need a domain,

3

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,260
A wise crack,
desperately needs a haircut.

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,094
Jared here,
so we just saw black panther and got to 

6
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,914
say it's probably one of the better 
marvel films and the element that 

7
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,980
elevates it is something rarely seen in 
the mcu,

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,083
a complex antagonist,
even the best marvel films feature 

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,610
villains that fit the same generic 
pattern,

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,713
try to take over the world for reasons 
that are rarely more complex than they 

11
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:38,430
are for Pinky and the brain.
Same thing we do every night,

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,660
pinky try to take over the world.
It's just what marvel villains do.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,080
Eagle wants to take over the universe 
because he's egotistical.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,003
Hello,
wants to take over as guard so she can 

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,014
then take over the nine realms and hydro
wants to take over the world because 

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,790
they're literal Nazis,
but killmonger is different.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,580
He's got compelling and relatable 
reasons,

18
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,780
motivating his attempt to global 
conquests.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,750
So much so that we found ourselves 
asking,

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,050
is killmonger the best superhero villain
since the joker?

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,510
Welcome to this wise crack quick take on
marbles.

22
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:11,280
Black Panther,
and as always,

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,980
spoilers ahead,
so what motivates,

24
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,660
kill longer,
simply put,

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,613
he's seeking retribution for the 
injustices leveled against people of 

26
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,124
African descent by Western countries.
This includes the obvious like slavery 

27
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,550
and segregation,
but also other wrongs,

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,443
including redlining in which unfair 
government loan policies for blacks to 

29
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:35,670
live in ghettos and racial profiling by 
police in which increased patrolling and

30
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,510
impoverished black neighborhoods 
contributes to the mass incarceration of

31
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,690
black men in America apply to which 
current Black Panther writer,

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,750
Tanahashi coats often writes about,
and by the way,

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,613
if you're interested in hearing more 
about how coats and other Afro 

34
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,450
pessimistic views are being expressed in
pop culture,

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,660
I recommend listening to the get out 
episode of our movie podcast.

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,493
Show me the meaning anyway.
Though these injustices are only 

37
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,494
obliquely alluded to in the film,
including a humorous bit with sheree 

38
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:05,340
calling Bilbo a colonizer.
They formed the obvious subtext.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,233
Every time killmonger mentions the 
plight of blacks living outside of 

40
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,630
Wakanda apply that will conduct,
could presumably fix,

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,530
and this leads to one of the film 
central questions should Macondo,

42
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,364
do more to address the inequities of the
outside world initially that will 

43
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,264
condoms want to maintain their isolation
is politics and killmonger wants to 

44
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:25,614
conquer the oppressors,
thereby colonizing the old colonial 

45
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,064
powers.
This juxtaposition of isolationism 

46
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,124
versus colonialism is one of several 
false dichotomies introduced by 

47
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,880
killmonger that characterize the 
thematic structure of Black Panther.

48
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,930
So what do I mean by false dichotomy 
throughout the film?

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,793
Killmonger prompts a number of binaries 
such as isolationism versus colonialism 

50
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,110
or traditionalism versus progress,
but as the film ultimately reveals,

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,103
there's no reason to look at these 
issues as a choice between two 

52
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,184
absolutes.

53
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,143
There's usually a third way,
a middle path between two extremes or 

54
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:01,354
what aristotle called the golden mean,
and this golden mean defines to Challas 

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,730
character arc to Cholla grows when he 
learns to avoid the simplistic solutions

56
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,270
at the far ends of the spectrum.
So let's explore these dichotomies.

57
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,283
The first,
it's a question of how to construct a 

58
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,444
group identity,
national identity versus racial 

59
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,744
identity.
The people of will conda are extremely 

60
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
nationalistic.
They view the world is divided into two 

61
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,730
groups,
will competence and everybody else.

62
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,420
This leads to a Wakanda first attitude 
among many citizens.

63
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,910
They've built walls,
refused refugees,

64
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,773
reject trade and offer no foreign aid 
all in the name of protecting Wakanda 

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
because they value the lives of those 
who share the same heritage and culture 

66
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,684
as themselves,
but killmonger having grown up in 

67
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,654
America has developed a strong sense of 
racial identity for him because we'll 

68
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,310
condoms have the same skin color as 
blacks and the rest of the world.

69
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,450
Well condoms should see themselves as 
part of a global black community.

70
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,523
Among the first thing he says when he 
takes the throne is something like all 

71
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,214
around the world,
people that look like us are suffering 

72
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,160
in his speech at the United Nations,
at the end of the film to Cholla rejects

73
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,023
both the Wakandans nationalism and kill 
mongers ethnicity and instead accepts 

74
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,514
the middle road offered by humanism.
He specifically states that all of 

75
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:23,320
humanity is one tribe.
It's a surprisingly colorblind message,

76
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,154
but a welcome one.
The second false dichotomy is 

77
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:30,760
traditionalism versus progress.
For all its technological advancements.

78
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,670
Will conduct is an extremely traditional
society,

79
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,623
regularly engaging in ancient rituals 
such as the combat for the crown or the 

80
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:42,730
ingesting of the heart shaped herb for 
killmonger progress requires getting rid

81
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,564
of traditions such as when he destroys 
the garden of heart shaped herbs and 

82
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,960
refuses to continue the ceremonial 
combat with the cello.

83
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,230
One could even say his philosophy echoes
that of Kylo Ren.

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,170
The middle ground is keeping what 
traditions he can,

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,230
but rejecting what wasn't working 
specifically,

86
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,064
what condos,
isolation and its hostility with the 

87
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,794
Jabari.
The film's final dichotomy is the 

88
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,390
aforementioned isolationism versus 
colonialism.

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,463
Most Wakandans believe continuing their 
centuries old tradition of isolationism 

90
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,680
to be the most prudent path to 
maintaining peace,

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,190
including initially to Cholla.
Killmonger on the other hand,

92
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,670
subscribes to a theory mentioned 
frequently in the film that the world is

93
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:31,504
getting smaller and you're either the 
conquered or the conquerors killmonger 

94
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:35,674
solution that will condoms should take 
part in the same harmful colonialism 

95
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,020
that's afflicted.
Black individuals.

96
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,854
For centuries,
killmonger seeks to repay historic 

97
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,094
injustices,
tit for tat by arming oppress black 

98
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,424
communities around the world with 
advanced weaponry and inciting race 

99
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,684
riots and radical revolution killmonger.
His political philosophy is reminiscent 

100
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,854
of the French revolution,
which was fueled by fantasies of the 

101
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:02,060
oppressed,
exacting revenge upon their oppressors.

102
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,240
Killmonger is desire for vengeance is so
impassioned,

103
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,074
but he seems to give no thought to 
governing after destroying Western 

104
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,094
society.
I like his construction of color and 

105
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,854
race.
This too is a result of his American 

106
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,704
upbringing.
Killmonger story is like that of many 

107
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,813
African Americans,
for whom military service was the only 

108
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:21,794
viable path out of poverty,
and it was the American military which 

109
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,454
trained him in the art of regime,
change his time in the special forces 

110
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,420
having been spent overseeing various 
coups and conquests in the Middle East.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,313
Not only does this result in him being 
more interested in revolution than 

112
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,830
actual rule,
it's also darkly ironic.

113
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
He wants to colonize the so called 
colonizers because that's what the 

114
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:44,954
colonizers taught him to do.
This is part of what makes killmonger 

115
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,360
such a sympathetic villain,
and yes,

116
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,610
he is a villain.
Unlike the Challah,

117
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,473
he doesn't look for the golden mean,
he's an extremist in both his beliefs 

118
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,123
and violent methodologies,
but this extremism is painted as a 

119
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,010
direct result of Western society 
grappling with it's messy.

120
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:09,010
Past killmonger is a dark reflection of 
the sins of our forefathers justice.

121
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,080
He blamed for the actions of his father 
to Chaka.

122
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,800
He blames everyone else for their 
ancestors actions as well,

123
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,750
but to Cholla rejects this when he says 
to them [inaudible],

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,310
that he is not responsible for past what
condon,

125
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,153
kings mistreatment of the Jabari people 
and while to Cholla doesn't deny the 

126
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,264
wrongdoings of westerners past.
He acts without animosity toward their 

127
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,590
present,
a descendants.

128
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,453
It's this optimism which allows to 
challah to chart a course between the 

129
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:39,251
extremes of isolationism and conquest by
the films and to Challah is persuaded by

130
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,364
killmonger that there is a need for 
Wakanda to provide global aid and 

131
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:46,160
assistance just without the violent 
conquest.

132
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,143
The movie closes with the Child Building
and outreach center in Oakland to help 

133
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,280
the people that kill monger was fighting
for,

134
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,460
and that's what makes killmonger is such
a phenomenal villain.

135
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,340
Whereas most bad guys represent a clear 
cut,

136
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,203
evil that must be unilaterally defeated.
Killmonger is disposition is one that 

137
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,094
must be adopted.
Killmonger doesn't just challenge our 

138
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,094
protagonists,
he guides them and provides them with 

139
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,584
the insight team needs to become a truly
great king in the face of very divisive 

140
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:14,984
issues.
The child is able to synthesize these 

141
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,630
solutions in a way that works best for 
Wakanda and the world.

142
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,030
It's like Afro Futuristic,
Hagle.

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,510
Hope you guys enjoyed the movie as much 
as we did and as always,

144

thanks for watching.

145
