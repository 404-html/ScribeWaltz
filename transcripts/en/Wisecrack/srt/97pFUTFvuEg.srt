00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:04,024
with the link in the description.
We'll get their first two months for 

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,000
just 99 cents.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,360
Hey,
wise crack jared.

5
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,194
Again.
While we were working on our philosophy 

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,940
of Savio,
I came across something very unexpected.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,953
Apparently critics have noted a 
structural similarity between the soft 

8
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:25,190
films and French philosopher John Paul 
Sartre is famous play no exit,

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,293
so I watched all seven movies,
read no exit and immediately called 

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:32,030
Bolt.
The connection was too tenuous.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,780
Then Jigsaw came out and when I saw this
I was like,

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,973
Huh,
welcome his wife's crack condition on 

13
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:41,560
the philosophy of Jigsaw and if you want
more jigsaw related content,

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,513
head on over to wise crack plus on 
Patrion for an exclusive podcast that 

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,020
dives deeper into the movie and as 
always,

16
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:50,710
spoilers and decapitations ahead like 
all saw movies,

17
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:51,544
Jigsaw starts with a game.
Each player has to confess the horrible 

18
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,780
sin that snag them and exclusive invite 
to the world's worst warehouse party.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,793
If they don't confess,
they'll turn dead AAF given the chance 

20
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:03,664
to save their skin.
Each of the players take a solid pass 

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,120
offering.
Half-Baked Confession,

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,400
not an accident.
10 minutes after I felt like to work

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,090
professing their innocence Honi my soul 
is clean.

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,940
So one by one they're voted off the 
island.

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
Meanwhile,
an assortment of Sketchy Detectives and 

26
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,704
forensic pathologist try to figure out 
why gnarly corpses keep popping up all 

27
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,880
over the city could the very much dead 
John Kramer Bita blame.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,803
Eventually the film's creepy detective 
and creepy forensics guy come face to 

29
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,464
face in the ultimate creep off and we 
find out that the forensics guy is the 

30
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:47,520
new jigsaw you're working around.
I am man.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,653
Oh and by the way,
everything you just watched actually 

32
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,160
happened 10 years ago.
But don't worry about that.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,210
Instead of focusing on the timeline 
fake-out we're zeroing in on what brings

34
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,580
fans to the soft films in the first 
place.

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,460
I want to play a game.
The wholesome games.

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,330
See in the past,
jigsaw had one main party trick building

37
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:09,600
traps to heinously and creatively 
torture people.

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,553
But in the latest film,
Jigsaw has moved into a more 

39
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,924
psychological realm,
forcing his victims to confess their 

40
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,524
worst sins.
Both versions of the game consist of 

41
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,780
forcing a person to choose between two 
unattractive options.

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,500
There was only one open the decline

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,913
in the first seven films.
Cramer asked each victim to choose 

44
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,854
between door a inflict excruciating pain
on themselves or others or door b give 

45
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,710
up and die,
but in Jigsaw it,

46
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:42,330
the game's been updated.
Now his victims must choose between door

47
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,440
a confessed to their worst sin in front 
of a group of strangers and make it home

48
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:50,400
in time for adult swim or door be die a 
painful death.

49
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,710
While I am sure there is a desire to 
point fingers at me to the blog,

50
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:59,710
that has been shit,
unless you can turn that thing inward,

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
I assure you more blood will be lost.
The game is still sprinkled with head 

52
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,640
gnashing,
leg ripping devices,

53
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,920
et Cetera,
but these are more of a side show,

54
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,040
a background threat perhaps to encourage
honesty.

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,083
The evolution of Jigsaws gain positions,
the act of confessing as the painful 

56
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,810
alternative to death,
the central form of suffering that takes

57
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,910
place in the film.
Unlike the other films,

58
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,920
confession,
not to be burning,

59
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,754
slashing,
or ripping a flesh is treated as the 

60
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,334
harder,
more pain inducing moral alternative to 

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,230
instant death.
But let's backtrack for a second.

62
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,183
What moves jigsaw to devote his life to 
making diy medieval torture devices in 

63
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,210
the first place?
As we explained in our philosophy of saw

64
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,044
episode Kramer shares the early 
Christian view that suffering can be 

65
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:44,794
transformative and even life changing,
so enduring his traps can strengthen a 

66
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:53,170
person's moral character and even redeem
them for past naughtiness.

67
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,153
As leader of this crossfit for the soul,
Jigsaw establishes himself as a godlike 

68
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,494
figure,
imposing his moral agenda on his 

69
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,710
captive.
Similarly,

70
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:06,610
jigsaws new game draws from another 
aspect of early Christianity,

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,593
public confession and public pennants 
wild today centers can spill their guts 

72
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,540
in a low key gossip session with father 
superior.

73
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,010
Third Century centers were frequently 
required to confess their worst deeds in

74
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,910
front of their entire Church 
congregation and act known as Xml,

75
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,744
Jesus,
and also a total bummer according to 

76
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,760
early Christian writer Tertullian.
Excellent.

77
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,594
Well,
Jesus was an act meant to humiliate the 

78
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:30,964
center,
essentially rendering them so totally 

79
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,930
pathetic.
They would move God to mercy.

80
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,093
Likewise,
Kramer demands the confessions of his 

81
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:41,320
captives in hopes of shaming them.
Once confession was over,

82
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,213
the person moved on to public pennants 
where the humiliation only got Richard 

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,913
Tertullian claims the center would be 
instructed by their bishop to do things 

84
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,330
like lions,
sackcloth and ashes.

85
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,060
The ashes were a sign of mourning for 
your peace,

86
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,903
spiritual condition.
They were forbidden to bape and had to 

87
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,300
eat only unseasoned food and drink to 
pass.

88
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,360
The time.
Centers would prostrate or lie stretched

89
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,194
out on the ground,
groaning and crying while begging their 

90
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:10,120
church leader and fellow churchgoers to 
pray for them.

91
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,103
In Jigsaw,
Anna seems to be taking a similarly 

92
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,850
penitent pose as she begs Kramer for 
mercy.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,953
So like a third century church leader,
Kramer demands that his captives 

94
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:25,111
publicly confessed their worst deeds and
boy do they clam up the second cigs.

95
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:30,181
I'll ask them to talk about their past 
in previous installments.

96
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,474
The basic human desire to keep both 
eyeballs has made for a compelling 

97
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:39,721
reason not to follow jigsaws commands.
This time it's just the characters shame

98
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,370
that makes them reluctant to air their 
dirty laundry.

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,220
This creates some decidedly baffling 
moments.

100
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,143
Best exemplified early on when carly 
finds out that Jigsaw has injected her 

101
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,284
with a poison that can only be cured by 
an antidote found in one of these three 

102
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,210
needles.
One is the antidote,

103
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
one is harmless and one holds a potent 
acid that will melt her face off and not

104
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:01,814
in the fund.
Electric Daisy carnival way partly 

105
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,230
figures out which needle would save her 
life because one is numbered.

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,400
3.5300000000000002

107
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,080
what does that mean?
Who worse to me,

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,330
which is the exact amount of money she 
got after robbing and killing someone to

109
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,164
admit that though would serve as a kind 
of confession so she doesn't say 

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,750
anything.
So that happens.

111
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,793
So why wouldn't carly confess?
It seems odd unless you consider the 

112
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:29,924
clue helpfully graffiti tag on the wall.
That sign isn't just there for fire 

113
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,124
safety.
It's a reference to John Paul Sartre is 

114
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:39,560
famous play no exit.
First a quick breakdown of the play.

115
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,573
Three dead souls.
Inez is still and Joseph meetup in hell 

116
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,530
though this version of hell is less fire
and brimstone and more waiting room.

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,513
Wondering how they ended up there.
It's telling Joseph make like the 

118
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,290
solving items and lie about their 
crimes.

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,840
The studio.
Yes.

120
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,970
What have you done?
Where are they send to here?

121
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,870
Well,
that's just it.

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,270
I do know.
In fact,

123
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,790
I'm wondering if there hasn't been some 
terrible mistake.

124
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,830
Eventually each confesses their worst 
deeds.

125
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,490
Both Estelle and Joseph feel the weight 
of judgment for their crimes.

126
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,330
So what does this play have to do with 
your favorite torture porn series?

127
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,403
Both center around a group of strangers 
trapped in a room awaiting an unknown 

128
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:27,630
but presumably horrific punishment.
But perhaps a saw producer was guilty of

129
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:28,464
wikipedia hang himself because the 
eighth film really doubles down on the 

130
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:34,980
no exit shtick in ways,
both big and small.

131
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,933
Notably,
there's an eerie similarity of the 

132
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,770
crimes committed by Sartre's character.
Estelle and Jigsaws.

133
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,490
Anna,
uh,

134
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,190
still after becoming pregnant by her 
illicit lover,

135
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,950
drowned her newborn baby as he looked on

136
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,520
and he could see what I was up to.
He kept on shouting.

137
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,710
It's style for God's sake,
don't he saw it?

138
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,220
Oh,
he was leaning over the balcony.

139
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,910
He sold the ring spreading on the ward.

140
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,710
The words he killed himself in grief.

141
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,710
That is he wished he made.
He blew his brains out.

142
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,180
Similarly,
Anna suffocated her newborn child,

143
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,320
but convinced her husband it was his 
fault forcing him to commit suicide,

144
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,920
but now for the principal's similarity 
between jigsaw and no exit,

145
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,010
the emphasis on the painful nature of 
confession.

146
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,550
Do you understand why confession is so 
hard in both works?

147
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,443
We need to examine sartre idea of the 
look which he illustrates through the 

148
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,374
following example.
Imagine that you're spying on your 

149
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,490
roommates awkward breakup through a 
keyhole.

150
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,563
Suddenly you become aware of that your 
other cooler roommate is down the 

151
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,300
hallway watching you act creepy and 
judging you for it.

152
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,530
This state of awareness of being watched
by others is called the look.

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,513
When you become aware of the look,
you are forced at least momentarily to 

154
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,104
embody the viewpoint of what [inaudible]
calls the other or an outside entity 

155
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,000
with its own separate consciousness and 
embodying the other's viewpoint.

156
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,250
You feel a major discomfort.

157
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,193
I he shame,
which costs you to pretend that you 

158
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,114
weren't spying.
You were just smelling the door knob 

159
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,850
extended over a lifetime.
Your awareness of the look causes you to

160
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:21,210
live in authentically or what Sartre 
calls bad faith.

161
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,133
Bad faith is basically a failure to 
properly use your freedom or take 

162
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,640
responsibility for your actions.
And Kramer's prisoners certainly seem to

163
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,940
be living in the baddest sort of faith.
Take Carly,

164
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,140
despite her clear choice to let a woman 
die by not giving her an inhaler,

165
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,130
she sees it as an accident.
However,

166
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,640
searcher would tell carly that even in 
choosing not to do anything,

167
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,593
she's still exercised her free will and 
made a choice to watch this lady 

168
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,300
asphyxiate.
Similarly,

169
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,051
Mitch,
Anna,

170
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,884
and Ryan all lie revising history to 
make their crimes seemed like accidents 

171
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,354
or honest mistakes.
Kramer essentially accuses his captives 

172
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,110
of first being criminals and second of 
living in bad faith

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,153
in the past who have all put your room 
and to see if the world about your 

174
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,320
callousness,
your criminality

175
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,243
here.
Notice Kramer's focus not just on each 

176
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,840
individual's crimes,
but on their subsequent lies.

177
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,640
Self deception and cover up.

178
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,400
No,
you wouldn't look in the mirror face who

179
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:38,350
you really are.
The choices you have to feed the hyphen.

180
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,160
You cannot escape the truth.

181
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,413
Sartre,
similarly used the mirror as a metaphor 

182
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,350
for the look of the other.
Of course,

183
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:49,050
Kramer's captives won't look in an 
actual mirror.

184
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,973
He means that their crimes will be 
reflected back to them by the judgment 

185
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,304
of their fellow prisoners.
That judgment can be torture all by 

186
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,694
itself,
like a reverse bear trap for your soul 

187
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,843
and no exit.
After the characters confess their 

188
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,154
crimes,
they suffer anxiety about the judgment 

189
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:08,900
of their peers.
You didn't.

190
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,610
The funeral fret about their reputations
on earth slumped in the chair.

191
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,444
Is that thinking Gaza as a code?
Let's got to think of something that 

192
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:22,620
Jeff Guss on a and beg for reassurance 
that they are not bad people.

193
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Just someone just one test would say 
positively that I did not run away,

194
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,300
that I'm not the sort of man.
He runs away,

195
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,300
that I'm good and brave and decent and 
all the rest of it.

196
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,000
This leads Joseph to utter the famous 
line.

197
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,810
How is other people not just because 
someone always leave their cell phone on

198
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:39,644
in the movie theater,
but because the existence of other 

199
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:45,590
people means the existence of their 
judgment and the shame that ensues.

200
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,110
That's particularly true.
If like Joseph,

201
00:11:48,111 --> 00:11:50,840
you're hanging out with people who know 
your worst secrets.

202
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,650
If Hell is other people knowing your 
worst deeds,

203
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,520
it makes sense that confession is 
Kramer's new favorite torture device.

204
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,503
He's trying to force his captives who 
face Joseph's anguish by making them 

205
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,970
publicly take responsibility for their 
choices.

206
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,013
For instance,
he makes Ryan relive his own worst deed 

207
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,953
as a drunk teenager.
His joy ride inadvertently caused a 

208
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,164
deadly car crash.
He escaped responsibility for it and 

209
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,010
tell all these years later,

210
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,010
I want to live

211
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,843
now.
Searchers version of hell in no exit is 

212
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,080
not the only one that the saw series 
references.

213
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,973
John Kramer also must have studied up on
Dante's inferno and it's the 14th 

214
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:33,900
century is how he and poet to picks his 
own presumably fictional journey through

215
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:34,734
the nine concentric circles of health,
each housing eight different brand of 

216
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:38,484
sinners suffering for eternity.
Dante is hell is governed chiefly by a 

217
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:45,420
rule called Contra Paso Latin for to 
suffer the opposite.

218
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,403
Under Contra Paso sinners suffer 
punishments that are either related to 

219
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,920
or the extreme contrast of the crimes 
they committed on earth.

220
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,053
For instance,
astrologers and false prophets are 

221
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:58,620
forced to walk forever with their heads 
turned backwards.

222
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,633
A punishment for trying to look into the
future or when the powerball chronic 

223
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,730
suck ups are buried in excrement 
because,

224
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,683
well,
you know,

225
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,853
importantly,
the rule of Contra Pato means that a 

226
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:14,361
person's eternity in hell is predestined
by their own freely chosen sins.

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,180
Throughout the saw series,
cramer's show some flair for Contra Paso

228
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:19,014
punishment.
Think of the time he forced a heroin 

229
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:23,190
junkie to dig through a pit of needles 
in search of a key.

230
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,203
Get it like her addiction is the trap or
the cruel money lenders who had to pay 

231
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:28,854
for their lives in pounds of flesh or 
the voyeuristic sex offender who had to 

232
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:34,710
gouge his eyes out or lose all his 
limbs.

233
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,830
Kramer's traps and Jigsaw also share 
some of the same,

234
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,350
uh,
poetry as Dornase and Ferno.

235
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,333
For instance,
we learned that Mitch sold a motorcycle 

236
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:46,830
with a faulty brake to Kramer's nephew 
who later died in an accident.

237
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,813
So what was Mitch is trap secure this 
brake lever or be sliced up by a 

238
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:52,284
circular metal blade and a jams of the 
machine and we think Mitch is saved but 

239
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,233
fittingly,
her homemade brake lever is faulty and 

240
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,714
Mitch plummets into a death spiral.
Later Kramer presents the last two 

241
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,820
survivors,
Anna and Ryan,

242
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,140
what their final game in the form of a 
single shotgun and a vague riddle.

243
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,400
If you want to achieve

244
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,283
your freedom,
you have to realize we've been doing it 

245
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:18,520
backwards

246
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,720
and I immediately lunges for the gun.
Assuming that to win the game she has to

247
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:27,721
shoot Ryan,
but then a broken key falls out.

248
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,740
Cramer had stored the key to their 
freedom inside the weapon.

249
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,230
Here,
Anna shows that she hasn't changed.

250
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,220
She remains willing to ruin or take 
another life to save her own.

251
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,233
According to Kramer's reasoning,
Anna is ultimately trapped and killed 

252
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,470
not by his game,
but by her fundamental moral failings or

253
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,304
jigsaw stops.
Making sense though is when her choice 

254
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,333
also Ryan to be trapped in the barn 
after he at least somewhat assumes 

255
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,054
responsibility for his deadly joy ride.
And from there on Jigsaw seems to 

256
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,074
abandon any semblance of a moral lesson 
moving from the doomed barn adventures 

257
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,360
to the less interesting laser color trap
holding detective Halloran and Logan,

258
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:11,150
the forensics guy.
They each make their own confessions.

259
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,340
I'm so sorry.

260
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,390
And then logan fakes his death,
comes back to life and reveals that he's

261
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,224
the new jigsaw.
Then he leaves Halloran first debt 

262
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,530
savage Logan May be John Kramer's one 
man tribute band,

263
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,440
but will he further the moral philosophy
of the series?

264
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,493
Looks like we'll find out soon enough.
There's already talk of a ninth saw 

265
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:35,060
movie with Logan's final declaration I 
speak to.

266
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,540
It sounds like we're in for some 
forensic pathologists gone wild,

267
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,670
but what do you think was jigsaw and 
insightful philosophical inquiry or just

268
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:45,504
an excuse to watch a guy gets shredded 
into confetti and is loken a generic 

269
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:53,100
creep with all the charisma of a latex 
glove or the fresh new villain.

270
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:53,934
The sauce series needed.
Let us know in the comments and as 

271

thanks for watching peace.
