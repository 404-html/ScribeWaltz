1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,520
What's up everybody?
Jared again?

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,640
Today we're talking about animation,
most powerful pipsqueak.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,140
Sorry about that,
Edward.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,093
Now full metal alchemist.
Brotherhood has all the trappings of an 

5
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,100
instant classic high concept science 
fiction Shit.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,360
Awesome.
Fight scenes,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,140
definitely strong philosophical core.
Well,

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,190
that's why we're here.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,053
Wow.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,850
Throughout Edward and Alphonse's journey
to restore their bodies.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,773
The two are confronted with various 
discourses on the efficacy and 

12
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:38,600
application of science or in their case 
alchemy.

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,823
Sure,
it's through alchemy that they hope to 

14
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:41,684
recover their bodies,
but they also see it used for some 

15
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,020
pretty awful things.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,540
So what is brotherhood saying about 
science and the way it's applied to this

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,270
world and how does faith fit into this 
discussion?

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,500
Well,
let's find out.

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,310
Welcome to this wisecrack addition on 
the philosophy of full metal alchemist,

20
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,040
brotherhood,
and of course spoilers ahead,

21
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,970
but first a quick primer full metal 
alchemist.

22
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:08,804
Brotherhood is set in a mistress,
a country reminiscent of pre world war 

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,593
two Europe who's defining feature is the
success of Alchemy or the manipulation 

24
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:19,010
and altering of matter using natural 
energy.

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,203
Alchemy is essentially treated as a 
science one that combines chemistry and 

26
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:26,390
biology with its own unique laws and 
principles,

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,140
alchemies most important law,
the law of equivalent exchange,

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,750
non Nico,
you,

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,190
hello,
no

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,313
or you know the law.
That means if you get the right 

31
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,430
materials and draw a circle,
you can do this.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,990
The show establishes a push and pull 
dynamic between science and faith almost

33
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:49,991
immediately in episode three hour travel
to the desert town of or to investigate.

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,053
Father coordinate below a holy figure 
who has gained control of the people by 

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,400
offering them with miracles and 
indoctrinating them in the faith of Lido

36
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,900
wisdom.
The second they arrived,

37
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,470
though the brothers make their views 
abundantly clear to the faithful

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,040
in general,
are you motivated

39
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,650
and their skepticism toward the divine 
is justified.

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,633
As it turns out,
Cornell's miracles are just cleverly 

41
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,574
bailed.
Applications of alchemy that he uses to 

42
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:24,944
attract followers,
willing to die for him at an Alec 

43
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,940
exposed.
Cornell is a fraud,

44
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,150
and liberate the people at your firm is 
ideological tyranny.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,510
So science rules,
faith drools,

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,321
right?
Well,

47
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,640
not so fast.
In the following episode,

48
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,820
the brothers are sent to study under the
sewing life alchemists show,

49
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:42,654
Tucker Tucker was the first outcome is 
to successfully create a talking cmera 

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,123
and tries to repeat his success in order
to retain his state alchemist 

51
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:50,824
certification.
The rx fascination quickly turns to 

52
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,030
horror and in one of the biggest gut 
punches and anime history,

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,320
we see this.

54
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,683
Woo.

55
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,720
Yeah,
that's right.

56
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,583
Tucker actually used his family,
dog and his own daughter as components 

57
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:13,910
to create his Camaro,
but far from feeling remorse.

58
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,180
Tucker claims he was only doing what 
science demands

59
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,820
nondual Zinger,
you know,

60
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,610
simple moose,
little Jentezen Kendall,

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,660
Tau Mama Jemima.
Send that out

62
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,450
in the face of such an atrocity.
Science no longer seemed so innocent,

63
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,284
does it?
So where does this conflict between 

64
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,770
science and faith lead us?
Tucker,

65
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:41,180
the amoral alchemist in search of 
scientific knowledge at any cost largely

66
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:45,110
sets the tone for the rest of the show.
Over at 64 episodes,

67
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,003
Brotherhood forces us to question the 
value of single mindedly clinging to 

68
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:49,964
science and the consequences of reducing
all knowledge to scientific terms of 

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
motive thought loosely known in the real
world.

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,700
As scientism,
now I know what you're thinking,

71
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,623
jared,
doubting science is what people in a 

72
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,014
coat do,
but just humoring when philosophers 

73
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:05,264
critique scientism,
they're not saying that science is a 

74
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,294
lie.
What they're criticizing is how we put 

75
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:14,180
scientific knowledge above all other 
knowledge and how we try to reduce other

76
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:17,690
forms of knowledge into it.
According to philosopher Paul Fire,

77
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,524
Robin,
science is just one of many competing 

78
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,314
explanatory frameworks,
one which is neither as rational nor 

79
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,360
consistent as it pretends to be fire.

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,650
Robin's favorite example is copernicus,
who's heliocentric model of the universe

81
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:34,370
was actually rejected by scientists of 
his day to them,

82
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,204
aristotle's idea of celestial spheres 
offered a fuller explanation of why the 

83
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:42,560
planets moved into the sky.
While Copernicus's model could correctly

84
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:45,980
calculate the movement of the planets.
It couldn't explain why they moved,

85
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:46,814
as they did until Newton's theory on 
gravity was published over a century 

86
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,623
later.
Science in this case wasn't interested 

87
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:57,110
in the truth so much as self 
preservation like any ideology fire.

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,930
Robin worries that an unquestioning 
acceptance of it,

89
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,883
like with Leonora and Lito Ism can lead 
to some potentially disastrous results 

90
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,170
in his book against method in science 
and a free society fire robin desks.

91
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,123
Is it not possible that science as we 
know it today or a search for the truth 

92
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,114
and the style of traditional philosophy,
will create a monster and monsters are 

93
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:21,020
exactly what science creates in the 
world of brotherhood,

94
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,220
such as manmade Camaro's that are 
referred to as ungodly experiment

95
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,520
can put it into then when there is a 
killer.

96
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,563
This impersonal dehumanizing aspect of 
alchemy is enshrined in the law of 

97
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:39,920
equivalent exchange,
which inherently reduces objects,

98
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,813
animals,
and even people to their physical 

99
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:45,590
components.
The oreck brothers entire journey starts

100
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,424
because the to believe they can bring 
their mother back to life by simply 

101
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:51,770
transmuting the basic ingredients of a 
human being.

102
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,640
This dehumanizing nature is furthered by
one of alchemies,

103
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,910
most sought after the philosopher's 
stone.

104
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,043
When Ed and ell decode Dr Marquez notes,
they realize the key ingredient to the 

105
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,690
stone is human life

106
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,863
kingdom.

107
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,170
The stone is the ultimate product of 
alchemy allowing its users to ignore the

108
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,950
law of equivalent exchange,
but even though the stone can restore at

109
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,350
now's bodies,
the two are reluctant,

110
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,260
if not just plain unwilling to use the 
stone.

111
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,850
In contrast,
the homonculus artificial humans powered

112
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,400
by philosopher stones regurgitate 
scientific philosophy,

113
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,980
reducing the souls trapped within the 
stones,

114
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,013
Tamir alchemic principles while Ed and 
Al both use the power of the stones on 

115
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:08,960
one occasion each they do so while 
respecting the autonomy of those souls,

116
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,130
mother,
to stay me,

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,160
to cuddle.
You don't want me to come.

118
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,783
Committee,

119
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,120
this distinguishes the brothers as moral
according to philosopher Emmanuel Kant,

120
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,073
who famously stated that you must treat 
humanity whether in your own person or 

121
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:36,100
in the person of any other,
always at the same time as an end,

122
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,113
never merely as a means for people are 
never meant to be used or reduced to 

123
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:42,754
calculations,
but rather are always a goal in 

124
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:45,484
themselves.
But an analysis problem with alchemy is 

125
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:48,664
larger than it's impersonal nature,
but also it's subservience to the 

126
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:53,074
military.
Alchemy is so under the control of the 

127
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:56,164
industry and government that there are 
actually three state appointed tenants 

128
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,930
of Alchemy,
the first of which is the literally obey

129
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,390
the military who go drinking,
who knows,

130
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,920
somebody seeing him.
She didn't call me Jessica goodness.

131
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,783
In fact,
state alchemists are generally referred 

132
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,750
to as dogs at the military and even as 
human weapons.

133
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,090
Hey,
good.

134
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,950
In his book,
science wars sociologists,

135
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:23,784
Stanley Aronowitz,
argues that scientists often view 

136
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:26,634
themselves as vehicles facilitating the 
advancement of learning and by 

137
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:30,954
application the progress of mankind.
Yet scientists funding must come from 

138
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,210
somewhere and often it's from 
corporations or the state.

139
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,463
As such,
scientists don't really own their 

140
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:42,744
discoveries and have little say about 
their application throughout the 

141
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:46,644
animate.
Ed Constantly clashes with this 

142
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:52,380
militarization of science by the state 
and his own complicity with it.

143
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,730
As Alex Armstrong succinctly puts it,
couple

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,833
thinking just a shoe tie shoe and 
they'll have a new Audi Shindand 

145
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,400
accuser,
but the hospital loading it.

146
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,893
Recall it.

147
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,510
We even see this military influence 
distort the basic principles of science.

148
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,170
When ed and ell reminisce about being 
trained on a desert island as children,

149
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,093
they come to the epiphany that alchemy 
is all about understanding the natural 

150
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,324
flow of energy,
both deconstructing and reconstructing 

151
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:22,954
it,

152
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,480
so now that Lcd Bouzouki stair cycle,

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,550
what this principle is leader,
twisted in the mouths of the military in

154
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:42,780
justifying destroying the whole country 
and slaughtering its population.

155
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,800
One general even goes so far as to 
rephrase it as alchemic rebirth.

156
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,753
Nice.
I see them almost that you didn't get a 

157
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,120
coach,
you punk in night.

158
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,240
What do I do?
I didn't.

159
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,670
Social Security goes through to this 
thing.

160
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,593
Lacey,

161
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,363
as tools of the government alchemists 
have become the very instruments of the 

162
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:13,810
series chief antagonist father who 
controls the MSG in state,

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,740
father desires nothing more than to 
assume the mantle of God,

164
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,840
a goal which he's used,
alchemy,

165
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,793
countless military conflicts and 
millions of innocent lives to prepare 

166
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,090
for.
In fact,

167
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,090
a masters is most brutal and heartless 
war.

168
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,313
The war of extermination was fought just
a further father's plan and it's this 

169
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:37,390
war where the state alchemists made 
their largest military impact.

170
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,160
Good job or we've got an issue bothers 
him.

171
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:41,994
It's all clinical.
What's shocking about each ball isn't 

172
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,770
just the devastating force that alchemy 
wrecked on it.

173
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,370
The scientific language used to explain 
it.

174
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,800
Even the good guys here can't help but 
couch.

175
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:57,634
What's essentially genocide in these 
sterile scientific terms almost on the 

176
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,220
cable issue.
Bird.

177
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,940
We can do that.
In fact,

178
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,630
this sanitizing nature of scientific 
language is what escalated,

179
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,100
fallen wharton,
new heights as fear.

180
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,963
King Bradley told the high priest of the
shallow when he offered himself up in 

181
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,384
exchange for a ceasefire.
The law of equivalent exchange won't 

182
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:20,500
allow it

183
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,500
so much coaching or one on one or so 
days,

184
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,620
the fewer even considered his wife to be
nothing more than an expendable pond for

185
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:38,110
his greater scheme.
Now,

186
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,970
if the title of purer is raising 
eyebrows among you,

187
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,923
there's a good reason for that.
The country have a masters is 

188
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:45,860
reminiscent of pre World War II,
Germany,

189
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,843
uh,
Milton nation expanding beyond its 

190
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:51,950
borders and a blonde haired blue eyed 
army whose uniforms look a lot like that

191
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:52,784
of the SSS.
Even the might is right motivation 

192
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,510
behind Nazi Germany,
bubbles to the surface and a mistress as

193
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:02,950
general raven invoke social darwinism to
justify mass extermination.

194
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,340
So John,
when you could go so good though,

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,200
you know what you should see how you use
of.

196
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,483
That's not enough to convince you.
Then you only have to compare a 

197
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,563
mistresses.
Human experiments did that of Auschwitz 

198
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:17,334
as lead Dr Josef Mengele,
whether it's raising babies and 

199
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:21,294
underground laboratories,
stitching together people in animals or 

200
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,403
ripping soltes from bodies.
It's hard to say that a mistress lacks 

201
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:33,040
the same wanton cruelty and morbid 
scientific curiosity that defined mangle

202
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:33,874
his operations.
Mengele established a kindergarten at 

203
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:37,134
Auschwitz for his younger experiments 
allegedly stitching to gypsy girls 

204
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:42,720
together,
and if he could have gotten his hands on

205
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,760
a literal soul,
he probably would have mutilated.

206
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,093
Oh yeah.
Did we mention that fire robin to 

207
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,880
actually fought as a lieutenant in World
War II,

208
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,300
even earning an iron cross in the 
process,

209
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,900
witnessing firsthand the scientific 
arguments made by a dictatorship for war

210
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,734
and genocide.
It's no surprise that fire robin would 

211
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:01,884
one day proposed a separation between 
science and states with ultimate power 

212
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:10,200
resting in democracy in his lecture,
how to defend society from science.

213
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,093
He argued there must be a formal 
separation between state and science 

214
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,120
just as there is now a formal separation
between state and church.

215
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,970
Scientists may be consulted on important
projects,

216
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:21,804
but the final judgment must be left to 
the democratically elected consulting 

217
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:25,914
bodies,
so it's safe to say that full metal 

218
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:32,190
alchemist presents a cautionary tale 
about the blind adherence to science,

219
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,590
but what does it say about faith?
Well,

220
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,424
throughout its 64 episode run,
faith is often portrayed as another 

221
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,580
explanatory model,
another source of truth and power.

222
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,653
In fact,
for a show populated almost entirely by 

223
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:45,504
scientists,
the characters make a number of appeals 

224
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,260
to faith.
In the episode,

225
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,580
the miracle of Brush Valley and an owl 
witness,

226
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,414
the delivery of a baby become awestruck 
and point out the limitations of 

227
00:13:55,741 --> 00:14:00,741
alchemy.
Dr Marco,

228
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,464
the alchemist,
largely responsible for the creation of 

229
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,670
the philosopher's stone during the civil
war,

230
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,533
calls it fate that he met the ish fallen
scar before the to set out together to 

231
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,090
challenge the government.
Similarly,

232
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:17,924
Knox who worked as a doctor during the 
war and was subsequently estranged from 

233
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:24,290
his family invokes God when they've 
returned to him.

234
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,520
Some of similar you can let me know.

235
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,380
Even Bradley,
a Homunculus wonders if his own death at

236
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:37,290
the hand of scar was providence coming 
with Shinji.

237
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,173
No.
Good.

238
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,040
Cool.
You Know Kim?

239
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,660
Oh,
what in you are it

240
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,333
Bradley?
Who mercilessly killed these people 

241
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,094
during the war was told that God would 
strike him down one day and it was the 

242
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:51,974
son looking like a crescent moon,
which together symbolize God in Alchemy 

243
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,980
that blinded him and allowed scar too.

244
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,380
Right?
The finishing blow

245
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,460
is that the thematic takeaway of the 
show?

246
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,260
Science is bad.
Faith is good.

247
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,420
So keep on praying.
Well,

248
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:08,254
not quite.
See the problem with scientism isn't 

249
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,700
that science is bad and that non science
is good.

250
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,743
Fire.
Robin isn't giving the middle finger to 

251
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:17,470
vaccines and posting about chem trails 
on twitter.

252
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,560
Nope,
instead,

253
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,443
his main contention is that science is 
just one of many ideas that propel 

254
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:23,994
society and should be treated,
thus what fire alb into poses is any 

255
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,413
unreflective,
veneration of any ideology because it 

256
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,804
inhibits free thought as it turns out,
the blind following of science as the 

257
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:36,094
arbiter of truth is just as harmful as 
the blind following of faith as the 

258
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:40,774
arbiter of truth,
whether it's father cornell and the 

259
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,533
homonculus using the Lido is to incite 
violence against their enemies or scar 

260
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:51,070
using his god is Vala to justify his 
vengeance against the alchemist

261
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,310
meaningfully Camino Sindhis.

262
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,983
Faith alone can be every bit justice,
scary as science characters grow and 

263
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,564
brotherhood.
When they realized the limitations of 

264
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,370
adhering to any one ideology,
Edward and Alphonse,

265
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:08,204
for example,
begin to question the foundations of 

266
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,544
western Alchemy,
which supposedly takes us energy from 

267
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,240
the tectonic movements of the earth's 
mantle.

268
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,770
When father manages to cancel it out,
it's their quest for an explanation that

269
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:21,770
leads them to science as eastern 
equivalent alcohol history,

270
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,150
which uses life energy from the planet.
It's ultimately bridging the gap between

271
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,300
these two ideologies that allows our 
heroes to eventually trial.

272
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,140
The two different scientists come 
together to make a reverse transmutation

273
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,050
circle that saves the lives of all 
semesters.

274
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,010
Perhaps no character embodies this 
development more than scar,

275
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,290
a survivor of the Ashmolean,
war of extinction,

276
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,183
scar target state alchemists out of 
revenge to him not only are alchemists 

277
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,194
weapons,
but they transgress against God who 

278
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:51,194
alone possesses the right to create,
but as scar learns more about a 

279
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:55,184
mistress,
he realizes how wrong he was to seek 

280
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:57,830
vengeance.

281
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,830
No new tool you will can you committed 
to you in show who who Costanoa Tj

282
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,083
scar who wants cloaked his actions and 
the words of God finally understands 

283
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:09,314
that no ideology can justify murder.
Scar even breaks from the strict laws 

284
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:14,174
that govern his fate,
making use of the very alchemy that his 

285
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:20,110
god a board in order to save the country
he wants hated

286
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,510
soldier code orange issue

287
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,933
bars.
Transformation stands in stark contrast 

288
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,310
to the show's main antagonist.
Father,

289
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,580
who clings to his single minded belief 
in science.

290
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,533
Father becomes obsessed with the power 
of alchemy and takes this obsession to 

291
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:41,524
the logical extreme.
Viewing mankind is little more than 

292
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:49,171
materials for him to use in becoming God
was on blinded by scientism.

293
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,073
Father can't understand the value of 
human emotions and discards them in his 

294
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,244
attempt to become perfect.
He literally ripped the seven deadly 

295
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,900
sins from himself.
Lust,

296
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,340
greed,
slaw,

297
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,990
gluttony,
envy,

298
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,680
wrath and pride.
Who in turn become the other homonculus.

299
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,813
Ultimately,
it's this conviction and the absolute 

300
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,424
supremacy of science and the ability to 
achieve perfection through it that 

301
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,624
undoes father,
the souls trapped in the philosopher's 

302
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,550
stone which he dismissed as we're 
energy,

303
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,700
begin to assert their wills and rebel 
against him.

304
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,743
Father,
conception of a soul as a mere 

305
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,723
ingredient fails to account for the 
autonomy of these individuals after an 

306
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,193
epic punch to the gut,
father is finally killed and dragged 

307
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:34,524
back into the void from whence he came 
where he meets the real god of being 

308
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,430
called truth.
Still desperately clinging to scientism.

309
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,710
Father demands to know what he did 
wrong,

310
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,233
unlike scar and others.
Father refused to recognize any kind of 

311
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,710
human wisdom beyond alchemy.

312
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,720
I didn't really three already.

313
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,183
All of this goes to show what makes ed 
and now particularly special throughout 

314
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:12,054
the series.
They're humble rejection of a single 

315
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,724
ideology from the shows outset,
the to grapple with what alchemy is and 

316
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,860
what it means to be a state alchemist.

317
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,413
The

318
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,480
this questioning that makes the 
brother's seen both naive and likable at

319
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:32,260
the brothers core is a strong desire to 
discover their own truth.

320
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,760
When psychopath extraordinary solve,
Jay Kim Lee has alphonse cornered.

321
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,570
He wonders why our hero doesn't just 
take the philosopher's stone and get his

322
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:42,080
body back.
None of this will not.

323
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:42,963
Chicago,
Jibo,

324
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,870
Colorado Toady model stomach go online,
disco.

325
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,103
Sure,
the country would face certain 

326
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:48,904
destruction from father,
but that's just equivalent exchange 

327
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:53,530
inaction.
In order to get their bodies back,

328
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,920
they'd have to give up the world safety 
tool.

329
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:56,754
Go quote on the Horse,
but our rejects that alchemic worldview 

330
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,800
reaffirming their desire to find their 
own truth.

331
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,810
Yes,
simple.

332
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,850
It's this search for possibilities that 
distinguishes the brothers and allows ed

333
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:13,684
to make his final transmutation.
After al sacrifices himself in order to 

334
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,004
give ed his arm back,
ed follows his brother into the portal 

335
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,260
to bring him back.
When asked by the truth what price he'll

336
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:24,094
pay.
Edd smiles and offers this ability to 

337
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:29,640
perform alchemy and recognizes the 
arrogance and thinking that outcome.

338
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:32,740
He could explain everything,
let alone solve all his problems.

339
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,750
She didn't need to go to the citadel.
Coke.

340
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,250
It's the dog or the dog.

341
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,353
Unlike father who couldn't accept his 
place in the universe and equated 

342
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,550
alchemy with power.
Ed knows the truth.

343
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,380
No,
not anymore.

344
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:59,810
Keeps you the their bodies back in the 
day.

345
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:06,460
Save what's left for our heroes to do in
typical elric fashion.

346
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,000
It's the keep searching for truth and 
new methods to discover it.

347
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,120
As Alphonse puts it,
they want to give back to the people who

348
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,460
helped them all along their journey,
but it's not a simple given.

349
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,260
Take not a cold formula like the law of 
equivalent exchange.

350
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,280
Yeah.
June,

351
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,060
July.
She's like it.

352
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,360
A book that see

353
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,693
did that end.
Alice traveling east and Ed West in 

354
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,910
hopes of gathering all the knowledge to 
make this principle a reality.

355
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,253
Of course,
old habits tend to die hard and when ed 

356
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,770
finally confesses his feelings too,
when it comes out like this.

357
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,110
Humble.
Yeah,

358
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,233
of course.
Maybe ed didn't need to go so far from 

359
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:01,730
home to realize that science alone can't
explain everything.

360
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,980
We waited 64 episodes for that moment 
and it was damn worth it.

361
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,450
So what do you think wise,
crack?

362
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,553
Well,
pure devotion to science lead us down a 

363
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,550
dark path.
Do we need to inject a little?

364
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,550
I Dunno,
maybe philosophy into how we look at the

365
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:22,384
world.
Let us know what you think in the

Wise crack.
Although father may have been condemned 

370
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:30,934
