1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,350
Hey,
wise,

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,460
crack.
Jared here.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,413
Full disclosure,
this video was made possible by the 

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:13,130
people over at for.
We've been fans of the Mondo show,

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:13,964
happy tree friends for a while,
so when verve reached out to us and 

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,620
asked us to check out the new Mondo 
show,

7
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,200
Gary and his demons streaming 
exclusively on verb.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,930
We were pretty excited and five episodes
in.

9
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:24,764
We couldn't help but notice a lot of 
similarities to to otherwise crack 

10
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:28,334
favorites archer and this show that 
we've mentioned maybe once or twice 

11
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:32,624
before.
Don't hate one particular moment stood 

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:37,040
out to us as particularly zeitgeisty.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,940
When it comes to murdering people,
I guess you could say.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,120
Why don't you say,
I guess you could say here.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,410
That's what you're going to say.
That's not what I was going to say.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,470
Pretty sure it is.
Oh,

17
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:51,810
it's not your whole personality.
His hooks,

18
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,240
man.
There's other things you can say.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,760
All right.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,000
Which reminded us of this.
God,

21
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:58,960
would you give it a rest?

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,550
Damn,
I had something to this and this.

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,950
I guess I did the Butler.
Does it?

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,043
Does that scan?

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,430
This subversion of hero one liners got 
us thinking,

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,820
why is this kind of humor so prevalent 
these days?

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,773
Is there something more going on here 
that says something about our modern 

28
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,940
social condition,
and as we watched more,

29
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,730
we realized that was just the tip of the
iceberg,

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,070
so if you haven't seen Gary and his 
demons yet,

31
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:29,904
check out [inaudible] dot co slash wise,
crack birth 30 day free trial and join 

32
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,254
us as we impart on a time honored,
wise crack tradition over explaining a 

33
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,424
joke for the sake of social commentary.
One thing we've noticed lately is a 

34
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:42,474
particular trend in comedy,
subjecting the fantastic to the mundane 

35
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,183
in rick and morty.
Be Fanciful Tale of Jack and the 

36
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:49,914
beanstalk is taken down a peg.
When the narrative becomes mired in 

37
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,780
legal proceedings,
be horrifying.

38
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,614
Freddy Kruger has the same marital woes 
and performance anxiety as your average 

39
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,870
club and even the post apocalypse still 
has suburban domestic spats.

40
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,360
Dang,
Dang.

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Dang.
Wow.

42
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:06,740
Everybody hear that

43
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,880
in archer,
these secret agent fantasy of blowing up

44
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:13,480
and womanizing is subjected to the 
realities of expense reports.

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,600
Some serious discrepancies in your 
account,

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,100
I'm sure you wouldn't use operational 
funds for personal expenses.

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,663
HR,
most of my jobs dealing with sexual 

48
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,320
harassment complaints against Mr Archer 
and hearing loss.

49
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,180
What Barry,
what?

50
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,410
We don't have any pepper.
Earplugs.

51
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,263
You idiot.
You know how bad that is for your 

52
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,184
eardrums.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,233
Gary and his demons does the same.
Subjecting demon hunting to the mundane 

54
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,060
activities of office life and sock 
puppets.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,370
You'd be comfortable talking to my 
friend.

56
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,600
Suck Guy Suck.

57
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,660
Why does this comedy works so well and 
why now?

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,470
Or at least for adult cartoon viewers 
between the ages of 18 and 34.

59
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,453
Well to overly dramatic one could say 
it's because our dreams are dead still 

60
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,160
with me.
Good.

61
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,173
Because to understand why we're going to
have to dive into the philosophy of 

62
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:11,684
humor.
There are a few major theories of humor 

63
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:14,414
out there,
but one that popped up only a few 

64
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,563
hundred years ago is incongruent.
Basically the idea that humor arises 

65
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:23,900
from the discrepancy between our 
expectations and reality.

66
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,390
I mean,
what is a punchline,

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,350
if not the subversion of our 
expectation?

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,150
Remember we used to smoke pot and then 
talk about how one day maybe we could be

69
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,440
on Conan together.
Yeah,

70
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,710
that was yesterday,
but

71
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,020
there's one philosopher who takes this 
further,

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,033
arguing that humor arises from the 
[inaudible] between our notion of 

73
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:41,574
ourselves as humans and the subversion 
of that notion by the mechanical nature 

74
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,510
of our lives.
While this theory is a bit antiquated,

75
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,380
we can use it to help us understand 
humor.

76
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,263
Today in 1900 philosopher Henri Bergson 
theorized that the source of humor was 

77
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:56,394
the mechanical encrusted upon the human 
writing during the industrial 

78
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:00,930
revolution.
Bergson said,

79
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:01,764
when we laugh because someone falls,
it's not necessarily their misfortune 

80
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,454
that we find funny,
but the spectacle of a machine 

81
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,090
malfunctioning.
In this case,

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,950
our bodies,
for example,

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,873
take the classic prank of pulling a 
chair out from under a friend about to 

84
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,830
sit.
They fall on their ass.

85
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,470
Hilarity ensues.
According to Bergson,

86
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:20,304
we laughed because an action,
as routine as sitting down is basically 

87
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:24,384
the body on autopilot.
Seeing that habitual emotion fail is 

88
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,823
what generates the lows,
and while this kind of falling on your 

89
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,810
ass humor certainly predates machines.

90
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,763
We can still think of it in terms of 
mechanical rigidity against human 

91
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:38,784
flexibility.
It's probably no coincidence that 

92
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:44,700
Bergson was writing when factories and 
machines reshaped modern life.

93
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,713
More than 30 years later,
Charlie Chaplin would in some ways 

94
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,313
embody elements of Bergson's theory in 
modern times where the intrusion of 

95
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:56,010
mechanization onto the human is put 
front and center.

96
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,053
If modern times was so popular,
was it because he struck a nerve with 

97
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,580
people's relationship to machines for 
chaplain?

98
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,520
It's not just that humans are acting 
like machines,

99
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,383
but have also become entangled in a 
society of machines which brings us to 

100
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:10,854
modern day.
We no longer feel our sense of self 

101
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:13,524
threatened by physical machines,
but another kind of machine you see 

102
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,510
Bergson's formulation has evolved.
Humor isn't just the machine and crusted

103
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,900
upon the human society and crusted upon 
the human,

104
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,560
the component parts of society,
state and corporate bureaucracy,

105
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,950
cultural expectations all act like a 
kind of machine.

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,960
One that happens to simultaneously feed 
us dreams and tear them away from us.

107
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,460
The discrepancy between our fantasies 
that helped us cope with reality and the

108
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:45,210
reality that forsakes those dreams is 
the new engine of humor.

109
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,044
In 2018,
Gary and his demons imagines a chosen 

110
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:53,940
demon hunter as a sad sack working stiff
who can't even retire.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,530
I realized why,
I mean all the time it's of my job sucks

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,340
and my life

113
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,100
sucks more than anyone else's and that's

114
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,310
navel gazing.
That is the truth.

115
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,180
Demons have to face being in or out like
fashion trends

116
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,483
that hot new mirror monster running his 
mouth about how the old guard is out of 

117
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,063
touch.
Bloody Mary dates back to the 15 

118
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,893
hundreds,

119
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,160
mira monster,
and in archer.

120
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,083
Even the exciting world of espionage 
won't take your mind off your flex 

121
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:23,750
account.

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,590
I got to spend the balance of my God 
damn flex account

123
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,410
and while Rick may be the only one above
it all,

124
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,410
I mean he's not bogged down by expense 
reports and bureaucracy net bureaucrats.

125
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,443
I don't respect them.
Just keep shooting morning his arch 

126
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,234
nemesis or a bunch of himself that 
reduce other versions of himself to 

127
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,774
factory workers and students.
The whole joke of simple rick is 

128
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:45,884
revealing the real nature of escapist 
fantasy as just another cog in the 

129
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:54,080
soulless machine come home to the unique
flavor of shattering the grand illusion.

130
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,730
Come home to simple rick,
and it's not just these three shows.

131
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,683
This kind of humor is everywhere.
The good place imagines an afterlife 

132
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,690
full of legal,
arbitration and Algorithms.

133
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,613
When your time on earth has ended,
we calculate the total value of your 

134
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,204
life.
He was saying are perfectly accurate 

135
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:17,000
measuring system only.
The people with the very highest scores,

136
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,600
the true cream of the crop got to come 
here to the good price.

137
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,523
One Punch man imagined super heroing as 
a dumb bureaucratic game mired in red 

138
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:30,110
tape and the sleeper hit soon to be TV.
Show what we do in the shadows envisions

139
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,710
frightening vampires fighting over banal
roommate issues.

140
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,620
Vampires don't do dishes to return to 
Berkson.

141
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,483
If we find all this funny,
it's because we're confronted with a 

142
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,544
mirror of our own lives.
More than just laughing at bodies as 

143
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:43,994
machines,
we laugh when we imagine people as mere 

144
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,813
instruments have a greater machine.
Bergson gives the example of a person 

145
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,550
who performs their duty,
not like a human,

146
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,473
but like a machine.
He cites a story he found in a 

147
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:56,054
newspaper.
A large steamer was wrecked off the 

148
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,910
coast of France after courageously 
rushing to save the passengers.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,270
The customs officers didn't ask if the 
survivors were okay,

150
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,900
but rather immediately asked if they had
anything to declare.

151
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,660
The customs officers were not acting as 
humans,

152
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,300
but mere instruments have a larger 
bureaucracy,

153
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,040
and this is exactly what shows like 
archer Gary and his demons and sometimes

154
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,120
rick and morty rely on how we've become 
near instruments have a larger game.

155
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,890
We know how you feel.
We're working.

156
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,840
Our assembly line is justice.

157
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,843
It puts on display the inclusivity 
between the way we imagine the world 

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,930
ought to be and the way it really is 
because of this discrepancy.

159
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:36,764
We no longer live in a world where we 
can stomach the cheery idealism of 

160
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:40,604
heroes past,
but have to deconstruct the fantasy at 

161
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:46,130
every turn because our fantasies have 
been deconstructed.

162
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,173
We can't imagine much of anything 
without wanting to think of what is 

163
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,610
pulling its strings.
Take these superhero one liner,

164
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,470
one say,
source of Catharsis.

165
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,323
If it got motherfucker,
it now needs to be exposed as a tired 

166
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,050
cliche.
So we get this

167
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,720
table for one.
Want to try?

168
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,930
Want to try one more time?
Um,

169
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,830
this guy's cut off

170
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,353
beause you know this.
You should know that as an original and 

171
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,354
this Gillette,
she'd be ready with the transdermal 

172
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,560
solution of the most powerful laxative 
known to man.

173
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,840
Damn man,
I had something for this.

174
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,853
Marvel movies can't sell superheroes 
without constantly undercutting the 

175
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,120
seriousness of what they're doing.

176
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,020
We know other.
He's a friend from work

177
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,383
pools,
one of the most popular superheroes by 

178
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,664
virtue of not being a hero at all,
and things like cinema since draw humor 

179
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,610
from subjecting films to a level of 
cold,

180
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,040
hard logic that they weren't even built 
for.

181
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,070
This leads us to the second marker of 
modern humor,

182
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
a broken protagonist.
Now this certainly isn't new.

183
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,203
Jerry Seinfeld did it over 20 years ago,
but instead of looking up to burt 

184
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,954
reynolds,
now admire a broken version of burt 

185
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,240
reynolds or a broken van,
helsing or a broken doc brown.

186
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,300
And then there's something like,
it's always sunny in Philadelphia,

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,313
a show that according to create or Glenn
Howerton shows what the American dream 

188
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:08,130
looks like when you fail.
Even the notion of doing good deeds,

189
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,023
his shadow on relishing in the 
collateral damage that often comes with 

190
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:12,984
being a quote.
Good guy are demon hunter amputates an 

191
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,344
orphan by accident and tries to be a 
nicer person before realizing it's 

192
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:20,604
pointless.

193
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,070
You came,
oh,

194
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:25,370
I knew you cared about me.
You are a good guy.

195
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:26,963
Similarly,
morty tries to save an interdimensional 

196
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,394
being from assassination only to 
discover it wants to exterminate all 

197
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,204
life.
Carbon based life is a threat tool I 

198
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,913
allies to us.
You are what you would call a disease 

199
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,933
and has to kill it himself.
Rick highlights the futility of do 

200
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,114
gooding when he says,
what about the reality where Hitler 

201
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:44,970
cured cancer?
Morty,

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,833
the answer is don't think about it.
And the entire premise of archer is to 

203
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,194
explore these self obsessed 
eccentricities of the people who are 

204
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:56,721
supposed to keep us safe at night.
To summarize,

205
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,200
we were promised jet packs and hover 
boards.

206
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,450
And because we never got them,
we have no fantasies,

207
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,313
no heroes,
and some serious skepticism about doing 

208
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:07,704
good.
And now the best sense of pleasure we 

209
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:12,780
can get is collectively reflecting on 
that sense of disappointment.

210
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,763
Now,
that's not to say we're completely 

211
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,294
without dreams.
Instead of dreaming of Nicer cars and 

212
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,310
the perfect relationship,
which shirt definitely still happens.

213
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,030
We also get gratification by relishing 
in the utterly mundane.

214
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Would you rather get embroiled in a 
particularly nasty Ponzi scheme or go on

215
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,320
a date with trevor from school?

216
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,030
Things like the Roy game or this are 
barely even science fiction.

217
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,460
She's obsessed with her new virtual 
bouncer game.

218
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,460
Real fun.
You on the list?

219
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,530
Nice tripe house to the back of the 
line.

220
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,383
Is it any different than the wildly 
popular job simulator game where one 

221
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:52,890
pretends to be a robot,
poorly reenacting mundane office work or

222
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,630
clicker games,
but is everything hopeless?

223
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,613
Of course not.
Yes we wise crackers can sometimes seem 

224
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:00,700
like curmudgeons,
but hey,

225
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,710
that's what happens when you read 
philosophy,

226
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,130
Bro.
But I promise there's still hope like my

227
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,170
dog.
What do you look at?

228
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,850
Dead baby phase muffin man.
Oh,

229
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,743
or for instance,
I went to this place that took my two 

230
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:15,070
favorite sauces,
hummus and garlic sauce,

231
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,880
and turned it into one sauce.
It pretty much shattered my worldview.

232
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,863
So look,
how can you fixate on the hopelessness 

233
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,050
of the modern condition when there are 
still breakthroughs made everyday in sos

234
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,990
technology and for more good old 
fashioned distractions,

235
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,943
check out new episodes of Gary and his 
demons on verb every Sunday by going to
