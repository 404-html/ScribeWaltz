00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,340
The high roll in style that's portrayed 
on television is basically a dream,

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,510
meaning that if you have a dream,
it can happen,

3
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,510
it could come true and in a way it's 
good for kids to see that.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,670
Um,
but a lot of times I feel like art,

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,643
if you tell it the high rollers,
I think the story should start from the 

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:34,120
rags to riches because when you do that,
then it's a sense and it makes sense.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,260
But the idea of just flossing,
you know,

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,543
hundreds and millions of dollars and 
then jumping on a plane and then a boat 

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,420
and the kids really think that,
you know,

10
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,960
it's your boat.
Um,

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,430
what I've learned,
because let me tell you something.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,670
This is what I've learned through my 
years.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,660
The people with the real money don't do 
any of that stuff.

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,523
Nine Times out of 10 they're in a room.
You won't even know who they are unless 

15
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:06,814
you hear people talking about them.
So the thing about it is when you've 

16
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,760
seen all this high rolling in you,
like,

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm going to tell you what a ty Cohen 
said,

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,980
tycoon has billions of dollars.
The tycoon said,

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,010
why clef?
You know what's funny about you guys?

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Y'All want to be us and we want to be 
young and that's the best way to explain

21
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:28,750
it.
You know what I'm saying?
