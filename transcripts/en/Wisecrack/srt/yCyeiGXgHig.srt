video.
Hey,

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,780
wise crack jared again.
Now I don't know about you,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,390
but every time a new Christopher Nolan 
movie comes out,

5
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,224
I happily shell out my harder and 25 
bucks for a sweet imax 70 millimeter 

6
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:15,384
experience.
There are few directors today that can 

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:19,830
meld thought provoking philosophy with 
big budgets,

8
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,630
spectacle,
but Nolan well,

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,910
he makes it look as easy as spinning a 
top.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,953
Now,
instead of focusing on one particular 

11
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,860
Nolan film,
we're going to take a step back and look

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,610
at his entire filmography because 
throughout all 10 of Nolan's movies,

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,250
certain themes keep coming back.
In fact,

14
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,084
there's so much to discuss.
We've pulled the ultimate Hollywood 

15
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:39,414
move.
Today's Christopher Nolan video will be 

16
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,110
the first of three on the director.
Now,

17
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,600
don't worry,
we're not pulling a hobbit and extending

18
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,760
a children's book into a seven hour 
trilogy.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,710
Think of this instead,
if you will,

20
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,544
as our Lord of the rings.
There's just so much great stuff to say 

21
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:57,330
about Nolan that we have to make three 
videos in order to do his work justice.

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
So sit back in your recliner chair and 
welcome to this epic wisecrack Imax 70 

23
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:05,190
millimeter presentation of the 
philosophy of Christopher Nolan,

24
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,950
part one,
and of course spoilers ahead,

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,963
Christopher.
Nolan's films can be broken down into 

26
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,450
three distinct phases,
the self,

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,670
society,
and the universe.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,593
The first phase we'll discuss the self 
includes Nolan's early work following 

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,180
Momento,
insomnia,

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,043
and the prestige as well as inception.
These films questioned the nature of 

31
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,650
personhood.
Can we ever truly know someone else?

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,440
Can we know ourselves in our own 
thoughts,

33
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,730
be trusted.
Hell,

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
what even is a person to better 
understand how these questions develop 

35
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:37,694
and Nolan's work.
We're first going to have to learn a 

36
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,774
little something about what French 
philosopher Paul record calls the 

37
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,600
hermeneutics of suspicion,
or as the cool kids say,

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,470
Hos hermeneutics studies how people 
interpret text.

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,363
Think of how a biblical verse can be 
interpreted any number of ways Christ's 

40
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,310
crucifixion could be thought of as an 
allegorical,

41
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,320
moral,
or even literal story.

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,230
Hermeneutics looks at all these 
different interpretations.

43
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,064
Focusing on the methodologies people use
to justify their interpretations and 

44
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,770
it's not just biblical texts,
legal,

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,570
literary,
philosophical.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,810
Pretty much any text you can think of 
falls within hermeneutics.

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,733
Heck,
I mean wisecrack is basically just one 

48
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,900
giant site dedicated to hermeneutics.
All we do is interpret text,

49
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,160
film,
television,

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,600
literature,
video games,

51
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,640
you name it,
but record questions.

52
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,180
These so called interpretations,
identifying a group of outside the box.

53
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,014
Philosophers committed to drawing out 
less visible and flattering Truett's 

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,393
record called this group the school of 
suspicion which sort of sounds like an 

55
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,654
erotic French thriller starring 
Charlotte rampling and Ludovic saying 

56
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,713
Yay,
but unfortunately it's just three dudes 

57
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,560
with facial hair,
Friedrich Nietzsche,

58
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,360
Karl Marx,
and Sigmund Freud.

59
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,930
According to record these figures and 
the lineage day inspired,

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,860
we're committed to unmasking the lies 
and illusions of consciousness.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,500
They circumvented self evident meanings 
in text,

62
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,363
focusing on what wasn't said and the 
contradictions within all to decode a 

63
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,000
true disguised meaning.
So while religious stories like Christ's

64
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,834
resurrection may seem to be about how 
man achieve salvation for the school of 

65
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:08,944
suspicion,
these stories disguised a hidden 

66
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,524
meaning.
Mark stated that the true purpose of 

67
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,570
religious narratives were to make the 
misery of life more endurable,

68
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,690
Micha unmasked religion as the refuge 
for the week,

69
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,553
giving purpose to the mentally fragile,
and Freud thought that religion was an 

70
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:27,670
illusion that substituted ones wished 
for a father with God.

71
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,520
Now yes,
hermeneutics of suspicion typically only

72
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:34,000
applies to text,
but it can be used more broadly to refer

73
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,834
to any so called interpretation.
We hold a self evident and what's more 

74
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,300
self evident and well ourselves.

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,253
Yes,
you youtube viewers watching this video 

76
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,730
with your eight tabs open and fidget,
spinner in hand,

77
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,623
what we drink,
watch where fink believe all inform how 

78
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:54,970
we interpret ourselves and others,
much like the Hos Nolan questions,

79
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,970
the conclusions that come from standard 
interpretations.

80
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,863
He confounds our assumed knowledge,
challenging our presuppositions to 

81
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,530
reveal deeper disguised truths about who
the hell we really are.

82
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,543
Nolan's films are always about that 
suspicious relation between our 

83
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,820
subjective reality and the idea of an 
objective reality.

84
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,893
Now,
this might sound like idealism to the 

85
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,364
philosophically inclined among you,
but we're not arguing that Nolan 

86
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,674
dismisses any external reality,
but rather he embraces a critical 

87
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,550
disposition toward the accepted notions 
of the self.

88
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,100
Take Christopher Nolan's debut following
the black and white indy follows billy,

89
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,033
a struggling writer who obsessively 
watched people from afar to get 

90
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:33,964
inspiration for his novel.
One day he follows a well dressed thief 

91
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,680
named cobb.
No,

92
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,020
not that one.
After he robbed a house,

93
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,460
cobb quickly notices billy watching,
but instead of running away or attacking

94
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,294
the stocker,
he invites billy to join in on his 

95
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,440
robberies.
Interested now see,

96
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,274
cobb is far less interested in stealing 
precious items than in figuring out the 

97
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,920
lives of people through their 
possessions,

98
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,120
freaking in entering someone's life,
finding out who they really are.

99
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,720
Both cobb and billy interpret and 
construct their own images of people,

100
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,723
Bill,
he by following strangers around and 

101
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:11,080
Cobb by breaking into people's homes and
rifling through their belongings.

102
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,063
But Nolan immediately questions.
If these conclusions hold any merit 

103
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,790
suggesting you can't rely on appearances
in possessions to define a person,

104
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,790
as cop himself says,
when burglarizing a house,

105
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,050
take it away for cub,
violating a person's property forces his

106
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,010
victims to reevaluate themselves.

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,933
When the possessions people hold dear 
are taken away or altered it in effect 

108
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:40,090
causes them to question their identity.
Nolan also questions peoples reliance on

109
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,750
appearances,
carb urges billy to cut his hair and don

110
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,584
his same suits which bill he immediately
does because he wants to be just like 

111
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,830
his mentor,
but this is all a setup.

112
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,813
The blonde woman is working with Cobb to
frame building the earlier break in and 

113
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,800
make over just a long con on the poor 
writer.

114
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,120
Billy's own presuppositions of cop are 
revealed to be false,

115
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,043
a far more dastardly intent lurking 
beneath his friendly smile and 

116
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,334
mentorship.

117
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,820
Compliment Nolan's

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,090
suspicion towards using possessions and 
appearance to define others carries over

119
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,030
to his next feature momento the film's 
protagonists.

120
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,590
Leonard suffers from anterograde Amnesia
and relies on a series of possessions,

121
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,970
photographs,
notes,

122
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,893
and tattoos to remind himself of who the
people around him are and whether they 

123
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,214
can be trusted.
Leonard puts complete faith in these 

124
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,710
items depending on them exclusively to 
guide his actions.

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
He trusts natalie because his notes tell
him to be kills teddy because again,

126
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,513
his notes tell him to.
He's the one he believes the car parked 

127
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:47,894
outside his,
his because he has a photograph that 

128
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,240
tells himself

129
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,280
my car is your car.
Oh,

130
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,530
you're in a playful mood,

131
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,150
but of course these momentos aren't 
nearly as reliable as Leonard belief.

132
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,030
He don't even know my name.
Teddy [inaudible].

133
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,590
You read it off of the picture.

134
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,543
Nolan,
in true hos fashion creates drama by 

135
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,680
throwing suspicion toward the validity 
of texts.

136
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,390
In this case,
photographs,

137
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,740
notes,
and tattoos.

138
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,880
How can we trust something we read if 
the source itself is questionable?

139
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,400
Truth is Natalie.
Can't be trusted.

140
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,390
That car parked out front actually 
doesn't belong to Leonard and Teddy.

141
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,560
Well,
he's not the guy.

142
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:25,870
Leonard could kill it all.
Leonard may say,

143
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,970
well,
I go on facts,

144
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:28,410
not recommendations,
but thank you,

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,150
but if the truths these facts are based 
on are incorrect,

146
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,043
then what use are they?
Nolan constantly draws a distinction 

147
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:40,010
between Leonard subjective reality and 
the idea of objective truth.

148
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,950
Well,
what we were trying to do is essentially

149
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:42,784
present a,
an idea of the tension between a 

150
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:48,604
subjective view of the world,
the subjective way in which we have to 

151
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:51,844
experience life,
and then our faith in an objective 

152
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,070
reality.
Beyond that,

153
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,183
in Leonard's subjective view,
he's a husband avenging the rape and 

154
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:04,520
murder of his wife after a break in,
but as the film reveals,

155
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,220
his wife actually survived this initial 
attack.

156
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,920
It was Leonard who accidentally killed 
his wife,

157
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,770
forgetting he had already given her her 
insulin shot.

158
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,813
Moreover,
Leonard actually already caught and 

159
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,840
murdered his wife's rapist over a year 
ago.

160
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,733
He uses text to trick himself into 
believing that this idealized revenge 

161
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,170
mission still exists.

162
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,083
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth like he 

163
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,183
police.
It was complete when I gave it to you 

164
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,330
who took out the 12 pages?
You know,

165
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,630
it wasn't me saying was you don't do 
that to create a puzzle.

166
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,770
You could never solve

167
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,733
Leonard conditions themselves to believe
in the lives he's created to the point 

168
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,620
where even his own longterm memories are
fabricated.

169
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,603
He substitutes the story of Sammy Jankis
for his own so he doesn't have to live 

170
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:52,190
with the guilt of accidentally murdering
his wife.

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,220
Nolan here extends the Hermeneutics of 
suspicion from simple texts.

172
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,040
Leonard's unreliable notes to Leonard 
himself,

173
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,930
his own false memories.

174
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,600
I lie to myself to be happy in your 
case,

175
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,470
Teddy.
Yes,

176
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,313
I will.

177
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,700
This suspicion continues into Nolan's 
third feature insomnia,

178
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,350
wherein Momento Leonard is an unreliable
narrator who's unable to discern reality

179
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,050
from his own fiction.
Insomnia's chief protagonists,

180
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,720
detective will.
Dormer seems to be the opposite.

181
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,640
He's reliable,
intelligent,

182
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:27,300
and perceptive,
but if momento focused on a broken man,

183
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,134
attempting to rebuild his sense of self 
insomnia takes the counter approach 

184
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,813
showing how even the most rock solid guy
like say an Alpha Chino can crumble in 

185
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:39,540
the self doubt with just a little push.

186
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,471
See,
madness,

187
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:43,710
as you know,
is like gravity.

188
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,950
All it takes is a little push

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,690
hold up ledger.
We'll get to you in part two anyway,

190
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,750
after will mistakenly shoots his partner
in the fog.

191
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,673
The guilt of the event triggers intense 
psychological confusion and well 

192
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:01,850
insomnia.
He hallucinates his dead partner room,

193
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,470
seemed to distort around will and 
everyday noises become blisteringly.

194
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:07,790
Irritating.
Later,

195
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,624
we'll hallucinates that he actually did 
see his partner in the fog and that he 

196
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:15,050
deliberately shot him.
Unlike momento insomnia,

197
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:18,260
provides no clear explanation about what
is true,

198
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,980
did will deliberately shoot his partner,
or was it just an accident?

199
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,070
The answer who knows Nolan yet again 
extends the Hermeneutics of suspicion.

200
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,783
Now questioning reality itself,
he implies it's much more complicated 

201
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:36,500
than just accepting either pure 
objectivity or subjective idealism.

202
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,210
Perhaps we can't ever be sure of the 
world around us by the end of insomnia.

203
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,050
Will doesn't even know if he 
deliberately shot his partner or not.

204
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,980
Did you mean to shoot hat anymore?

205
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,343
The Prestige is pretty much Nolan's 
greatest hits as he tackles all the 

206
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,990
hermeneutics of suspicion from his 
earlier work.

207
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
They'll film is told through a series of
journals,

208
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,640
many of which are fake.
Once again,

209
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:07,641
casting suspicion on good old texts,
all of the films magicians use disguises

210
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,574
to mask their tricks.
The Great Chung Lynn Sue pretends to be 

211
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,510
a cripple Alford borden where's 
disguises to mask that he has a twin and

212
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:16,344
both Alfred and his Frenemy,
Robert and repeatedly pretend to be 

213
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,160
audience members like in following and 
Momento.

214
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,750
Appearances can't be trusted and the 
self is constantly put into doubt.

215
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,390
Even Alfred's own wife doesn't know his 
secret,

216
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,320
confused that her husband could be so 
loving one day and so cold,

217
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:37,680
the next unaware of the existence of her
husband's twin.

218
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,700
I love you today.
Some days it's not true today.

219
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,970
You don't mean it.
I love you today.

220
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:46,804
It's true.

221
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,643
No one uses magic yet again to question 
subjective reality versus the idea of 

222
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,474
objective truth.
From the audience's subjective point of 

223
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:55,984
view,
the bird really does disappear and then 

224
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,710
reappear,
but in reality,

225
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:03,100
there were actually two twin birds,
one dead beneath the table,

226
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,800
the other reappearing and the magician's
hands.

227
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,913
No,

228
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,773
just asthma.
Mentos Leonard prefers to live in the 

229
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,280
illusion of is manipulated subjective 
reality.

230
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,550
The audience to prefers illusion over 
truth.

231
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,623
They don't want to know how Robert 
Literally duplicating himself each 

232
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,793
night,
murdering his double in a water tank 

233
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,044
beneath the stage.
They'd much rather live under the lie 

234
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:31,254
that Robert Disappears and then suddenly
reappears on the opposite end of the 

235
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,334
theater.

236
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,600
People actually believes the things I 
did on stage.

237
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,420
They wouldn't clap that screaming

238
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,423
as a filmmaker.
Nolan views himself like these 

239
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,810
magicians.
He plays with illusion and Mr.

240
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,890
Direction to keep the audience guessing.
We know that we're watching a movie,

241
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,753
a projection on a screen and illusion,
but we don't really want to know this 

242
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,134
truth,
so we revel in the imaginary world that 

243
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:58,164
Nolan has crafted.
This is what Nolan ultimately wants to 

244
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:04,050
affect the audience through trickery.
For him,

245
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,460
the truth deep down is that we prefer 
the imaginary over reality.

246
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,750
What is knows the truth,
solid

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,850
Nolan suspicion towards reality.
Climaxes in inception of film work,

248
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,230
every single thing is put into doubt.
That guy who looks like Tom Berenger,

249
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,820
well,
that's actually Tom Hardy,

250
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,550
can trust your eyes that thought you 
just had.

251
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,980
It's actually been implanted by Leonardo
Dicaprio.

252
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,220
Can't trust yourself,
your children waiting to play outside.

253
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,990
Actually,
it's all a dream.

254
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,290
Maybe can't trust anything.
Inceptions protagonists,

255
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,310
dream thief,
carb.

256
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,203
No,
not that one can barely discern his 

257
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,574
reality from a dream to the point where 
it doesn't even matter in Cobb's 

258
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,920
supposed reality,
he's on the run,

259
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,470
chased by goons with guns through 
Byzantine pathways in Cobb,

260
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:15,880
supposed to dream.
He's well still on the run,

261
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:18,730
chased by goons with guns through 
Byzantine pathways,

262
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,260
chase around the globe by anonymous 
corporations and these courses and where

263
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,740
the protections persecute the dream to 
me.

264
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,460
You don't believe in one reality 
anymore.

265
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,563
Nolan deliberately draws this parallel 
to showcase how muddled the two are put 

266
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:35,720
simply,
there is no difference between dream and

267
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:39,230
reality because subjectively cop can't 
tell the difference,

268
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,460
such as the fate for COBB's wife mall.
She believes that her reality is still a

269
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:46,070
dream and to wake up she must kill 
herself.

270
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,273
Possessed by an idea.
This one very simple idea and changed 

271
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:54,524
everything that our world wasn't real.
She needed to wake up to come back to 

272
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,214
reality,

273
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,010
but what is malts actually right?
What if cobb has been dreaming the whole

274
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:06,600
time?
What if you're wrong?

275
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,730
What if I'm.
What's real,

276
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,623
no definitive answer is ever given,
which is exactly Nolan's point in the 

277
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,393
end,
only the question remains that last 

278
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,160
indelible image of that Damn spinnings 
hopped,

279
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,330
spinning,
but just slightly wavering,

280
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,193
provides no definitive answer as to have
carb is dreaming or awake only further 

281
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,740
proving that in the end there is no 
truth,

282
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,740
no reality,
only the suspicion thereof,

283
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,750
well at least until we get to part 
three,

284
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,800
through each of Nolan's early films,
he casts doubt on appearances,

285
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,630
on possessions,
on others,

286
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,520
on ourselves,
on our thoughts,

287
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,443
and finally on reality,
but if you can't trust anybody else and 

288
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:46,434
you can't trust yourself and holy,
you can't even trust the reality 

289
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:51,900
surrounding you,
then how the hell does society function?

290
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,320
How can people come together and form a 
stable working unit?

291
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,810
Given the foundational bedrock is so 
wonky?

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,033
This is the question,
Nolan explorers through his dark knight 

293
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:01,764
trilogy,
which we'll explore in the next part of 

294
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:07,710
our own wise crack Nolan trilogy.
Thanks for watching guys piece.

295
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,220
Nolan is a master at making you question
your sanity,

296
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,520
but there's no reason your legal needs 
should make you feel that way.

process like it's nothing.

301
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,113
Legal Zoom eliminates the guesswork of 
trying to track down an attorney you 

302
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:31,734
trust,
calculating how much your legal work 

303
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:36,120
will cost in having to drag yourself to 
a lawyer's office.

304
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,043
Legal Zoom works with a network of 
independent attorneys to help you with 

305
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,240
all sorts of projects,
the formation of your company,

306
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,133
wills and trusts,
trademarks and patents contracts and 

307
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:45,870
more.

308
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,940
When we decided to do wisecrack full 
time,

309
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,480
the most important step was making sure 
our business was set up right.

310
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,643
Separating personal stuff from the 
company and navigating all the 

311
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:57,900
intricacies of state and local laws can 
be a huge pain,

312
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,793
but legal zoom offers the services and 
resources to make sure you get it done 

313
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,620
right.
