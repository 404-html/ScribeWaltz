1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,730
Hey wise cracks jared again,
like everyone else.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:08,340
Sometimes I just need to laugh the pain 
away.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,150
Often the crushing anxiety of existence 
may feel like too much,

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,490
but hey,
that's why I have a dog.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,620
It helps.
We are wise crack,

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,060
love us a month.
He Python,

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,163
these wildly bridge redefined comedy in 
the 1970s and are still hugely 

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,290
influential.
Just look at comedies today,

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,050
South Park,
rick and morty or even deadpool,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,033
all hilarious in their own unique ways,
but without Monte python they probably 

11
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:36,210
wouldn't even exist.
Monte Python paved the way for comedy as

12
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,044
we know it.
Combining absurdity satire and Post 

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,183
Warner reflexivity and the some of the 
most influential and quoted comedies 

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,733
ever an x.
So because there's nothing funnier than 

15
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:49,554
explaining a joke to death.
Welcome in his wise crack condition on 

16
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:53,430
the legacy of Monte Python.
Oh,

17
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,400
and we'll be answering your questions 
for the first hour and the comments.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,131
Soap Z,
you,

19
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:57,964
they're part one postmodernism,
like a hipster and a gluten free juice 

20
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,290
bar.
Postmodernism is everywhere these days.

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,660
Jurassic World Star Wars,
family guy.

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,613
Pretty much anything you can think of.
These films and TV shows constantly 

23
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,454
refer back to themselves,
commenting on the narrative conventions 

24
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,860
and iconography of their predecessors.
It's another desktop.

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,010
I wish that were the case major.
This was the death star and this is star

26
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,630
killer base or well just copying them 
wholesale,

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,200
but nothing encapsulates this movement 
more than deadpool.

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,183
Heck,
we even did an entire philosophy of on 

29
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,464
this exact subject,
everyone loves deadpool because quite 

30
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,090
simply he doesn't give up.
He's rebelliously self-aware,

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,770
repeatedly winking at his own narrative 
and mocking the superhero genre.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,580
Okay,
let's pro con this superhero thing.

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,423
This constant self reflexivity 
encapsulates postmodernism first coined 

34
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:58,770
by the French philosopher John Francois 
Leotard in 1979 for Leotard.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,830
All stories previously told fit into 
off,

36
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:02,664
told grand mythologies,
great heroes on a voyage for some 

37
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:08,840
grandiose goal,
or as he referred to them metanarratives

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,193
her leotard.
These metanarratives were stories that 

39
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:14,880
provided a pattern and structure for 
people's beliefs.

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,893
Teaching viewers a universal insight.
Think of the wizard of Oz and how when 

41
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,870
you strip it of all the flying monkeys 
and melting witches,

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,810
it's actually just a story about a girl 
realizing that

43
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,010
there's no place like,

44
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,810
or even the fast and the furious 
underneath all the ludicrous car stunts.

45
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,703
There's a deeper meta-narrative about 
the importance of family through these 

46
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:38,320
stories.
Morals and social customs are taught and

47
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,154
reinforced,
but postmodernism subverts these grand 

48
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,290
narratives revealing the chaos and 
disorder beneath,

49
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,363
like say Deadpool,
a comic book character who constantly 

50
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,260
tears down everything that comic book 
stand for.

51
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,283
You're probably thinking,
my boyfriend said this was a superhero 

52
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,434
movie,
but that guy in the red suit just turn 

53
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:57,170
that other guy into a Kebab.

54
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,173
But as edgy as deadpool may seem,
he ain't got shit on the pythons who 

55
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,380
took postmodern deconstruction to a 
whole other level.

56
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,790
Case in point there all time.
Classic Monty Python and the holy grail.

57
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,560
Whereas deadpool lampoons only the comic
book meta-narrative Monty Python and the

58
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,394
holy grail is defined by breaking down 
multiple Meta narratives among them are 

59
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:22,030
30 and chivalry,
Christianity logic,

60
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,013
and the very medium of film itself.
The first of these metanarratives are 

61
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,010
three in chivalry.
First of all,

62
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:28,844
from the late Middle Ages,
idealizing nights as honorable and self 

63
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,700
sacrificing.
You know,

64
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,280
the usual nightlys like protecting the 
week,

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,030
showing mercy to enemies,
never lying and championing truth,

66
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:40,864
injustice,
but monty python and the holy grail 

67
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,510
completely dismantles and mocks these 
time tested tenant.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,393
Who's that

69
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,773
when Sir Robin and counters,
a three headed giant is minstrel sing 

70
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:58,670
the heroic narrative that everyone 
expects.

71
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,380
He was not afraid to die,

72
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,060
but Robin himself runs the hell away as 
quickly as possible.

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,730
Great.
Good.

74
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,563
All good.

75
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,443
Similarly in the Arthurian legend,
Arthur's arrival at camelot is usually 

76
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:24,210
treated as an emotional high point in 
his story,

77
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,550
comma,
Tamil.

78
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,420
Yet monty python undercuts the 
seriousness of the moment,

79
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,660
turning this hallmark event into a goofy
musical number and then to top it off,

80
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,580
Arthur decides not to even bother going 
to camelot.

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,580
No,
I'm sick and bolts.

82
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,920
Let's not go to camelot.
It is a silly place.

83
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,953
Each of our supposed great heroes are 
revealed to be far less than they claim 

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,633
the power hungry.
Arthur demands that every peasant 

85
00:04:58,471 --> 00:04:59,820
acknowledge him as their king.

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,053
No king,

87
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,280
but if they dare question his rule,
he immediately attacks them.

88
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm being repressed.
Oh,

89
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,450
want to give it?
Why'd you have that Julia?

90
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,530
The,
that's what I'm on about sir.

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,570
Galahad the pure,
the most faithful of nights is to deuced

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,260
in less than four minutes by a company 
of 160 lonely women.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,110
And when Lancelot received a note from a
distressed maiden,

94
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,820
he rushes to rescue her in the process 
birders dozens of unarmed people.

95
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,983
Then in the end,
it turns out there wasn't even a maiden 

96
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:36,414
to save in the first place.
I told you I hopping on just find that 

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,553
monty python users,
postmodernism to illustrate how the 

98
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:43,314
stories people tell themselves enables 
some awful Lancelot and Arthur's own 

99
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,100
metanarratives justifying their violent 
and oppressive acts.

100
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,083
The fact that these men and narratives 
aren't even true to begin with is just 

101
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:56,550
the icing on the cake as our nightly 
heroes are revealed to be cowards,

102
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,010
hypocrites,
and violence.

103
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:58,880
Sociopaths.

104
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,640
Can you see what I mean?
I just get carried away.

105
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,710
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,840
Sorry.

107
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,673
Even God has put into doubt per the 
Christianity meta-narrative God is good 

108
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,010
and all powerful and has a plan for 
humanity.

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,850
Yet in monty python and the holy grail,
God isn't great.

110
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:15,684
Then kind at all.
He's just a cranky Dick who's really 

111
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:18,954
crappily animated philosopher Mikael 
boxton define this as the downward 

112
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,424
swing,
which I swear isn't a baseball term per 

113
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,733
boxton.
Most stories are upward swings and that 

114
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,870
they elevate a story,
toy,

115
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,390
symbolic state and make them universal.
On the contrary,

116
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:37,080
in a downward swing,
the classical story becomes so distorted

117
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:39,750
and grotesque that you don't even know 
whether to scream,

118
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:40,740
cry,
or laugh,

119
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,560
and it's not just the story that becomes
distorted,

120
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,650
but also we the readers and viewers 
ourselves.

121
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,730
Every lesson we learned through the Meta
narrative is now cast into doubt.

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,593
Right alongside it,
take one of the most famous scenes in 

123
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,500
the holy Grail,
the witch trial,

124
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,513
Sir Avir,
the ys puts a poor woman through a 

125
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:01,770
foolproof logic test in order to 
determine if she's a witch,

126
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,960
her bed,
a beer which is burned at the stake,

127
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,050
just like wood and wood floats on water,
just like a duck.

128
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,050
So if the woman is a,
which he will weigh the same as a duck,

129
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,400
Monte Python here takes formal logic and
distorted it into a grotesque version of

130
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,234
itself in effect,
casting doubt on our own fundamental 

131
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:20,550
faith in logic.
If classical logic can be distorted into

132
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:24,060
justifying a woman's death,
then how can it be truly trusted at all?

133
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,780
By the end of the Holy Grail,
this distortion extends to the very film

134
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,614
itself.
As Arthur prepares for an epic battle 

135
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:31,164
with the French at castle ard Modern Day
police suddenly arrive in arrest of the 

136
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:34,974
king for murder.
The beliefs then push and cover the 

137
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,430
camera Lens,
breaking the fourth wall,

138
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,430
making the audience cognitive to the 
fact they're watching a movie.

139
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,030
The holy grail constantly pokes fun at 
itself for being a movie.

140
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,133
For instance,
the film's title credits or undermined 

141
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:48,204
when Swedish subtitles suddenly appear 
promoting the country as a terrific 

142
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:52,320
vacation spot.

143
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,870
The credit makers are then promptly 
fired,

144
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,470
causing the credit format to completely 
change throughout the film.

145
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,304
Arthur Hughes's coconuts instead of 
eight course due to the films tight 

146
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:02,784
budget and later Arthur even refers to 
one character as we'll see in 2012 and 

147
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,730
just the hammer,
the point home,

148
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,520
the night's defeat,
the legendary black beast of art,

149
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,990
not through any battle or test of wills,
but because the anime or that design the

150
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,824
creature as a heart attack.
This self reflexivity reveals the holy 

151
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:24,330
grail to be its own metanarrative film 
just as artificial as the chivalrous are

152
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,530
30 in heroes with him.

153
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,960
Oh,
come on.

154
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,913
You Go.

155
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,263
That's just how postmodern monty python 
and the holy grail truly is it 

156
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:43,190
deconstructs religion and logic within a
deconstruction of heroic tropes within a

157
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,200
deconstruction of the film medium 
itself.

158
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,380
Basically the inception of postmodern 
phil part to the comedy of the absurd.

159
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,130
There's probably no show is popular on 
the interwebs as rick and morty.

160
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,110
I mean be honest.
Wisecracks really just the domain switch

161
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,944
away from becoming a rick and morty fan 
club and that's because the show always 

162
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,060
ties.
It's absurd.

163
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:07,410
Humor with thought provoking insights 
like well on the meaninglessness of life

164
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,403
as a bitch.
Take the get the episode when massive 

165
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,490
heads suddenly appear all across the 
planet,

166
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,210
many people begin to worship.
The head says God starting up a cult and

167
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,300
even sacrificing people to appease them.
Of course,

168
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,910
in reality,
these heads aren't gods at all,

169
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,893
but an alien race that just wants Earth 
to participate in an American idol like 

170
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,124
reality show.

171
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,610
This type of humor is known as the 
comedy of the absurd.

172
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,020
This existential base comedy focuses on 
the fallout when confronted with a world

173
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,550
devoid of meaning.
However,

174
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,520
instead of wallowing in some murky woe 
is me despair.

175
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,990
The absurd takes the opposite approach,
pointing out the broad humor and our own

176
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:46,824
tragic insignificance.
These tragic absurdity is foundational 

177
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:54,030
to Monty Python's brand of humor and 
their third feature of the life of Brian

178
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,863
Poor.
Brian's entire existence is one big 

179
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,714
absurd misunderstanding.
The humble peasant is born in the 

180
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:01,470
stable.
Next to Jesus,

181
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,080
confusing the three wiseman who assumed 
beaten,

182
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,700
not special at all.
Brian,

183
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,600
to be the messiah.

184
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,100
Here's the son of God,
King of the Jews,

185
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Catholic.
What is it?

186
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,283
The projection of significance on the 
insignificant is a hallmark of 

187
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,560
existential thought.
I particular our boy Albert Kamoo,

188
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,890
who rejected this desperate search for 
meaning and instead embraced the guest.

189
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,390
It absurd when Brian runs away from his 
disciples,

190
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,910
they mistakenly believe he's risen to 
heaven,

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,810
and later when Brian loses a sandal,
these same disciples per claim,

192
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,160
the Sandal,
his side.

193
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,500
Of course,
Brian didn't mean for the same old to be

194
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,334
anything more than footwear,
and yet people in their desire for 

195
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:45,090
meaning attribute significance to even 
the silliest of objects.

196
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,573
Will

197
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,943
we see this exact same misappropriation 
of meaning and get swifty as principal 

198
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,333
vagina and the rest of his colts mistake
the alien heads as gods when actually 

199
00:10:58,721 --> 00:10:59,554
they're only reality TV show junkies 
comedies of the absurd draw their humor 

200
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:04,024
from this discrepancy between what is 
and what isn't between what's true and 

201
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,194
what people believe to be true.
Characters in these absurd comedies are 

202
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:11,824
often caught in hopeless situations,
forced into repetitive and ultimately 

203
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:15,994
fruitless actions like Brian who 
constantly tries to tell his disciples 

204
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,060
he's not the Messiah,
but too little avail.

205
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,643
No matter what Brian does,
his disciples grow in number and become 

206
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,423
ever more fervent,
all leading to a horrific and tragic 

207
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,050
conclusion.
Crucifixion,

208
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,420
yet,
despite his impending doom,

209
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,403
Brian's comforted by his fellow 
crucifixion buddies who break out into 

210
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:42,290
song,

211
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,020
go wines.
Look on the Bra,

212
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,673
the Crucifixion Buddies,
cheerful lament reflects the myth of in 

213
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,920
which poor sisyphus is Kirsch to roll a 
rock up a mountain,

214
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,580
only for it to fall back down over and 
over again.

215
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,880
Camou famously applied the Greek men to 
life itself.

216
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,893
The trick though is not to let this 
meaninglessness ever gets you down 

217
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,220
instead.
In the words of life of Brian,

218
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,173
always look at the bright side because 
when faced with our own insignificance 

219
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:16,000
and impending doom,
there's only one real option.

220
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,510
Though it may seem completely absurd.
Laughter,

221
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,730
part three,
political satire.

222
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,060
Nowadays,
satire has become more vital than ever,

223
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,073
whether via late night talk shows like 
full frontal with Samantha Bee or more 

224
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,780
traditional half hour comedies like 
southpark hell.

225
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,890
The last three seasons of Southpark 
focused heavily on the 2016 election and

226
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,620
the trump presidency,
I don't give two shits about a treaty.

227
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:39,454
You're a Polish,
midget political satires like southpark 

228
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,303
derive their humor by revealing the 
hypocrisy in established rules and 

229
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:45,880
orders.

230
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,400
Allow the 2016 election and the PC 
brigade,

231
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,030
but way before South Park,
Monte Python paved the way,

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
subverting the established political 
ideologies of England.

233
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,410
In fact,
southpark creators,

234
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,244
Trey Parker and Matt Stone often cite 
Monte Python as the single biggest 

235
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,233
influence on their show.
Matt and I met and got along so well 

236
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,684
because we were just pure python freaks 
in Monte Python's final and darkest 

237
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:12,070
feature the meaning of life,
the pythons openly comment on English,

238
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,110
imperialism,
economic disparity,

239
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,750
and the classes,
social hierarchies of the country.

240
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,823
The opening mini movie be Crimson.
Permanent Assurance depicts a group of 

241
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:21,694
poor elderly workers forced into a 
pirate like frenzy by young American 

242
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,074
yuppies.
The old workers rebelled against these 

243
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
Yuppie Dick's,
throwing them out windows to their death

244
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,300
and then proceed to destroy every shiny 
bright corporate building in their path,

245
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,570
bringing down the system that literally 
anchored them to the ground.

246
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,820
The pythons carry the city miracle.

247
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,653
Look at capitalism throughout the film,
questioning the economic notion that 

248
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,220
self-interest results in the greater 
good.

249
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,070
In fact,
we see quite the opposite in the sketch,

250
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:48,904
the miracle of birth.
The doctors are far more concerned with 

251
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:51,934
their fancy equipment and impressing 
their administrator than the poor woman 

252
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:55,564
they're operating on.
I get the most expensive machines in 

253
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,740
case the administrator comes later in 
the sketch.

254
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:00,574
Live organ transplants to bureaucrats.
Fortunately remove the liver from an 

255
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,560
impoverished man for the good of the 
country,

256
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,940
remarking nonsensically that they must 
kill the guy that they can then take his

257
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:10,774
liver.

258
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,700
Met Him.
He constantly,

259
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,830
we see people drowning under this 
system.

260
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,240
Britain's Yorkshire is ironically 
referred to as a third world country and

261
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,074
in the same sketch,
a poor man is forced to sell off his 

262
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:29,320
children to science in order to make 
ends meet this economic disparity.

263
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,154
Climaxes in the sketch the autumn years 
or the grotesquely obese and rich Mr 

264
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,523
Creosote dines at a fancy restaurant 
eating more and more until he literally 

265
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,480
explodes.
The implications couldn't be clear.

266
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,070
The rich get richer and fatter at the 
expense of the starving lower class,

267
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,070
but it's not just social injustice that 
the python,

268
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,410
but the whole notion of British 
imperialism in general,

269
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,453
the hand of God strikes down a military 
officer who insists Britain will always 

270
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:02,840
need an army to put down differing 
ideologies and in the same sketch,

271
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,590
a sergeant major drills his platoon on 
whether they have anything better to do.

272
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,810
Then march up and down the town square.
Well,

273
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:09,644
it turns out they do.

274
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,200
Well,
to be quite honest.

275
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:16,201
Sij I'd rather be at home with the wife 
and kids now.

276
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,453
Yes,
Taj,

277
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,410
right off you go

278
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,210
like read a book or go to the movies or 
really anything at all.

279
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,480
The pythons even state this central 
thesis at the end of the picture.

280
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,290
I'm trying to be nice to people to avoid
eating fat.

281
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,183
Read a good book every now and then.
Get some walking in and try and live 

282
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,960
together in peace and harmony with 
people of all creeds and nations.

283
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,863
For the pythons.
British imperialism is a threat to the 

284
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,970
meaning of life.
This manifests in their depiction of war

285
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,230
where soldiers attempting to celebrate a
birthday our gun down one by one,

286
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,283
the brutal reality of war of supposed 
imperial conquests juxtaposed against 

287
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,820
the simple pleasure of enjoying a 
birthday cake.

288
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,760
These ideas extended their sketch show 
the flying circus.

289
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,713
The show often portrays bureaucrats is 
buffoons or as sticks in the mud 

290
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,580
constantly censoring the show itself.

291
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,350
Pet was to my nine of inquiry feathers.
She's getting to city.

292
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,310
It's silly.
It's silly,

293
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:09,760
it's silly,
right?

294
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,460
Get on with it.
Get on with this.

295
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,170
For hitchens,
one set,

296
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,213
the essential founding gag of monty 
python is the bubbling magma of 

297
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:23,090
absurdity that lay beneath the fragile 
crust of British reserve.

298
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,133
At any moment,
a man with a bowler hat or an umbrella 

299
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,600
might become a raging crossdresser or 
barking savers.

300
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,500
It's this unpredictability,
this mixture between the postmodern,

301
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,363
the political and the absurd that makes 
Monte Python unlike any comedy troop 

302
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,510
that came before or after.
By merging together social commentary,

303
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,210
existential angst and just plain old 
silliness.

304
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,820
The pythons always keep you on your 
toes.

305
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,970
They defied convention.
Concocting a brand of comedy,

306
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:54,971
so singular that a word has been created
just for that pythonesque today.

307
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:58,880
Their brand of humor permeates every 
facet of the comedic landscape.

308
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,890
As always.
Thanks for watching guys.

309
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,560
Peace.
