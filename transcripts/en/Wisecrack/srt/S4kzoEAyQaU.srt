00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,473
Yep.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,190
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,100
I am your host Garrick's,
where amyloid.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,330
This week's artifact is American psycho.
Based on the book by Bret Easton,

7
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:28,270
Ellis island storing weight loss guru 
Christian Bale.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,930
The film takes place in 1989.
Give or take a millennium.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,540
Our protagonist is human investment 
banker,

10
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,240
Patrick Batman,
and he's got it all.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,153
I'll legally blonde girlfriend,
two layers of skin and a brain disease 

12
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,260
that makes them old murdery.
One day his work friend,

13
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,540
jared Letterman,
gets his driver's license,

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,480
making Patrick's Learner's permit.
Look,

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,970
admittedly pretty condemned to bury the 
hatchet.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
He invites him over for some rhythm of 
the night and buries the hatchets.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,720
Patrick leaves a facetime audio cover up
and a grossly inaccurate terminator.

18
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,420
Impression,
baby.

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,683
Pretty soon,
Norman Osborn starts asking questions 

20
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,920
about Letterman's disappearance from 
late night,

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,380
if only to inject some plot.
Luckily,

22
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:15,700
he's not really into facts will just 
disappear and they leave it at that.

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,470
Later that night,
Patrick asks,

24
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,304
too lovable prostitutes to star in his 
porno Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and wraps 

25
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,490
production.
After the big coat hanger scene,

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,180
we're not through yet.
When the Hooli CEO gets his license,

27
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:32,680
Patrick hops back on the murder train,
but learns that he's gay and stops since

28
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,750
that would be a hate crime to clear his 
head.

29
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:38,980
He books the prostitute for a sequel,
but totally forgets to tidy up his pad.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,370
She's such a neat freak.
She leaves without taking her chainsaw,

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,580
forcing patrick to throw on some 
clothes,

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,643
turn it

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,503
the next night.
Patrick remembers his pin and forgets 

34
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,920
his cat.
When a woman tries to cut in line,

35
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:56,580
Batman tells her to wait and hell.
The fas asked what happened,

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,473
so patrick shows them he gives a janitor
and security guards some time off 

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,910
because he's such a nice guy,
and then booty calls his lawyer.

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,030
Whoops.
The following morning,

39
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,910
patrick shocked to find his place spic 
and span decks,

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
even though is Roomba broke forever ago.
The film ends with Patrick running into 

41
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:19,500
his lawyer and an astonishing Pepsi 
twist is revealed.

42
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,790
The lawyer doesn't charge for the our 
American psycho,

43
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,810
satirizes consumer as values through its
portrayal of Wall Street yuppies.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,760
Long before bitcoin became sentient and 
blew up Guam for Patrick and Co,

45
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,623
meaning comes through what you own 
reflecting the philosophy of Herbie 

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,350
fully loaded.
Mark,

47
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,720
who's up in his book,
one dimensional man,

48
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,583
he writes,
people recognize themselves in their 

49
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:43,770
commodities,
in their automobile.

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,770
Hi Fi set,
split level home and kitchen equipment.

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,800
Personally,
I recognize myself in my space,

52
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,950
Jacuzzi,
the film lampoons the trivial pursuit of

53
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:53,784
status.
When Batman and his colleagues compare 

54
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:59,160
business cards to the casual observer,
they're all Comic Sans,

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,750
but in Patrick's world,
this becomes a tense power,

56
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,760
struggle over the slightest 
distinctions.

57
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,210
That's subtle enough.
Way Coloring tasteful thing.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,260
Patrick,
you're sweating.

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,393
Similarly,
the traders have become 

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,190
indistinguishable from each other.
I mean,

61
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,280
they're all mammals to me and beneath 
the flashy exterior,

62
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,114
there's no substance.
I simply am not the film comments on 

63
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,890
humans' preoccupation with looking 
mighty fine.

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,490
Often on instagram.
People are so obsessed with Batman,

65
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,950
superficial qualities that they failed 
to notice.

66
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,440
He's gotten a haircut.
I'd like to dissect girls.

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,590
Did you know I'm utterly insane.
Great Tan Marcus.

68
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,130
I mean really impressive.
When Louis Sees Batman struggling with a

69
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:42,250
suspicious bag,
all he cares about is who designed it.

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,270
Where did you get that overnight bag?
The cost of his sheets is more important

71
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,970
than the fact that they are clearly 
covered in cranberry juice.

72
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,110
I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe.
These are using visual imagery.

73
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:53,944
The film draws a connection between 
Patrick's violent tendencies and his 

74
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,724
material girl ism what appears to be 
droplets of blood turns out to be a 

75
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,050
supreme really decadent sauce called 
Saracha.

76
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,133
Batman's call for dinner reservations is
juxtaposed with some pretty hardcore 

77
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,394
pornography.
Although I've seen worse when we see 

78
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,490
Batman's victims hanging in the closet 
like Valentino suits,

79
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,700
we realized that to him,
human beings have been reduced to a mere

80
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,280
commodities and a bold fashion 
statements.

81
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,830
As Patrick's behavior grows more 
erratic,

82
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,723
we begin to wonder how much of this 
documentary is real when he visits 

83
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,603
letterman's apartment,
rather than encountering bodies and 

84
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:31,264
blood soaked walls,
he meets only a realtor and a crazy low 

85
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,864
asking price,
and as lawyer appears to contradict his 

86
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,590
confession,
I killed.

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,100
That's simply not possible.
Why isn't it possible?

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,910
Because I had dinner with Paul Island 
twice in London just 10 days ago.

89
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,230
These disparities could suggest Batman's
world is so jaded towards money.

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,620
A realtor would whitewash a murder house
to get a good zillow.

91
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,010
It could also suggest Batman.
Story is a fantasy,

92
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,023
a warning that in such a culture,
the potential for maniacal violence 

93
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,860
could lurk inside any of them,

94
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,463
any of us.

95
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,870
