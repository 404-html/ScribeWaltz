1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
There's a statistic that over 90% of 
people go home at the end of the day 

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,004
feeling unfulfilled by their work.
This is the difference between liking 

3
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:11,020
your job and loving your job.
You can like your job,

4
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:14,220
but do you love your job?
And over 90% of the people who,

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,280
who work these days don't.
Um,

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,163
and I imagine a world in which that 
statistic is completely reversed in 

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:20,554
which the vast majority of people go 
home at the end of the day feeling 

8
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,154
fulfilled by the work that they do,
feeling that they've contributed to 

9
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,510
something bigger than the bigger than 
themselves.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,070
I've always been a pretty happy go lucky
guy.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,933
But about five years ago,
I reached a point in my career where my 

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,500
passion was gone.
Um,

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,423
I stopped loving what I was doing and I 
even got to the point where I didn't 

14
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:44,110
really like it anymore.
And for a happy person,

15
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,670
just being unhappy,
it was bad enough.

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,430
And it was this point in my life that I 
made this discovery,

17
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,264
this thing called the why.
And what I learned is that every single 

18
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,550
organization on the planet,
even our own careers,

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,400
function on three levels.
What we do,

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,170
how we do it,
and why we do it.

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,093
These are the things that we think make 
us different or special compared to 

22
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:04,024
everyone else.
But very few of us can clearly 

23
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:06,754
articulate why we do what we do.
And I don't mean to earn a living or 

24
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:12,400
provide for your family.
It was a results by why.

25
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,181
I mean,
what's your purpose?

26
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:14,380
What's your cause,
what's your belief?

27
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,243
And after I learned my why,
I literally stopped telling people what 

28
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,810
I did and only started telling them what
I believed.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,793
And not only was my passion restored,
but Mike Career and my life changed 

30
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:28,300
dramatically and took on an in an 
entirely new path with,

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,010
with,
with vastly more meaning.
