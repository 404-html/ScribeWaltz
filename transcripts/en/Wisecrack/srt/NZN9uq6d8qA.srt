1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,850
Have you ever won some asshole who needs
a haircut here?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,530
We just got back from deadpool two and 
one of the shares.

3
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:09,960
Some thoughts.
Is it funny?

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,003
Yes.
Is it the same thing as deadpool one 

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,240
except replace romance with family also?
Yes,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,163
but there's one particular scene we 
wanted to talk about it just for for 

7
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,254
Logan,
but deadpool two spoils logan pretty 

8
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,820
much immediately,
so consider yourself warned.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,953
At the beginning of the film,
deadpool holds a music box of Wolverine 

10
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,270
from the end of Logan.
It depicts him impaled upon a tree.

11
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,104
After defeating x 24,
he laments that Logan has stolen his 

12
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,340
fire,
so to make it right,

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,383
dead pool will also die.
Deadpool's Hugh Jackman obsession is 

14
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:41,550
well documented,
but in deadpool two,

15
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:42,384
it takes on a new layer of relevance.
One can view the entire film as one 

16
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,790
giant joke at Logan's expense.
So welcome to this wise crack quick take

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,120
on deadpool two,
and of course spoilers ahead,

00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,510

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,270
Thanks to wix again and now back to 
violence,

34
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,920
cynicism and fourth wall breaks.

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,143
So first a quick recap.
Deadpool two follows the MERC with a 

36
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:50,430
mouth as he's going through a bit of an 
emo phase.

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,383
His plans to start a family with Vanessa
Goto when she gets murdered by some bad 

38
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:59,190
guys after trying to kill himself,
he's brought on as an x men trainee.

39
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:02,400
Where he encounters a rotund young 
firestarter named Russell,

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,400
tired of being abused by his boarding 
school staff.

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,263
Russell starts lashing out.
Deadpool decides to dish out some 

42
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:12,150
vigilante justice on his abusers,
so he,

43
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:12,984
along with Russell,
end up in Buton prison with power 

44
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,014
inhibiting collars.
Deadpool breaks free when the time 

45
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,780
traveling cable infiltrates the prison 
to assassinate Russell.

46
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,883
Why?
Because it grows up to be a pretty big 

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
who kills cables,
wife and child.

48
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,960
After playing some cat and mouse russell
for sakes,

49
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:31,794
deadpool to join up with the juggernaut 
and kill his school master causing 

50
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,130
deadpool and cable to team up as part of
their deal.

51
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,940
Deadpool gets to try to stop Russell 
from killing his schoolmaster.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,890
Thus breaking the chain of events that 
turns him into key.

53
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:47,940
We voldemort if not cable,
gets to kill him.

54
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,860
When you put the two film side by side,
deadpool two is a lot like logan.

55
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,250
Besides the healing factor,
both films follow two mutants,

56
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,560
trying to help younger mutants being 
hunted down by guys.

57
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,543
It's also worth noting that both of 
these bad guys have robo arms slash 

58
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:04,654
hands.
Both films also have an adult child 

59
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,354
relationship.
Where the child is kind of a mirror for 

60
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,054
the protagonist,
Wade Wilson had a crappy family life 

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,160
which makes him empathetic to the 
orphans Russell,

62
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,520
who's only father figure conducts cruel 
experiments on him.

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,653
As a result,
he realizes Russell's and is beyond the 

64
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,720
child's choice and thus he deserves a 
chance.

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,930
Similarly,
Logan sympathizes with Laura because she

66
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,050
like him,
was engineered as a killing machine.

67
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,860
Both our heroes Die Sorta to save said 
child.

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,210
So here's the thing in logan and his 
sacrifice has a particular meaning,

69
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,980
one that we've covered before Logan and 
not set aside his violent past.

70
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,270
No matter how hard he tries,
he tries to spare laura the violent life

71
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,104
he had,
but can only do so by reluctantly 

72
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,104
becoming one last time.
The animal like Wolverine Logan and his 

73
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,370
Wolverine Fur Sona die so that Laura may
live.

74
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,890
This may sound a lot like Vanessa's 
line.

75
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,963
Give us a chance to be better than you 
used to be about how children give 

76
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,294
people the opportunity to make better 
versions of themselves and on the 

77
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,010
surface,
this is kind of happening,

78
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,090
at least in a,
did poorly in way deadpool.

79
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,933
Who has a violent past like wolverine 
does not want Russell to get that 

80
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,050
initial taste of murder because it will 
set him down a dark path.

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,033
Now,
does deadpool want Russell to avoid 

82
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,310
being a jaded hitman for higher?
Well,

83
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,130
not exactly.
He has to make sure Russell doesn't kill

84
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:30,964
his school master,
but he seems to have no problem doing 

85
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,870
the killing himself.
I mean,

86
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,310
this is deadpool.
After all,

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,353
at the end of the film,
we think deadpool has turned a new leaf 

88
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,110
and decided to spare the school master 
and perhaps take colossus words to heart

89
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,780
from early in the film that he's not 
judge,

90
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,720
jury and executioner,
and with deadpool sparing of him,

91
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,340
Hey,
it's progress,

92
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,503
but it was all a stall tactic so that 
depender could make like daisy Buchanan 

93
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,480
and commit some light vehicular 
manslaughter.

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,050
Just like the end of deadpool one.
Wade is still not.

95
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,884
Colossus is image of heroics,
but perhaps this comparison works on 

96
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,234
another level.
It Logan is about sparing a younger 

97
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,380
generation,
the violence of their elders.

98
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,190
Then deadpool two maybe about spearing a
younger generation,

99
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,260
the cynicism of their elders.

100
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,070
The idea that deadpool is cynical is 
pretty captain obvious,

101
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,980
inhabits all the tropes of a superhero 
wild,

102
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,400
mocking them.
He shamelessly advertises but does so in

103
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,980
a self deprecating style that makes it 
palatable.

104
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,053
In one instance,
Tequila ads had poorly plaster deadpool 

105
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,490
faces on them that we're an actual 
partnership.

106
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,230
He also,
above all else,

107
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,520
refuses to take anything seriously 
including his own torture.

108
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,280
If deadpool,
the character is so cynical,

109
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:49,780
so willing to trivialize everything,
perhaps it's because he never really had

110
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,614
a family.
This negative part of his character 

111
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,044
manifests itself and heightens the 
conflict when he belittles Russell 

112
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:59,360
within earshot and claims not to care 
about him,

113
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,230
and if this ill fitting role model has 
also abandoned Russell,

114
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,960
why should Russell think anyone could 
love him?

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,560
At the end of the film,
deadpool approaches Russell and embraces

116
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:13,820
him to try to stop his pyromania spree,
but Russell doesn't buy it,

117
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,170
and why should he?

118
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,050
All the adults in his life have been 
assholes.

119
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,333
The implication is because Russell 
doesn't trust anyone because he's never 

120
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,950
had a family.
He is without hope,

121
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,023
but when cable tries to shoot him dead,
pool takes the void proving to Russell 

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,433
that someone cares.
Not only does this mean he doesn't have 

123
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,430
to grow up and killed hundreds of 
people,

124
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,610
but that he should allow himself to 
trust others.

125
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,780
Logan died so that Laura could give up 
violence and have a good life with her.

126
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,614
New x family and deadpool died so 
russell could give up cynicism and 

127
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,294
embrace his new x family.
Logan will never not be violent and 

128
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,704
deadpool will never not be cynical,
but that doesn't mean we can't try to 

129
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,350
help the children.
But again,

130
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,680
this movie is a kind of extended joke on
Logan.

131
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,040
Although deadpool has healed the 
cynicism of Russell,

132
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,963
the film still takes the opposite 
approach rather than a sad heartfelt 

133
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,420
ending.

134
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,253
Deadpool doesn't actually die,
and the bait and switch with deadpool 

135
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,240
sparing the school master as a ruse to 
let dope hinder kill him.

136
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,620
It's just proof of this cynicism.
So where we expect progress,

137
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,010
we find none.
And if we had any doubts,

138
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,870
the after credit scenes show deadpool 
making the entire first act irrelevant.

139
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,510
And also shooting the old deadpool in 
the head,

140
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,860
so although deadpool may have saved 
Russell from these cynical belief in not

141
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:41,030
being able to trust anyone,
the franchise itself is still as cynical

142
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:41,864
as ever.
And I'm sure commercials like this and 

143
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,420
this will never go away,
but what do I know?

144
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,490
I'm just some asshole with a youtube 
channel.

145
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,720
Seriously,
go,

146
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,760
go read a book,
or hey,

147
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,030
make a website with your own thoughts by
clicking here.

148
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,010
Also,
we're going to be talking about deadpool

149
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,900
two on our podcast.
