00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,310
Hey,
why is cracked jared again?

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,233
Today we're talking about an insanely 
popular Halloween horror series 

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,940
guaranteed to make you barf up all your 
candy corn.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,983
No,
not the Emoji movie we're talking saw 

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,923
since 2004.
The torture porn he franchise has been 

9
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:27,470
locking up morally dubious characters in
all kinds of gruesome steel contraptions

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,590
and inventing creative new places to 
hide the keys.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,070
The creepy puppet master of the saw 
franchise is Jigsaw and boy does he love

12
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,904
playing games,
and by playing games we mean locking 

13
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:43,490
unconscious people inside Dank 
warehouses and giving them 60 seconds to

14
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:47,120
choose between certain death self 
mutilation or if they're lucky,

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,280
this embellishing a stranger.
When people talk about saw,

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
they tend to focus on jigsaws impressive
body counts,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,373
but just as you can pick through a pit 
of heroin syringes to find the hidden 

18
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,764
key,
you can sift through this villains 

19
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:01,730
deadly traps to find the grander meaning
of his game.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,060
Welcome this wisecrack edition on the 
philosophy of Saul,

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,223
and as always spoilers ahead.
The philosophy of saw all comes down to 

22
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,860
jigsaws.
Motivation is torturous.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,723
Games are opportunities for his victims 
to repent for their sins and ostensibly 

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,560
to transform into better human beings.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,820
They survive his tests and the odds are 
not quite ever in their favor.

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,510
He believes they'll emerge with a new 
found ability to appreciate life.

27
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,220
So basically if Tony Robbins had a baby 
with Satan,

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,383
in a sense,
jigsaw embodies a kind of extremist 

29
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,010
Christian morality.
But before we get there,

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,950
we first needed to get into the 
headspace of John Kramer.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,620
Alias the jigsaw killer.
Once upon a time,

32
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:50,454
John was a perfectly nice civil engineer
who loved hanging out with his pregnant 

33
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,360
wife,
Jill,

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,280
who owned a drug Rehab Clinic.
Then one of Joel's tweaked out patients,

35
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,114
Cecil Adam's robs her clinic 
accidentally injuring Jill in the 

36
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:04,770
process.
She suffers a miscarriage and John Falls

37
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,604
into a deep depression.
A short while after he's diagnosed with 

38
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:08,814
a brain tumor and terminal cancer,
he plummets further into depression and 

39
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,850
its relationship with jill quickly 
deteriorates.

40
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,020
Girl boy,
boy,

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,750
girl,
boy gets cold,

42
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:24,751
pregnant girl loses baby boy,
turns into a serial killer

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,930
and instead of joining tinder or 
something,

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Joe continues to entangle herself and 
her booze drama.

45
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,063
After an all around year,
John Tries to kill himself by driving 

46
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,750
off a cliff.
Miraculously,

47
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:40,560
he survived the crash and emerges 
totally sure of his new calling,

48
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,530
dispensing morality,
one torture device at a time.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,870
It's a moment that I decided to end my 
life,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,450
started me and my work and brought 
meaning to it,

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,523
and I was determined to spend the rest 
of my days testing the fabric of human 

52
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:53,424
nature as John cooked up a fresh coat of
morality to match his new mission in 

53
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:57,504
life.
He seems to have been inspired by an 

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
unlikely source early Christian 
philosophy.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,940
Specifically,
it's views on suffering.

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,013
According to early Christian tradition,
God is good in everything he created is 

57
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,064
good,
and nobody really questioned that until 

58
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:14,620
one day and an early Christian stubbed 
his toe and discovered suffering and was

59
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,910
like,
this sucks,

60
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,050
WTF God.

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,380
Once a bunch of Christian theologians 
started stubbing their toes,

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,273
they realized they needed to rationalize
how an all good God could have created 

63
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,144
such suffering.
They theorized that suffering had to be 

64
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,650
the fault of no good,
lousy humans.

65
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,783
Here's what they figured.
When Adam ate that apple from the tree 

66
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,870
of knowledge does committing the 
original sin.

67
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,763
He's separated dumb,
evil humans from the pure perfect God 

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,693
who apparently doesn't like it.
When humans eat a fresh healthy snack 

69
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,593
from then on,
sinful humans would need to suffer and 

70
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,830
repent if they wanted to be reunited 
with God.

71
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,540
Suffering then is the result of our own 
sins and an expression of the pain.

72
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,510
We feel over our separation from God in 
this way.

73
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:59,450
Traditional Christianity justified 
suffering as the fault of the sinner,

74
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,810
not of God.
Crisis averted.

75
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,973
Similarly,
Jigsaw thinks his victims deserve the 

76
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,554
suffering that they endure in his traps.
He helpfully reminds each victim of the 

77
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,860
sins they've committed to get there and 
he doesn't hold back.

78
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,950
As Jigsaw sees at his victims are 
enslaved by their past and morality,

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,470
not his industrial strength,
torture devices.

80
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,483
Much like theologians believe humanity 
had been trapped by Adam and Eve's 

81
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,273
original sin fittingly.
The saw series has a few atoms of its 

82
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:32,924
own.
In sophomore we learned that drug 

83
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:35,720
addicts,
Cecil Adams,

84
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,583
is responsible for Jill's miscarriage.
His original sin is a catalyst for 

85
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,920
John's transformation into jigsaw.
Additionally,

86
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:47,090
in the first film Adam stand height,
a photographer who spends his day spying

87
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,430
on people becomes one of jigsaws 
targets.

88
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,413
His professional quest for CD knowledge 
mirrors that of Adam's desire to eat 

89
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,004
from the tree,
so Kramer's view on human suffering 

90
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:00,230
shares a similar origin story to that 
have early Christians,

91
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,980
which hey could mean that watching some 
movies qualifies as attending church.

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,203
However,
John Kramer also shares a common thread 

93
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:09,230
with Christian theorist and father of 
existentialism,

94
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:12,770
Soren Kierkegaard,
who sees suffering as a critical part of

95
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,720
personal and spiritual growth.

96
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,943
For context,
much like Kramer Kicker Guard had his 

97
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:21,470
share of luck.
He had a lifelong physical deformity.

98
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:25,010
He watched his mother,
brothers and sisters die at a young age.

99
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,270
It became totally convinced that he was 
going to die at age 33 light Kramer.

100
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,220
He also broke up with the love of his 
life,

101
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,083
his then fiance regime,
yet continue to pine after her for the 

102
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:35,714
rest of his days.
Basically the two of them could have 

103
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,084
shared stories over whiskey.
They also both believe that suffering 

104
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:41,684
purifies the sufferer,
teaches them to appreciate life and 

105
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,910
forces them to take responsibility for 
their actions.

106
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,910
You might prefer your life without a 
generous dose of suffering,

107
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,773
but here are the guy out here regard,
believed that an individual must pass 

108
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:57,080
through three distinct phases to become 
his or her true self.

109
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,063
First,
the aesthetic driven by central 

110
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,030
pleasures and lacking any morality.
Seconds,

111
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,893
the ethical driven by morality and 
belief in individual responsibility and 

112
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,290
third,
the religious driven by faith in God.

113
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,333
So how do you go from being a lowly 
drunk aesthete to an upstanding ethical 

114
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:14,721
guy?
Well,

115
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,440
you can always try out one of jigsaws 
torture machines.

116
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,520
That's right.
According to Kierkegaard,

117
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,450
suffering is key to moving up to the 
next stage of human development.

118
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,643
Here could guard was mostly talking 
about spiritual and existential 

119
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:27,764
suffering,
not being caught in a torture device or 

120
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,910
worse.
Having people spoiled game of thrones

121
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,763
still jigsaws machines can be understood
as a test for each of his victims who 

122
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,220
are typically aesthetes driven by 
desires for sex,

123
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,120
drugs,
or money.

124
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,283
His testes present his victims with an 
ethical quandary that usually forced 

125
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:47,184
them to make a painful decision.
This matches the way cuter guard 

126
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:53,340
explains the journey from being an 
aesthetic to ethical being first,

127
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:57,030
the ethical life makes the suffer,
suffer even more than before.

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,953
Drawing him out of the frying pan and 
into the fire so that he really has 

129
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,840
something to scream about and only then 
does it help him,

130
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,470
but how exactly does suffering help you 
become more ethical?

131
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,483
According to Kierkegaard,
suffering forces a human to reflect on 

132
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,840
their situation.
If only to think,

133
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,610
oh,
this sucks,

134
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,430
that moment of reflection summons the 
first doubt,

135
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,210
which regard describes as the thought?
Why is this happening to me?

136
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,420
Can it not be otherwise?
Or to put more simply what's going on?

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,113
That little WTF moment generates the 
immediate desire to change your 

138
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:33,924
circumstance.
Desire opens a person up to a character 

139
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,060
guard,
calls ethical self.

140
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:41,894
Understanding suffering is growth 
inducing because it turns these single 

141
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:48,720
individual over to himself completely at
its most successful.

142
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,900
This suffering can force a person to 
repent for past sins,

143
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,740
take responsibility for his guilt and 
choose to seek his own survival,

144
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,340
but more on that later as you progress 
up the ladder of development,

145
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,690
a piece of your old false self dies,
much like the old Taylor swift

146
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,263
because she's dead.
Judging from his own interpretation of 

147
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:09,774
his car crash,
John Kramer agrees that a different 

148
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,190
person crawled out of the wreckage.
For Kierkegaard,

149
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:15,024
the ultimate goal of spiritual suffering
is to completely kill off your flawed 

150
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,163
false self in order to make room for 
your recreation it into a better truer 

151
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:23,154
self.
Kramer demands this of his most fervent 

152
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,010
follower,
Amanda,

153
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,350
when she agrees to live by his ethical 
code,

154
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,240
every cell in your body,
there is no turning back.

155
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,390
Amanda sits in a prayer like position 
listening deeply.

156
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,510
Diehard Saul fans called is seen 
Amanda's baptism,

157
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,140
which is fitting when you consider how 
baptism relates to suffering,

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,200
just as Jesus rose from the dead to 
redeem humanity.

159
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,170
Human beings are baptized and 
spiritually cleanse Christian tradition.

160
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,170
Also see suffering as a mechanism for 
spiritual cleansing.

161
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,260
Jigsaw frequently references this 
concept of rebirth,

162
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,153
whether he's chatting with his favorite 
disciple or welcoming a new victim into 

163
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,420
one of his traps.

164
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,373
Welcome to your rebirth tonight.
I give you the opportunity to face your 

165
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,080
upside.

166
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,913
Jigsaw even loses his kidnapping Virgin 
v during a literal celebration of 

167
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:25,040
rebirth,
the Chinese New Year celebration because

168
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,310
it's the year of the pig.
Kramer even picks up his sweet trademark

169
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:29,144
pig mask at the event.
Trigger guard and Jigsaw have a few 

170
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,650
other important ideas and common 
specifically.

171
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,484
They both value personal responsibility.
Kierkegaard writes that the first 

172
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:41,750
indispensable step of becoming a real 
man isn't getting strange new body hair,

173
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,170
but by becoming a responsible individual
before God,

174
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,183
Kramer demands the same from his victim 
and what's the key to taking 

175
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:56,380
responsibility,
making a choice,

176
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,470
Kramer Spurs his victims into life.
Affirming action

177
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,633
seems to me that two of your sons,
impending death is causing you to 

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,210
forgive his sins,
to wipe the slate clean.

179
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,340
Why is it that you're willing to do 
that?

180
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,470
When a life is at stake

181
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,413
in the moment of making a choice?
Kick regard believed that a man becomes 

182
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,770
himself.
Similarly,

183
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:20,670
Kramer is adamant that his victims 
choose their actions even ending each of

184
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:25,671
his games with this Yoda like refrain.
He also maintains that the individual is

185
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,654
responsible for the outcome of their 
decision within the confines of the 

186
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:39,300
game.
I've never murdered anyone in my life.

187
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,134
The decisions are up to them.
While many horror films offer an 

188
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,700
ultimate salvation

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,833
saw,
does not offer any kind of hope for a 

190
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,330
better tomorrow.
Instead,

191
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,164
it seems to critique this extreme 
version of traditional Christian 

192
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:54,614
morality.
Throughout the series Kramer's 

193
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,180
positioned as a god like figure monk or 
even martyr,

194
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,283
he dresses in a long black hooded cape 
acquires flocks of disciples and 

195
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,484
performed baptisms.
You also maintains the quality of 

196
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:09,050
omniscience.
He's always watching his victims through

197
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:13,400
camera monitors or people's,
so jigsaw may be a godlike figure,

198
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,234
but he's a seriously failed one.
His attempt to establish a moral order 

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,430
does not bring about meaningful change 
that kramer professes.

200
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,610
It will.
For starters,

201
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:23,444
most of his victims failed their tests.
They crumble under pressure or can't 

202
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:27,614
withstand the pain.
Those who do pass are frequently 

203
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:30,944
traumatized.

204
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,623
You want to know the best thing that 
happened to me after having to cut off 

205
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:41,471
my own,
our handicap parking at the mall.

206
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,913
Further revealing the full extent of 
jigsaws failure is this ill fated quest 

207
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,024
for the right apprentice.
Each of his contenders twists his 

208
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:54,040
philosophy while jigsaw creates games 
that are truly winnable.

209
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,933
If you follow the rules,
you can choose to preserve your life as 

210
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,500
long as you're willing to part with say 
your left arm.

211
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,543
His mentees on the other hand,
create rig games that are unwinnable 

212
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,204
death traps.
Blowing up Jake's last game was to get 

213
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:09,580
out.
Why was the door well to his disciples?

214
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,280
Just used the games to get revenge on 
people they don't like.

215
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,070
Eventually they all end up trapping and 
killing one another.

216
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,510
Adam,
jealousy to them,

217
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,450
the point of the Games is punishment 
rather than renewal.

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,433
So much for Jigsaw is legacy.
The characters in the Sol films 

219
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,620
frequently remind the audience that this
is a seriously flawed moral code.

220
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,620
You said you wanted to talk then you 
said you wanted to play a game.

221
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,453
You're talking,
but it means nothing just before her 

222
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,790
death.
Amanda Denounces Him.

223
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,130
Nobody is going.
Lastly,

224
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,560
because Jigsaw is presented as a god 
like figure,

225
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,320
you would expect that his justice be 
dispensed fairly,

226
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,333
but it's not.
He's the villain of the series and his 

227
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,620
morality lessons frequently sacrifice 
innocent human lives.

228
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,603
Similarly,
you'd expect his death to result in 

229
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,494
salvation or redemption,
but instead he dies after offering one 

230
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,010
of his victims,
Jeff,

231
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:01,790
the opportunity to forgive him instead 
get violently killed.

232
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,600
Scraper,
even Kramer's own death is the result of

233
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,580
one of his tests,
ultimate failures,

234
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,503
and he didn't even get to eat a tasty,
delicious apple so much for finding 

235
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,970
spiritual rebirth and a reverse bear 
trap.

236
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,470
Still plenty with seem to find value in 
less intensive experiences of suffering.

237
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,590
Just look at marathon runners or 
competitive hotdog eaters.

238
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,620
So when it comes to self improvement,
is it no pain,

239
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,170
no gain,
or will human suffering be eliminated?

240
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:30,070
Once we invent the perfect dual purpose 
food delivery and TV streaming APP?
