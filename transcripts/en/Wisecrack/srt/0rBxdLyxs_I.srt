Well,
we have an article in last month's art 

2
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:11,494
news about museums in China,
and there's hundreds of them coming all 

3
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,124
over China,
but they're not run the same way that 

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,693
Western museums are run.
The difference is that the people 

5
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:26,611
running western museums are coming out 
of a long history of kind of established

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,290
profession,
and they're kind of,

7
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,620
in China,
the standards are different,

8
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:35,080
so maybe the way they choose exhibitions
is different.

9
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:35,914
Maybe the way they approach the idea 
that there should be climate control is 

10
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:39,334
different.
Maybe the way that somebody gets into 

11
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:45,040
the position of director is different 
because maybe it's more political.

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,880
Maybe there's more government control of
what's going on in the exhibitions.
