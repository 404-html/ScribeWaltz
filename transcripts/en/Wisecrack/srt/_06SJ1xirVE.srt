1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,530
One of the things that's happened in 
business,

2
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,364
I think,
is that to the pursuit of shareholder 

3
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:21,310
value,
we've lost raison d'etre,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,620
Blair shepherd,
the Fuqua School of business,

5
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:28,621
Duke University.
If you get your resume dettra right,

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,850
it's not in conflict with making money,
it just,

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,090
it just frames how you do it right,
so that you do it in a way which is,

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,353
is more likely to sustain itself over 
time and more likely to contribute to 

9
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:42,764
society and larger sense.
Now it turns out you fail fast when 

10
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,600
you've lost your resin data.
So Arthur Anderson,

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,620
right the year before Arthur Anderson 
was put out of business.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,760
It was the number one company for most 
business schools in the world.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,130
Students wanting to go there.
Why?

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,193
Because they made a lot of money.
They were really professionally while 

15
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:08,690
developed.
It was a spectacular firm to work for,

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,040
but they forgot their resident Natura,
which was to ensure fairness,

17
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,830
honesty in the marketplace,
right?

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,723
Was to make sure that the numbers that 
were produced were numbers we could 

19
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,370
believe as soon as they forgot that they
failed overnight.

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,710
Enron failed overnight.
Um,

21
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,050
financial services firms fail overnight.
Why?

22
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:30,710
Because whole bunch of reasons didn't 
have the right risk controls in place.

23
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:31,311
They,
uh,

24
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,030
they forgot that,
that their brand matter,

25
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:34,864
they forgot that the franchise manner,
but at one level you could look at it 

26
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:40,160
and say they forgot the resin data.
Right?

27
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,580
And,
and so all I'm saying when I sort of say

28
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:47,680
there's a moral side of business is 
something that's straightforward,

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,720
which is remember why you're in business
and predicate every decision you make on

30
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:54,224
that as well as whether you're gonna 
make money and it turns out if you do 

31
00:01:57,741 --> 00:02:00,860
those two things together,
you will sustainably make money.

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,890
Forget the one you'll go out of business
overnight.

33
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,724
Forget the other,
you go to business because you won't 

34
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:09,810
have the cash to support the business 
right now.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,860
What they need to do is fix what's 
broken and invent the future,

36
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,380
right?
But as they come out of it,

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,483
the question of what's the mental model 
you should have for how you manage the 

38
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:21,864
success?
There is no question that what you need 

39
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:30,171
to do is innovate and call at the same 
time always what occurs,

40
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,100
unfortunately,
as,

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,430
as we get wealthy,
we forget to call.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,260
And so what has to happen then as you 
call in the worst of times,

43
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,950
which means layoffs because if you call 
in good times,

44
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,950
you can actually repurpose physical 
plant,

45
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:50,784
you can give people,
you can train people to put them in new 

46
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,454
jobs.
So if you,

47
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,480
if you do it when you're wealthy,
you can actually absorb the consequences

48
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,314
of calling,
but if you wait to bed to do your 

49
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,424
calling,
you're actually just gonna devastate 

50
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:05,290
both yourself as a firm in your employee
base and your customer base.

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,573
And so I think the issue is be 
disciplined at the same time you're 

52
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,594
being creative,

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,290
right?
Um,

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,463
and,
and if he can be discipline at the same 

55
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:14,904
time you're being creative,
you will prepare yourself for the next 

56
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:21,381
downturn because you'll be trim right 
where others won't be.

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,630
And,
uh,

58
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,463
and you'll just,
you'll just survive better through a 

59
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,114
difficult time.
