00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,380
This episode is brought to you by Oculus
rift.

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,820
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,830
I am your host.
Garrick's were ameloid.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,890
This week's artifact is avengers 
infinity war,

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,873
the crossover event that defined a 
generation until it was usurped by the 

6
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,050
Bridget Jones extended universe.
The film is a squeak wall,

7
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,110
so all your favorites or back Spiderman 
for Ilan Musk.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,670
Shrek girl,
Shrek,

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,920
cath man,
this guy,

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,060
they're all back.
Infinity war follows thin nose rather of

11
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:47,510
grimace who loves collecting rocks.
He loves them so much.

12
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:50,630
He straight up murders.
Heimdall and Heimdall is friend.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,940
While Shrek hightails it back to the 
swamp,

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,120
Aka Earth.
He conveniently lands in.

15
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:56,954
Doctor Strange is Bachelor Dojo and 
tells them winter is coming and it does 

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,653
in the form of [inaudible] kid brothers,
the avengers protect strange bling and 

17
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:07,454
take the fight to space.
The final frontier for humans in 

18
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,640
Scotland.
For some reason,

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,280
Wanda and cosmo get hammered

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,790
Bush,
but

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,623
captain America,
black widow and black man use their 

22
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,014
crotty powers to sufficient effect.
Cosmos suggests they cut the stone out 

23
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,394
of his head,
so they had to Africa for a little 

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,640
medical tourism in space.
The galaxy friends assault four in a hit

25
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,570
and run and with all their combined 
might they decide to split up.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,680
Half the crew tries to kill fenos but 
he's figured out their weakness.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,260
Bubbles,
unlike my weakness,

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,670
which is quite eludes,
he kidnaps lady Shrek while four and the

29
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,250
other guys do arts and crafts with 
Tyrian,

30
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,084
long esther spiderman and Ilan flash 
freeze voldemort and then crash land at 

31
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,020
[inaudible] ranch.
Along with these guys,

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,033
they concoct a plan to get back 
fantasies of admitted while strange has 

33
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:06,570
a math seizure.
Lady Shrek and Shrek Senior Meet Sunburn

34
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,403
Guy who tells him he's got a pawn,
his daughter for some rock over in 

35
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,450
Africa.
The other kids unleashed their army,

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,403
which they've just decided to use now 
back on tighten fenos returns to make 

37
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,920
sure he didn't leave the oven on when 
he's jumped.

38
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,380
The space x team nearly takes off as 
myth,

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,560
but quill finds out his g F has been m U
R D murdered.

40
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,540
That's faster.
Their plan goes to crap.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,853
Ilan gets knifed and strange gives up 
his chain for realizes he hasn't been 

42
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,960
doing anything for half the movie and 
day use.

43
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,630
Axe Maki na's into the battle.
Since the Wifi is terrible,

44
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,523
Wanda is forced to pop cosmos it,
but fan knows arrives and rewinds 

45
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,344
everything because be kind rewind man 
and with all the stones he snaps his 

46
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:54,684
fingers to that queen ditty but have 
them bump bump a fat that bottom girls 

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
avengers,
infinity war explores what happens when 

48
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,790
power is allowed to grow unchecked like 
that thing on your back.

49
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,680
I've been meaning to ask you about Karen
Ou fan.

50
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,370
Osu possesses many marks of power,
obsessed evil kings such as a lazy boy.

51
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,760
How is hated that chair lackeys who talk
weird.

52
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,863
No other beings has ever had them might 
ne the nobility wield not one to 

53
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,370
infinity stones and a jeweled gauntlet 
like the king of Pop.

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,263
Mikael Jackson.
He also acts in accordance with the 

55
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,504
principle of noblesse oblige the idea 
that nobility is duty bound to perform 

56
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,260
certain social responsibilities like 
genocide.

57
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,790
It's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite.

58
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,550
It's resources finite.
If life has left,

59
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:50,520
done shirked,
life will cease to exist

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,360
and ain't calculus and I should know I 
failed it twice.

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,643
This approach.
His sentiments from English scholar 

62
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,463
Thomas Mouth is are slithering and his 
essay on the principles of human 

63
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,034
population.
Martha's are believe that population 

64
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,214
could be contained through two methods,
proactive checks that increased 

65
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,084
mortality rates and preventative checks 
that decreased birth rates such as 

66
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,260
condoms and birkenstocks,
but like any good movie villain,

67
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,830
Fenos chooses the option that leads to 
more toy sales.

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,750
Fantas is a played Tony.
He invades plantings.

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,593
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out half the population and 

70
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:29,740
doing so.
Thanatos employees,

71
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,574
the old utilitarian argument that moral 
choices maximize happiness for the 

72
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,314
maximum amount of people.
By this logic murdering half the 

73
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:41,560
population is preferable to the whole 
population killing itself.

74
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,000
You were in the bed hungry,
scrounging for scraps.

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,970
Your planet was on the brink of 
collapse.

76
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm the one who stopped that.
You know what's happened since then?

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
The children born have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

78
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,980
It's a paradise,

79
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,850
although he could make the universe 
twice as big.

80
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,910
Screw it.
Ultimately,

81
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:05,744
the film criticizes both tennis's 
unchecked might and his utilitarian 

82
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,154
ideals,
but not his weird tunic and boot Combo 

83
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,903
is quest for power.
Forces him to choose between ambition 

84
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,480
and Familia.

85
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,650
The hardest choices require the 
strongest wounds.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,630
While he achieves his goal,
it costs him everything he holds dear.

87
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,640
Namely his daughter who's tried to 
murder him on multiple occasions.

88
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,373
Earthlink cinema.
I'm Garrick's where I'm your lawyer and 

89
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,120
now a word from my weird intern.

90
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,980
Hey guys,
Gareth's is turn.

91
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:38,814
Jared here.
My friends are always asking me what 

92
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,600
it's like to work for Garrick's.
Well,

93
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,870
it can be tough.
Technically I'm not even allowed to have

94
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:46,704
friends.
The only thing that gets me through is 

95
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,624
Garrick's is awesome collection of 
vintage earth artifacts like his oculus 

96
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:52,734
rift from 2018 back then it cost a mere 
$399 but as fond of saying at dinner 

97
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,900
parties,
it's priceless.

98
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,360
Now,
Garrick's has tons of games too,

99
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,520
including marvel powers,
united vr,

100
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,290
Lone Echo,
brass tactics,

101
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,124
echo arena,
and it seems like he's always getting 

102
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,100
more.
Unfortunately,

103
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,963
I'm forbidden to use it.
And Derek's busted me when I thought he 

104
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,740
was speaking at an intergalactic 
convention of Earth of files.

105
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,723
So now I'm trapped down here in his 
basement for what he describes as 

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,020
eternity.
Oh,

107
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,280
well,
it was worth it.

108
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,473
Check out the link in the video 
description to get more info on how to 

109
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,880
pick up one of your own.
If you can time travel back to 2018 that

110
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,714
is.
