1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,770
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,870
well I was still in my parent's basement
busily making money,

3
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:17,740
doing our audio visual stuff and I had 
an older brother at the time who was off

4
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:18,574
in medical school and he's extremely 
bright guy doing both an md and a phd 

5
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:28,611
program and his phd work was in 
developing therapies for pediatric,

6
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,590
in fact,
neonatal,

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,270
uh,
cancer patients,

8
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:38,271
babies with leukemia,
and he was developing the drug therapies

9
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:41,370
for these neonates,
but they're so small,

10
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,204
they weigh a couple of pounds.
There was no practical equipment out 

11
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:49,941
there for him to deliver his therapies.
So He'd show up in the basement on trips

12
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:51,294
home from med school and whine and 
complain about his lack of equipment 

13
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,344
designed for babies.
It wasn't surprising to me that there 

14
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,004
isn't a lot of equipment for babies 
because fortunately not a very large 

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,450
piece of the medical population.
Unfortunately old people get sick.

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,883
Babies don't normally have that problem,
but I could sit in the basement and 

17
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,224
imagine that I could build tiny,
tiny little drug delivery systems 

18
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,790
essentially using a syringe,
for instance,

19
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,220
as a whole day supply of drug instead of
an ivy bottle.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,833
So I built for my brothers some little 
devices that use the syringe as the 

21
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,454
reservoir and build some electronics and
control systems that would allow him to 

22
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:33,780
program those things for drug delivery 
for his research.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,933
I think he was very proud of my stuff.
I certainly wasn't doing it as a 

24
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,020
business.
I was helping my brother,

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,363
but he would take it to med schools with
him and he ended up doing a little time 

26
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,380
at Harvard where he met a lot of doctors
up in Boston.

27
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,214
Then he ended up doing a residency at 
Yale where he met a lot of the adult 

28
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,020
docs and one of these docs at one point 
said,

29
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,910
you know,
that little thing is so small,

30
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,670
it's great that it sits in an isolet 
moving around with babies,

31
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,163
but it's so small you could slap it on 
the belt or put it in the pocket of an 

32
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,274
adult who could walk around getting 
chronic therapy for things that might 

33
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,480
dramatically improve their healthcare.

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,620
Like what?
How about insulin for diabetics?

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,873
So suddenly I took this core technology 
that I developed for this very rare 

36
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,420
disease that we owe,
lots of people will,

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,910
will never have to deal with pediatric 
cancer,

38
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,343
and it would serve a very,
very broad population of people walking 

39
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:37,260
around meeting I insulin to deal with 
their diabetes.

40
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,490
And so we modified the pumps.
We moved out of the basement,

41
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:44,700
we started making lots of different,
uh,

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,953
pharmaceutical delivery systems,
ended up building an ice company around 

43
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,540
that.
And uh,

44
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,374
and to this day,
we continue to build stuff for home 

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,690
dialysis,
diabetes care.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,273
We build lots of products related to 
helping people get both better therapy 

47
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,220
and live better,
live simultaneous.
