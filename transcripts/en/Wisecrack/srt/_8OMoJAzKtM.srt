1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
The Buddhist psychology tradition in 
particular and the Asian psychologies in

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:05,934
general,
and actually the engine Christian 

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:12,411
monastic psychology's do have a strong 
theory and a strong practice really,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,090
uh,
of overcoming bitterness,

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,170
hatred,
resentment,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,033
vengefulness and so forth.
Carrying a little further for Moses has 

7
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,370
already restraining idea of an eye for 
an eye and tooth for tooth.

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,204
In other words,
you don't take a leg or a life for an 

9
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,150
eye,
you know,

10
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,620
or a life for it too.
It's,

11
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,810
you know,
just enough to do this,

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,073
which was already a step forward from 
the old engines idea of tribal attitude 

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,023
and a,
and Jesus has in Buddha's greater idea 

14
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:42,450
of really love your enemies and how to 
unpack that in a modern city.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,610
And people get nervous about it because 
they think if you love your enemies,

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,010
your meat,
it means you're going to cave to them.

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,843
You're going to be a martyr.
You're going to invite them to come and 

18
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,960
destroy you and just be a masochist 
sense of what.

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,123
And that is not at all.
But it means love means in the Asian 

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,933
psychological term that I think really 
in any term means the wish for the 

21
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:07,380
beloved happiness to want to make the 
one you love happy.

22
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,960
That's what love really is.
It isn't really greeted,

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,883
wished to possess,
although some kinds of loves tend to 

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,330
tend to mix with that of the egotistical
person.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,463
The reason someone is your enemy is they
think you are preventing their 

26
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:21,390
happiness.
Somehow you have something they want,

27
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,040
you're in their way.
Whatever it is.

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,070
The world isn't big enough for the both 
of you type of attitude.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,173
And so they want to be your enemy and 
because they are unhappy and they think 

30
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,350
by getting rid of you,
they will be happy.

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,070
So if they were happy already without 
messing with you,

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,940
they might be wanting to leave you alone
because it's no fun to go attack people.

33
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,770
It's like a,
it's,

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,210
it's an exercise,
you know,

35
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,330
it's not like giving a caress or 
receiving what so,

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,090
so loving your enemies is actually 
practical advice.

37
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,190
And Martin Luther King,
for example,

38
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:53,760
when he went back the second time,
that bridge in Birmingham,

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,810
a John Lewis says that he,
he was advised by his friends,

40
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,740
come on,
like,

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,930
don't get into how are we going to love 
those guys,

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,033
those cops who were sicking dogs and the
hoses and beating us and jailing us and 

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,520
torturing us and that then Martin Luther
said,

44
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,890
no,
uh,

45
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,510
Martin Luther King's that no,
it's too bitter.

46
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,530
A burden to bear hatred and resentment.
We do love them.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,633
Of course we opposed them and we're 
against them and we don't want them to 

48
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,380
behave like that,
but we don't hate them.

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,570
That's just a ridiculous waste of our 
energy.

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,973
And in a way,
you can see that being an enemy who has 

51
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,474
hurt you has already hurt you.
If you go around nursing hatred and 

52
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,060
vindictiveness and how to get back at 
them,

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,320
you're hurting yourself.
When you oppose your enemy who someone,

54
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,243
and,
and by,

55
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,540
by saying your enemies,
someone,

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,870
they think they're your enemy.
Hopefully if you love your enemy,

57
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,850
you have no enemy.
But if you,

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,830
when you oppose that person,
which you could do,

59
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,664
you could have tough love.
You can have fierce compassion and when 

60
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,980
they sense that you're doing it because 
you want their betterment actually,

61
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,820
cause it's not good them to be mean to 
you and so on,

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,150
then actually it has a little different 
edge to it.

63
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:04,984
And for example,
if you're trying to get them to see 

64
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,874
reason,
there's a better chance they'll be able 

65
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,154
to listen to you when they don't feel 
the weight of hatred and a destructive 

66
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,730
vibration toward them coming through the
speech.

67
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,370
They know what's in the style and the 
energy of his speech.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Your motivation will make it more 
successful.
