More on Luke crate at the end of the

00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,380
Hey,
wisecrack jared here.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,740
If you've been listening to our self 
park podcast,

7
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,430
respect our authortalk.
You know,

8
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:20,270
we've been low key obsessed with a 
really interesting problem south park is

9
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,104
facing this year.
How do you make social satire when 

10
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:26,330
reality is already so absurd and 
interviews?

11
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:27,164
Matt and Trey have noted that liberals 
and conservatives frequently praise the 

12
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:31,244
same episodes.
Each thinking of the show has secretly 

13
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,184
sided with them.
Then after season 20 was all been 

14
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,350
railroaded by the 2016 election.
Oh Jeez.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,050
This doesn't look very fun.
They made a new valve.

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,710
Avoid trump related narratives.
We don't want to be CNN.

17
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,544
They told the independent,
but with divisive politics dominating 

18
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,844
our national discourse.
Can a show that prides itself on not 

19
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:56,570
taking sides continue to stay relevant 
judging by their latest episode,

20
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,620
which manages to take a stance without 
resorting to partisan talking points?

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,630
The answer is absolute.

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,943
In fact,
this episode is one of my favorite 

23
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:09,650
indictments of trump on television and 
quite possibly one of the most nuanced.

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,663
Of course,
that's not to say they have anything 

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,100
uplifting to say because if there's any 
one consistent message this season,

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,220
it's that well,
we're all to death.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,083
Let's make this country great again.
Welcome this wise crack quick take on 

28
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:25,940
South Park's doubling down and as always
spoilers ahead.

29
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,923
But first a quick recap.
Heidi once again tries to end things 

30
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:34,090
with Eric probably for something petty.
Cogni or foreign pushed me in front of a

31
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,350
car.
As always,

32
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,184
he ugly cries and emotionally blackmail,
sir and just staying with him after 

33
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:39,994
watching cartman continue to abuse.
Heidi Kyle makes it his duty to rescue 

34
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,104
her.
It is our problem and eventually 

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,050
realizes he's fallen for her.
Meanwhile,

36
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:49,884
Paul Ryan,
Mitch Mcconnell and Mike Pence try to 

37
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,104
stand up to the president,
but garrison gives them a little taste 

38
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,630
of his signature.
Can people to death.

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,533
Hope you brought some condoms after some
illicit courtship Heidi dumps cartman 

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,550
gets with Kyle and carbon vows to take 
revenge on his least favorite too.

41
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,003
Things seem to be looking up for Heidi 
until her friends make her feel like 

42
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,020
forever dating carbon in the first 
place.

43
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,130
All the,
I told you,

44
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:25,900
so's make Heidi feel hurt and resentful,
causing her to double down on carbon.

45
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,943
Who presumably gives her an offscreen 
lecture about the merits of 

46
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,380
antisemitism.
It's hard to know for that.

47
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,960
People are always trying to get ahead 
covered in blankets and bruises.

48
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,883
Pence,
Ryan and Mcconnell commemorate 

49
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,330
garrison's first anniversary.
Yes.

50
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,164
As president and garrison reassures them
that the next three years will be even 

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,523
worse.
What's so brilliant about this episode 

52
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:48,030
is how the A and b plots parallel each 
other.

53
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,620
The main gist is just as Heidi is in an 
abusive relationship with Cartman,

54
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,520
so two are trump supporters in an 
abusive relationship with trump.

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,760
The parallel is hinted at early in the 
episode through subtly coded language.

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Kyle wondering why Heidi staying with 
Cartman asks,

57
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,110
she's still supporting him.
She loves him,

58
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,210
I guess,
but he clearly sucks.

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,550
Really sucks.
Whatever was going on

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,280
here are his wording is deliberately 
identical to be stock language.

61
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:18,240
Critics used to question why trump 
voters continue to support him.

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,193
Kyle.
Then straight up ask tidy what the deal 

63
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,940
is and here's where the parallel falls 
perfectly into place.

64
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,893
It turns out Heidi Hartmann,
like president garrison are about to 

65
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:28,440
celebrate their one year

66
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,453
bursary.
I know you and Carmen have an 

67
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:32,280
anniversary coming up and I just 
wondering,

68
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,200
you've known him.
How do you think he's doing?

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,360
Has a boyfriend?
Kyle presses the point,

70
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,194
again,
using language perfectly suited to 

71
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:39,354
trumps.
Some of us are thinking that maybe he's 

72
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,990
not super qualified to be with you

73
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,420
here.
Kyle was pretty clearly playing the role

74
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:48,030
of a liberal reporter interviewing a 
trump supporter.

75
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,023
One of the things about carbon that you 
find remotely redeeming this approach 

76
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:56,190
does not prove very tactful and Heidi 
doubles down on Cartman.

77
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,963
Great.
You don't know what Eric's like when 

78
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,890
we're alone.
He's actually really good to me.

79
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,823
Later in the episode we see the exact 
same exchange in a more familiar 

80
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:07,574
context.

81
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,463
Speaker Ryan,
it's the anniversary of the president 

82
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,120
being elected.
How do you think he's doing well?

83
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,520
What do you mean he's great?
We're doing great.

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
A lot of people judge him and just see 
the negative.

85
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,890
People don't know how great the 
president can be behind closed doors.

86
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,913
The irony becomes layered when just as 
kyle uses political polling lingo to 

87
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:25,784
talk about Cartman Paul Ryan starts 
using language associated with domestic 

88
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,290
abuse to protect trump

89
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,250
and is that semen on your black art?
Oh Nah,

90
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,970
I tripped on a tornado.
That's just,

91
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,960
that's thrown up.
Come

92
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,893
later.
Heidi finally admits to kyle that she 

93
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,320
may have made a mistake here.
Again,

94
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,154
her description of falling for cartman 
sounds like the description reporters 

95
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,580
use to explain how the white working 
class voter fail for trump.

96
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,250
Before we started going out,
he was in a really bad place.

97
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,773
I felt pushed away by society.
Famous guy came along who told me all 

98
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,490
the things I wanted to hear it.
We'll just wait with it.

99
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,830
Does that make me a bad person

100
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,933
here?
Kyle helpfully points out how cartman 

101
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,770
like trump constantly plays the victim 
to when sympathy.

102
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,693
No run.
We see ourselves as the victim 

103
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:12,554
sometimes,
but carbon sees himself as the victim 

104
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,590
all the time.
Meanwhile,

105
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:19,940
Heidis essentially the perfect stand in 
for the regretful trump voter who really

106
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:20,774
doesn't want to admit he was wrong.
I don't know how I'm going to face 

107
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:23,984
people with funding and we give up.
This culminates in a beautiful montage 

108
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,840
that essentially sums up the episode 
eight dejected.

109
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,674
Heidi evaluates her relationship and the
took her job's dudes cry watching trump 

110
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,740
on TV.
The message is clear.

111
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,723
Heidi represents the white working class
voter who is struggling to accept that 

112
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:41,654
banking on trump was a mistake,
but a glimmer of hope appears for both 

113
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,840
Heidi and the Republican leadership 
respectively.

114
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:51,560
A healthy relationship with kyle and 
garrison's dismal poll numbers.

115
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,730
We'll republican leaders and high he be 
able to escape their cycles of abuse,

116
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,850
not so as garrison says,
see,

117
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,684
I know something about societal 
psychology that you three turd balls 

118
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,130
down,
everything's gonna be fine.

119
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,400
What is garrison talking about first to 
preface,

120
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,330
something unique about South Park is the
nuanced way it critiques liberals.

121
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,540
Whereas due to the general liberal 
politics of Hollywood,

122
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,090
most satirical shows tend to mock 
conservatives.

123
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,043
That trend has been particularly true in
the past year when snl and others 

124
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
doubled down on trump theme lampoon or 
of course these shows are unlikely to 

125
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,520
resonate with even a vaguely regretful 
trump voter.

126
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,533
This climate is part of what has made 
Matt and Trey reluctant to constantly 

127
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,870
take easy shots at trump or his 
supporters this season,

128
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,763
which brings us to the dinner with Heidi
and her pouch who bombard her with an 

129
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,580
array of smug jokes about cartman's 
racism and sociopathic tendencies.

130
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,400
Ultimately all these antiques do is put 
Heidi on the defensive,

131
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,443
making her feel stupid.
Matt and Trey seem to be critiquing the 

132
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:58,500
way Hollywood has essentially declared 
open season on trump and his supporters.

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,633
This is most clearly expressed through.
Kyle will often acts as the metal voice 

134
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,110
of reason for the show.

135
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,330
You guys shouldn't criticize her so much
for going with carton.

136
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,503
Why not?
You're in Kirby's non verbal person 

137
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,210
trust yet he carved as much as any of 
you,

138
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,460
but just give her some space.
You know,

139
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,850
you can't keep saying we told you sell 
it because if you make her feel dumb,

140
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,520
she just doubles down and tries to prove
towards south and it wasn't done.

141
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,620
Here are the show

142
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,250
professors unambiguous disdain for 
trunk,

143
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,263
but seems to be urging the liberal media
to be less condescending toward trump 

144
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:29,420
voters.
Less eager to feel smug and say,

145
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,254
I told you so.
The girls should have heated kyle's 

146
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,104
warning because their comments during 
dinner made Heidi run right back to 

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,640
carbon.

148
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,473
I think maybe I am just stupid and I 
don't know what I want and it ends up 

149
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:41,560
partying.
People.

150
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,190
No,
you need to know something.

151
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,740
None of this is your fault

152
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,783
at this moment and isolated,
insecure Heidi is prime to believe 

153
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,624
whatever radical,
bigoted garbage carbon wants to serve 

154
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,340
up,
presumably like the voters she's come to

155
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:01,660
represent and a surprisingly well 
quaffed kyle is in for a surprise.

156
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,643
Just as trump has convinced his base to 
blame the left for everything that goes 

157
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:06,574
wrong with his presidency.
Carmen is convinced Heidi to make kyle 

158
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,940
her well,
Jewish scape goat.

159
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,360
You can't help it.
It's how you were raised,

160
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,420
what you were tying.
My heritage is Irish,

161
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,940
so I'm prone to being moody and your 
heritage.

162
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,200
You know,
you can be a little sneaky sometimes and

163
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,190
not even realize it.

164
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,150
Now a word on this episode's treatment 
of antisemitism.

165
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Of course,
Jew jokes have been carbons,

166
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,380
bread and butter since before Kenny's 
first death.

167
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,330
Yeah.
Hi.

168
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,163
Okay.
Yeah,

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,160
you'll have that by got Kobe fat.

170
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,283
This episode felt a little different.
Hardy's final speech to kyle is pretty 

171
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:42,214
shocking.
It's not loaded with the usual overt 

172
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:44,884
punchlines.
All we get is kyle looking pretty 

173
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:47,884
devastating.

174
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,400
Dude,
did she just call me a dirty Jew?

175
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,330
South Park's mockery of antisemites has 
never looked so dark,

176
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,070
which may be the shows way

177
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
of acknowledging how fundamentally 
different Hartman's character sounds 

178
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:00,354
since the rise of the alt right has 
southpark consciously graduated from 

179
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,553
goofy,
childish bigotry to genuinely ugly 

180
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,580
bigotry.
It seems like it.

181
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,950
In the meanwhile,
things are worse than ever.

182
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,813
Heidi is now completely controlled by 
Cartman and the Republicans and the 

183
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,970
nation are going to get with an even 
bigger strap on.

184
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,240
Things are looking pretty bleak,
but what do you guys think?

185
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,313
We'll regretful trump voters be shamed 
right back into his voting base or even 

186
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,070
worse.
Is there any hope for Heidi Paul Ryan or

187
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,963
any of us?
