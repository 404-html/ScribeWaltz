1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,273
Mm.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,350
Diversity is a pretty new term.
Very grateful for it.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,673
It,
it gets to something that is absolutely 

4
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:18,680
real and has been harder to discuss 
before it existed.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,143
That said,
I'm not sure I have a perfect 

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:21,884
definition.
It recognizes the fact that we are not 

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,280
singular,
that we are not all identical,

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,930
that we have a variation of,
of brands,

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,300
of connectivity,
of aptitudes,

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,223
of weaknesses,
of blind spots and of sensitivities and 

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,450
of capabilities.
People on the autism spectrum who are,

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,450
who are very functional,
uh,

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,323
in my experience,
tend to have extraordinary analytical 

14
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:54,581
skills and also often actually insight 
into social interactions.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,680
So long as they're not the ones 
participating.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,820
Uh,
and so you have an eye.

17
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,654
I've had a number of autistic students 
actually point out to me dynamics that 

18
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,210
were emerging in classrooms that I 
hadn't yet seen.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,030
And that once they were pointed out,
I could see a,

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,730
and these are the same students who have
a very hard time.

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,623
You're recognizing when it is or is not 
time to speak or get up or walk through 

22
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:17,864
the middle of the classroom and such.
There are a number of ways to be 

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,083
neurodiverse.
We have names for some conditions that 

24
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:25,790
actually represent,
uh,

25
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,440
ends of continuum.
Dyslexia is,

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,690
is a big one.
Um,

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,570
these are going to sound like they're 
coming out of left field,

28
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:36,404
but colorblindness left handedness in 
each of those cases being what in 

29
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:45,200
evolutionary biology we call the non 
dominant phenotype.

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,310
So I'm,
I'm a,

31
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,320
I'm a lefty.
That's,

32
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,210
that's the one of those that I belong to
as a group.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,433
And about 10% of people across all 
cultures that have been studied are 

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,440
lefthanded.
It's a persistent,

35
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,810
stable,
rare phenotype,

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,940
which suggests that it's adaptive,
that it's persistent,

37
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,774
it's complex and it is,
it provides the different wiring of the 

38
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,910
brain associated with being a 
lefthander,

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,033
uh,
provides benefit in the social group in 

40
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,440
which lefthander show up.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,083
We can put together analyses for why 
being a lefthander might allow you to 

42
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,704
approach a physical problem differently.
That a right hander would have a harder 

43
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:27,644
time solving,
but the different wiring of the brain 

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,260
allows for different approaches as well.
Similar with colorblindness,

45
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,420
that it might be really easy to say,
well,

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,420
okay,
that just is going to give you some,

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,093
some ability to see past color and to 
see patterns that aren't color-based 

48
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,890
perhaps.
But I suspect that there's wiring in the

49
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:46,724
brain that is associated with 
colorblindness that also allows for 

50
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:54,470
enhanced abilities that are different 
from those who are colors cited.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,200
Dyslexia for sure.
Right?

52
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,063
Dyslexia is obviously a very modern 
condition because writing is a very 

53
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,000
modern condition.
So as an evolutionary biologist,

54
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,800
when I say modern,
I mean thousands of years.

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,193
Um,
so dyslexia is modern in terms of 

56
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,290
thousands of years.
And um,

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,153
you know,
language was always about sound and 

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,700
never about writing until recently.
And so the,

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,650
the lesson,
the ability,

60
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,630
it's almost never an inability,
but the lesson,

61
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,464
the ability to process written symbols 
into meaning in your head looks to me 

62
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,243
like it's in trade off relationship with
the ability to engage in real time in 

63
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,174
speech.
And that's not to say that all of us 

64
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,690
can't learn through practice to be 
better at any number of these skills,

65
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,883
but that being born with what the world 
has is calling a deficit is almost 

66
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,634
always going to exist in trade off 
relationship with some often hidden 

67
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,700
strength.
Strength.

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,773
Yeah.
