1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,700
I'm to call him.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,060
What's up everybody?
Jared again,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,953
today we're talking about a show that's 
definitely going to get us d monetized 

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:13,320
on youtube.
Bursar based off the Monga,

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,840
the same name reserve is one of the 
oldest ongoing series out there.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,733
The Nma premiered in 1997 before going 
on an almost 20 year hiatus and as 

7
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,190
returned with a controversial new 
animation style.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,263
Since the show is still going,
we can't quite decipher the entire 

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,714
message here.
So while guts quest for revenge against 

10
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,444
the God hand in Griffith deals with some
fairly obvious themes ranging from 

11
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:35,590
religion to freewill.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,560
No,
no.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,800
Now that any meal,
no cause it to you to Dr [inaudible],

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,280
we're going to leave that for a future 
video instead.

15
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,114
We're here to talk about the most 
visually obvious and philosophically 

16
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:49,250
subtle aspect of the show.
That's right.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,950
Preserves metric crap,
ton of violence Wolgan Ms.

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,900
Wise crack condition on the philosophy 
of violence in Berzerk and as always,

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,030
spoilers ahead.
Now,

20
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:02,690
I know it might seem like the phrase 
mindless violence was coined to describe

21
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:03,524
Berzerk,
but what's going on beneath the surface 

22
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:09,470
of its bdsm inspired angels and gruesome
deaths is actually pretty smart.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,573
Reserve is unique not only in how it 
uses violence to horrify and mesmerize 

24
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,280
us,
but also to transform us.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,230
Do you understand the violence in 
Berzerk?

26
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:22,130
We need to consider its genre while the 
influences of psychological horror,

27
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:22,964
cosmic horror,
and even core porn can be seen in 

28
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,334
reserve.
The show specifically rests in horrors 

29
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:29,680
monster sub genre according to a 
stratasys,

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,560
no carol monster horror has two very 
important implications.

31
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,723
One,
horror as a genre affords us a critical 

32
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:40,130
distance allowing for a safe space for 
fascination to take root.

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,500
Simply put,
violence in real life is bad,

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,200
but violence on screen is kosher to the 
monsters depicted on screen embody.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,103
With Carol calls categorical violation.
They defy traditional categorizations 

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,760
and simultaneously attract and repulse 
for the same reason.

37
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,140
It's these two points that make Berzerk 
so well preserved.

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,183
Why are we okay with witnessing guts?
Literally slice people in half because 

39
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,180
we view this over the top violence from 
a safe distance and why do we find these

40
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,014
awful acts of violence so compelling?
Because violence in the show like it's 

41
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,290
subject matter defies traditional 
categorizations.

42
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,483
This blurring of typical categories and 
the fascination and repulsion that it 

43
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:20,774
generates is berzerk calling card.
These binaries can be distinctions 

44
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:24,824
between life and death,
such as when Guts Mo's down at group of 

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,950
animated skeletons or the distinction 
between man and beast and the apostles,

46
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,950
but they can also be less literal.
For example,

47
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:34,784
Father Mo's goose head bulging sadist,
extraordinary claims to be an agent of 

48
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:43,460
God but is actually serving the demons.
He and his rag tag team of tortures even

49
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,770
gain wings as if they're literally 
angels,

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,663
Lady Far Niece.
Now seeing the truth behind her order 

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,660
realizes what they actually are.

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,253
No,

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,593
even guts the epicenter,
the show's violence embodies this idea 

54
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
of categorical violation.
He's both a murderer and a hero and 

55
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:10,270
object of religious prophecy and an anti
religious crusader in the original anime

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,210
guts is branded as a ritual sacrifice 
for the god hand.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,730
A moment that was supposedly 
preordained,

58
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,720
but guts managed to defy faith and 
survive.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,913
Guts is simultaneously an object of 
religious prophecy and a middle finger 

60
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:32,671
against faith or as far DC originally 
sees him and how guts sees himself.

61
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,840
Cool.
Thank you.

62
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:43,674
Let's cut.
Can you cut a [inaudible] molecule down 

63
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,810
with day to day?
[inaudible] it okay.

64
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,063
And much like the man himself.
Guts is violence possesses this 

65
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,960
trademark sense of categorical 
violation.

66
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,570
It repels us.
Get attracts us.

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,910
It's animalistic,
yet refined.

68
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,103
This is most apparent when guts puts on 
the brazer armor and blurs the line 

69
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:10,304
between man and beast.
His armor even transforming to mirror 

70
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,874
this change.
As guts releases a savage cry and 

71
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:16,754
charges the battlefield,
he can't help but notice the compelling 

72
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:21,980
choreographed ferocity here as his 
opponent.

73
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:22,814
Grunfeld note

74
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,540
taken to sue Minneola new employee.

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,140
And when guts delivers the final blow of
the first bout,

76
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,590
he does so with a grace that is more 
than anything.

77
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,850
Well beautiful.
While it might seem strange,

78
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,743
according to thinker Joel Black and act 
of violence can in fact be beautiful in 

79
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,830
his book the aesthetics of murder.
He writes,

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,760
if any human act evokes the aesthetic 
experience of the sublime,

81
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,683
certainly it is the act of murder.
If murder can be experienced 

82
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:58,674
aesthetically,
the murderer can in turn be regarded as 

83
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,614
a kind of artist,
a performance artist or anti artists 

84
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:07,680
whose specialty is not creation but 
destruction.

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,993
Of course,
we're not giving the thumbs up to 

86
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,334
murder,
but blacks point is that when performed 

87
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:17,960
with the right craft style and force,
violence can have an almost transcendent

88
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,020
effect on its viewers.
This idea that something can leave us in

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,000
awe and transcend understanding is what 
philosopher Emmanuel Kant referred to as

90
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:31,650
the sublime or the state of mind created
when a certain experience stops being an

91
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:34,620
object of our judgment and starts 
controlling it.

92
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,530
Starting to sound familiar like monster 
hoard,

93
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:38,364
the sublime has the power to violate the
purpose in respect of the judgment and 

94
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,654
to do violence to the imagination.
It works through a process of 

95
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,404
categorical violation,
breaking down the divisions between our 

96
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:49,644
commonly held beliefs.
So how does the sublime and preserve 

97
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,730
transform us by forcing us to reconsider
our traditionally held ideas,

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,610
specifically beauty throughout both the 
new series and the 1997 version,

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,110
we are bombarded with intensely violence
images that are in their own way.

100
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,153
Beautiful.
When Griffith in his band of heroes are 

101
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,723
monsters liberate for tennis from the 
invading who Shaun's Griffith see or 

102
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,770
Sonia comments on the aftermath?

103
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,680
No,
you're this time.

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,950
Here are the senseless death and 
destruction wrought by griffiths army.

105
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Overwhelmed Sonia possessing a beauty 
that challenges her very idea of what is

106
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,430
through tapping into the sublime.
Violence in Berzerk frequently becomes a

107
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,264
vehicle for change.
Sonya opening her eyes to the dazzling 

108
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:49,984
death brought by griffith leaves her old
life in the village behind and follows 

109
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,690
griffith on his journey to become God 
kit,

110
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,973
but for Zurich is very careful to make 
sure it doesn't depict all violence as 

111
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,020
evoking this sense of awe.
In fact,

112
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:02,854
the show juxtaposes,
the artful killing of guts and griffith 

113
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,380
with ordinary violence,
seemingly common to everyday life,

114
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,663
whether it's the villagers stoning 
someone to death or a night whipping a 

115
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:14,230
prostitute from the comfort of his 
horse.

116
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,430
These moments are strangely mundane,
petty and underwhelming.

117
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,780
In the end,
these figures,

118
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:23,680
institutions lack the skill and artistry
to evoke the sublime.

119
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,600
If skill and craftsmanship are the keys 
to evoking total awe and wonder,

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,010
Ben Guts can be viewed as something like
a violent performance artists.

121
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,933
So what's the effect of guts?
Is a visceral and bloody art doesn't 

122
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,683
have a greater purpose or is it just as 
French writer tail field got ta calls 

123
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,580
art for Art's sake?
While it might be tempting to think it's

124
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,414
the latter,
guts is acts of violence do have a 

125
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,144
greater purpose demonstrating the 
hideous nature of the societal violence 

126
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,523
and ultimately disrupting it through the
distinction between artistic and non 

127
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,994
artistic acts of violence.
The show glorifies those that work 

128
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,413
against the grain of society,
contrasting them with the drab cruelty 

129
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:05,524
of the institutions themselves.
A prime example is griffith when he's 

130
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:09,604
reporting to the world fulfilling the 
wishes of the egg of the perfect world 

131
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,990
to up end of the world.
Order

132
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,910
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] no,
no to to cure.

133
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,220
So No [inaudible] statutes to Joe,
so stay [inaudible].

134
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,790
She was scared.
Touch

135
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,970
true to this cause.
Griffith and his army.

136
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:41,550
Take back for Tanis.
In this instance,

137
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:45,750
Griffith is working against society is 
upstart rebel army ousting the coo.

138
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:46,584
Sean's in one fell swoop,
but once Griffith Regan states the holy 

139
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:50,814
seize control of the city.
He becomes in meshed in the established 

140
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,174
power structure.
Typical the violence perpetrated by 

141
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,780
institutions.
Ribbons,

142
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,643
violence afterwards becomes tasteless 
and crude when guts and company arrived 

143
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,264
later at the city,
they find hundreds of slave traders 

144
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,310
hanged as enemies of the state bar from 
possessing beauty.

145
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,144
This scene is sterile,
methodically organized and revolting to 

146
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,830
sharecrop.
Unlike Griffith,

147
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,790
though guts is violence is never part of
a greater societal system.

148
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,660
Guts fights only for himself making 
enemies out of whole armies,

149
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,330
religions and even God like beings.
In fact,

150
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,164
the brand on guts is nick attracts 
demons and apostles continually forcing 

151
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,620
guts to abandoned society.
In the first episode,

152
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,280
guts attempts to reenter society by 
agreeing to take a carriage dried with a

153
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,114
kindly man and his daughter.
Guts falls asleep only for his brand to 

154
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,040
attract demons who slaughtered the 
father.

155
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,570
Daughter duo.
Instead,

156
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:43,404
guts is curse to live and act on the 
peripheries of society is violence 

157
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:49,410
becomes a destructive force upon the 
world.

158
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,543
Lady for niece realizes this.
When she becomes disillusioned with the 

159
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,371
holy,
see,

160
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,770
as all hell breaks loose on the 
battlefield.

161
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,520
Oh,
could I can let us know.

162
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,560
Mrs [inaudible]

163
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,283
Guts is violence invoking the sublime 
becomes a powerful force that disrupts 

164
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:10,724
the status quo and forces people to 
renegotiate their core ideals for far 

165
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,314
niece.
This results in her abandoning her post 

166
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,320
and even her God.

167
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,870
Could I take your statement

168
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,873
in tying artistic violence to the 
individual and unartistic violence to 

169
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:34,800
society for circus challenging us on 
where we focus our attention while we're

170
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,634
drawn to be shining brilliance of guts 
is violence or seemingly blind to the 

171
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,270
everyday violence that takes place in 
the greater world of Berserk.

172
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,730
We as viewers live for the battle 
scenes,

173
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,564
the crystallization of violence,
but this ignores the existence of 

174
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:49,254
structural violence or the idea that 
certain power structures can prevent 

175
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:56,040
less powerful groups of people from 
meeting their basic needs.

176
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,083
True to form.
Look who gets screwed over by society 

177
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,054
and preserve it should Doro is 
essentially forced into servitude being 

178
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:05,100
the glorified busboy of a mercenary 
group.

179
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,510
Costco essentially a mental invalid.
It's singled out for death by father,

180
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:10,344
most gurus and almost raped by a strange
fertility cult thing and Luca and her 

181
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:15,504
gaggle of young friends are forced to 
risk their lives by working as 

182
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,744
prostitutes at the base camp,
both servicing military officers while 

183
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:25,400
simultaneously fearing those are very 
officer's judgments for circus.

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,260
Challenging our ideas of what piece 
really is.

185
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,200
We like to think that peace begins when 
the battle stops,

186
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,063
when guts has finished putting his 
opponents through the proverbial 

187
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:34,704
blender,
but because we can't take our eyes away 

188
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:40,470
from dazzling acts of violence committed
by guts and others were unable to notice

189
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:43,710
or care about all the other acts of 
violence committed by society.

190
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,933
It's in the lols between battles when 
reserve decides to show us the artless 

191
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,490
and repulsive violence in the world 
around them.

192
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,000
In these rare moments when we see people
stoned death or mountains of dead bodies

193
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,720
or even a lake of blood and in trails,
we see the limitations of thinking.

194
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:01,930
That piece is simply the absence of war 
or battle.

195
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,720
But for all those complex intellectual 
ideas,

196
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,450
we don't blame you if you only remember 
preserve as the enemy.

197
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:12,280
We're an anthropomorphic horse lik say 
semi naked woman and there goes the last

198
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,690
of our youtube adsense revenue.
