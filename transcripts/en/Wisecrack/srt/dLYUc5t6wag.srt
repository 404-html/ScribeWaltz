00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,043
Hey,
wise crack jared here and I promise I'm 

5
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:14,684
not here to beat a dead Tauntaun.
As I'm sure everyone knows the last jet 

6
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,470
I pissed off a lot of fans and wise 
crack.

7
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:22,304
We've surfaced the usual rants.
Luke skywalker is suddenly a green milk 

8
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:26,654
chugging coward.
Snow gets darth Maul before we know 

9
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,180
anything about him.
Holos plan doesn't make any sense.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,050
The Canto bight section is boring.
Raised parents were red herring,

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,093
marvel humor for days.
This is hops and of course lay hoppins 

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,700
but we're not going to spend 15 minutes 
fanboy rages.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,090
Instead we're going to discuss how Ryan 
Johnson tried to revolutionize star wars

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,760
but did so what went wrong?
Well,

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,594
to answer that and we'll need a little 
help from a guy who in a roundabout way 

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,330
is responsible for making star wars star
wars.

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,830
Nope,
not that guy.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,220
This guy welcome this crack condition on
the last Jedi.

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,263
What went wrong and spoiler alert,
even though I already spoiled pretty 

20
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,700
much everything now,
before we jump in,

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,950
if you will allow me to get a little 
Meta on you.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,103
The relationship between Kylo Ren and 
Darth vader can be interpreted as a 

23
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,704
commentary on the relationship new star 
wars has with the original star wars 

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,350
that you will never be as strong as 
Darth Beta in the force awakens.

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,213
Kylo ren is burdened by the task of 
living up to the legend of his 

26
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:33,560
grandfather.
Just as the new series has the seemingly

27
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,280
impossible pressure of living up to the 
legacy of the original trilogy.

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,503
Just as Kylo ren mimics darth vader by 
dressing like him and using a voice 

29
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,554
modulator,
even though there's nothing wrong with 

30
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:44,744
his voice.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,400
So too does the force awakens mimic a 
new hope?

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,730
As many critics have noticed,
it's almost beat per beat.

33
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:55,550
The same movie.
This may seem like a stretch,

34
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:59,070
but the dynamic between smoke and Kylo 
in the opening of the last Jed,

35
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:03,520
I furthers this meter reading as snuck,
tells Kylo to take off the stupid masked

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,210
and that he shouldn't even bother 
anymore.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,073
Y'All know,
just a child and then ren breaks the 

38
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:19,640
mask a might as well go and throw Luke's
light saber off a cliff.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,773
Oh wait.
Johnson is telegraphing to his audience 

40
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,240
that this will no longer be a rehash of 
the original trilogy.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,373
The film will be a radical subversion of
the star wars formula for the new star 

42
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,920
wars to live the old star wars must die,

43
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,320
but the time if you have to

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,773
with the last Jedi,
Brian Johnson isn't interested in 

45
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,150
recycling old star wars.
He's interested in progress,

46
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,430
not only progressing the franchise 
itself,

47
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,890
but the landscape of a certain galaxy 
far,

48
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,680
far away.
In order to progress the franchise,

49
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,543
Johnson abrasively undermines the troops
and traditions that characterize the 

50
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,100
previous fields.
Whereas Luke Skywalker,

51
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,880
the son of noble blood raise parents are
just degenerate.

52
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,881
Why knows nobody filthy junk traders.
So do you offer drinking money?

53
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,743
Our heroes are now janitors and 
mechanics instead of politicians and 

54
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,140
princesses.
Luke is no longer the idealistic hero.

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,440
He's a failed nephew,
murderer slash Slovenian philosopher,

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,390
Yoda.
It goes from symbol of Jedi.

57
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,680
Heidi two would be booked burner and the
jet I order kind of sucks.

58
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,920
Lesson two,
now that they're extinct,

59
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,783
the jet I or romanticize deified.
If you strip away the myth and look at 

60
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:38,110
their deeds legacy,
if the Jeddah is failure,

61
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,150
hypocrisy,
Hubris,

62
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,340
that's not true.
At the height of their powers,

63
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,020
they allow.city
has to rise,

64
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:48,310
create the empire and wipe them out.
It was a Jedi master who was responsible

65
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,300
for the training,

66
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,200
ub Darth vader.
So you might be asking why on everything

67
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,210
that defined the previous films.
Well,

68
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:59,720
because turns out the events of the 
previous films didn't really lead to any

69
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:02,060
progress.
After the collapse of the empire,

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,080
a nearly identical Nazi inspired 
fascistic order has risen.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,620
So clearly something is wrong in the 
galaxy if this keeps happening.

72
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,560
So what's to blame for this reemergence 
of evil?

73
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,603
Well,
Johnson seems to suggest it's are 

74
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,570
inadequate conception of good and evil.
But wait,

75
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,463
start divisions between good and evil 
are what the entire star wars mythology 

76
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,840
has been built around.
It's the dark side,

77
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,430
not the dark nuance.

78
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,470
And here's where the movie almost gets 
really smart.

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,633
As many of you may know,
George Lucas crafted the original 

80
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:34,514
trilogy point for point around a book 
called the hero with a thousand faces 

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,953
written by Joseph Campbell.
The book sets forth a kind of universal 

82
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:45,410
story structure from which myth stories 
and literature all borrow,

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,200
which is why the structure is called the
monomyth,

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,393
but instead of simply recycling 
Campbell's monomyth as seen in the 

85
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:52,844
original trilogy,
Johnson uses it to complicate our 

86
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:57,140
relationship with a dark side.
You see,

87
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:59,930
Campbell's monomyth is based on the work
of psychoanalysts.

88
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:00,764
Carl,
you wrote about ideas like the 

89
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:02,804
collective unconscious and archetypes,
universal primordial images ingrained 

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,393
deep in our psyche.
Those archetypes for Campbell informed 

91
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:10,964
the kind of characters that keep popping
up in stories across continents and 

92
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:14,894
cultures.
So let's talk about one of those 

93
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,410
archetypes,
the shadow and how the last,

94
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,244
Jed,
I tries to radically redefine our 

95
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:21,500
relationship to it.

96
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,603
For you and the shadow is the primal or 
animal part of our unconscious that 

97
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:28,130
tends to get repressed.
The dark side.

98
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,220
See where we're going with this.
In the monomyth,

99
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,063
this dark side usually gets embodied by 
a character who represents the 

100
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,640
shortcomings,
fears,

101
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:39,200
and anxieties of our protagonist.
Gollum is frodos shadow a stark reminder

102
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:42,050
of what he could become.
But if you really want shadows,

103
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,560
one o one look no further than darth 
vader and Luke Skywalker.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,390
Darth vader was once a powerful Jedi who
succumbed to the dark side for Luke.

105
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,224
Darth vader serves as a constant 
reminder of what he could become if it 

106
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,930
does not conquer his fear.
And Master has passions.

107
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,950
So confronting darth vader is more than 
just a physical confrontation.

108
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,720
It's an emotional and psychological one.
It's why Luke spares darth vader's life.

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,800
If he were to strike him down in anger,
then he's lost the battle with his inner

110
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,470
demons.
But we're as the old star wars wants you

111
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:17,230
to conquer your inner demons.
The new star wars has other ideas in all

112
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,083
the films were meant to believe.
That balance in the force is desirable 

113
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:24,200
for the good of the galaxy.
You refer to the prophecy of the one who

114
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:28,610
will bring balance to the force.
You believe it's this boy.

115
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,370
However,
the last Jedi suggests that the forces,

116
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,770
something that inherently promotes 
balance.

117
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,460
When the darkness rises,
the force amplifies the light to balance

118
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:42,461
it out.
Darkness rises to meet.

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,933
I warned my young apprentice that as he 
grew stronger is equally in the light 

120
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,040
would rise if we're to believe snuck 
here.

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,993
Wouldn't that mean that the inverse is 
true than any powerful Jedi order would 

122
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,670
be met with an equally powerful dark 
side?

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,713
If so,
we have no choice but to read Luke's 

124
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,144
criticism of the Jedi order as one that 
blames them in part for the cyclical 

125
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:12,830
rise and fall of these fascist empires.
While it's kind of ambiguous,

126
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,530
this logical conclusion seems to be 
hinted at by Luke.

127
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,523
Yes.
The lesson that fourth not bombed the 

128
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,923
jet.
I to say that at the jet I died a light 

129
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,660
diocese bannock feel that

130
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,663
with episode eight the dark side is no 
longer something to be conquered by the 

131
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,790
valeant jetta.
I at the behest of the light side,

132
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,653
because that will make the force over 
correct to achieve balance leading to 

133
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,790
more amplifications of evil.
According to union analyst Robert H.

134
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,100
Johnson.
Not to be confused with Ryan Johnson,

135
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,360
we shouldn't think of our dark sides as 
something to merely conquer and expunge.

136
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,553
Johnson says this,
active repression causes us to 

137
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,133
accumulate the darkness,
which creates an ego split according to 

138
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,170
his reading of Ume.
When you suppress the darkness,

139
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,630
you're forced to find a scape goat 
project,

140
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,590
all your own ugliness onto them leading 
to a never ending fight.

141
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,993
This is quite literally done in the very
way the original star wars is written 

142
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,020
with Luke's inner demons projected onto 
an evil space wizard.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,830
Instead of maintaining this classic 
distinction between good and bad,

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,530
both within our characters and in the 
general plot,

145
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,100
Ryan Johnson tries to complicate it at 
every step of the way.

146
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,353
As we see,
conquering evil with good hasn't done 

147
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,670
much for the galaxy.
The empire is basically back with a sexy

148
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,030
new rebranding and snuck is basically 
palpatine 2.0

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,193
in earlier star wars deek.
Good bad distinction is literally black 

150
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,913
and white,
and thus the force awakens brings us 

151
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:45,260
right back to where we started.
So to progress the franchise.

152
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,140
Ryan Johnson tweaks the basic youngest 
formula.

153
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,303
If you suggested that we must reconcile 
our dark side with the rest of our 

154
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,174
personality.
Does the galaxy need to reconcile it's 

155
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,630
dark side with the larger order of 
things?

156
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,440
Oh,
US

157
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,680
consider Benicio del Toro's character 
Dj.

158
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,693
Rather than upholding the traditional 
distinction between purely good rebels 

159
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,473
and purely evil oppressors,
he explores how even the good guys can 

160
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,584
get caught up in the darker elements of 
the universe as the galaxies very own 

161
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:17,484
blackwater mercenary,
the cynical Dj sees through the false 

162
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:23,130
divisions of good and evil.
At least you're stealing from them

163
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,020
bad guys and helping the good,
good guys.

164
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,093
Bad guys made up words.
Let's see who formally owned his own an 

165
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,070
arms dealer made his bag selling weapons
to the back.

166
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:43,904
Guys

167
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,333
under good.
This marks the most morally ambiguous 

168
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:52,314
moments in any star wars film when he 
not only suggest that divisions between 

169
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,930
good and evil are insincere and 
unhelpful,

170
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,920
but complicates our understanding of the
rebellion as an infallible good.

171
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,083
Robert Johnson sees our traditional 
understanding of the light and dark 

172
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:06,924
sides as straight up dangerous.
He says that our inability to reconcile 

173
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,004
with our shadow and therefore our 
eventual scapegoating on to others will 

174
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:18,370
inevitably end in violence,
war and racism for the last Jed,

175
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:20,760
I rather than the good guys and bad 
guys,

176
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,420
there's a system at play his own machine
partner,

177
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,420
live free,
don't join.

178
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,770
It becomes the first star wars film to 
explicitly critique the galaxies,

179
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:37,270
military economy and the exploitation 
and animal rights violations inherent in

180
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,790
it,
which even heroes like Princess Leia are

181
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,610
party to then shelled us to test their 
weapons.

182
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,540
So you might be asking at this point,
aside from being too ballsy,

183
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,070
what one wrong?
Well,

184
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:51,820
the movie goes out of its way to in both
form and content,

185
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,840
tell us that we must kill the past,
whether it be the past structure of star

186
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:59,260
wars films or the moral lens we 
understood the previous films through,

187
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,530
then this happens.
It's time to little things.

188
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:03,364
Die,

189
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:11,070
smoke Skywalker,
Jed,

190
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,460
I the rebels,
let it all die,

191
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,770
right?
I want you to join me.

192
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,033
Ray is given a chance to end all the 
dogmatism of the previous films and yet 

193
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,730
she says No.
And from this point on,

194
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,980
it's all back peddle central.
Nope.

195
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,140
No,
you're still holding on.

196
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,640
All the things that we were convinced 
need to be killed are reaffirmed,

197
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,730
tearing down the heroic archetypes 
inherent in the mono myth.

198
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,173
Shampoo's burning advantaged with a 
handful of my students slaughtered the 

199
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,010
rest.
Layered blimps smoke.

200
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,883
But

201
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,340
it was me.
I fail cause I was Luke Skywalker chat.

202
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,280
High master

203
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,890
a legend.
Nope.

204
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,250
The legend of Luke Skywalker lives on 
inspiring the galaxy once again and this

205
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:22,620
time as an added bonus.
It's a lie.

206
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,633
Gay Necessity to tear down established 
orders that delineate the division 

207
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:27,900
between good and evil.

208
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,380
It's time for the Jedi to end.
Nope,

209
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,380
not be the last gen I

210
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,743
desire to distance itself from the 
established narrative structure of the 

211
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,110
original trilogy.
Nope.

212
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,570
Strike me down in anger and I'll always 
be with you.

213
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,910
It was striking to me.
Dot.

214
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,370
I will become all powerful than one 
possibly imagined.

215
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,240
Get the jet I pass.
Nope.

216
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,283
Save the books.
It's not that movies can't insert ideas 

217
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:53,734
and then ultimately reject them.
But usually the ideological shift 

218
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,800
happens as the plot pushes our heroes to
reconsider their ideas.

219
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,090
In interesting and thought provoking 
ways.

220
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,153
Instead Luke decides to reaffirm all the
antiquated ideas because he loves his 

221
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,344
sister.
I guess other reversals are equally 

222
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,310
perplexing.
Don't be a hero.

223
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,450
She was protecting the light.
Then she will see me like

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,083
until it's okay to be a hero and by this
point the film has made a 

225
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:27,860
psychologically sophisticated case for 
why ray should team up with Ren.

226
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,060
The old way doesn't work.
Jed Eyes are repressed as hell and we're

227
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,540
stuck playing a galactic game of Nazi 
whac-a-mole fine.

228
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,523
We need a radical change,
which is literally what Ren seems to be 

229
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,244
offering despite her faith in Rennes 
essential goodness and despite Luke's 

230
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:47,660
lesson that the forces beyond good and 
evil ray hesitates.

231
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,883
Here's where ray and ren become opposing
stand ins for the films to potential 

232
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,964
moral codes.
Ran is the realist who knows that the 

233
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,144
rebels will try to impose the same moral
expectations on to ray as they did to 

234
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,674
luke having become well acquainted with 
his bad side and his good and wisely 

235
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,920
calling out the folly of the false 
division.

236
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,090
Ren is arguably closer to finding that 
youngian balance than most.

237
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,430
He seems to be offering to ray exactly 
what Robert Johnson and can say a person

238
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:17,264
should strive for recognition that the 
ego and shadow are both part of a 

239
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:21,794
person.
And what's more that one literally 

240
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:26,090
cannot exist without the other.
Meanwhile,

241
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,880
ray represents the old moral code of 
Star Wars.

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,833
The temptation to run away with her 
swole new crush is ultimately overcome 

243
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,334
by her desire to be the good jetta I a 
morally pure infallible hero who 

244
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,620
definitely isn't suppressing a lifetime 
supply of darkness.

245
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,710
No surgery.
So if you're going to revolutionize star

246
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:46,544
wars,
great.

247
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,430
Want to reframe how we think about the 
central conflict?

248
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,383
Cool.
But spending this time abrasively 

249
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:55,490
subverting everything we love and know 
about star wars.

250
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,010
Just do shrug and revert back to where 
we started.

251
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,420
Nah,
less cool.

252
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,553
But what do you think wise crack is this
latest iteration of star wars 

253
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,830
sacrilegious or a much needed fresh take
on the series.

254
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,020
Let us know what you think in the 
comments and as always,

255
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,260
thanks for watching peace.
Now,

256
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:15,680
while the last jet I had its problems.
So to does my life.

257
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,543
Recently,
my social media account was hacked by a 

258
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:21,050
troll and actual living under a bridge 
troll.

259
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,780
He held my twitter captive unless I 
could answer this.

260
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:27,590
Brain teaser from brilliant.org
supposed to people standing in place are

261
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,320
holding a rope firmly so it doesn't slip
through their hands.

262
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,620
Which of the two people can apply a 
greater force on the rope?

263
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,560
The person was stronger muscles,
the person with greater mass,

264
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,423
or will they both apply equal force?
I was clueless until I checked out 

265
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,830
brilliant.org
website that makes learning math,

266
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,990
science,
and logic fuel like an arcade game.

267
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,660
Personally,
I love their physics of everyday module,

268
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,990
which helped me get the riddle right and
now I have my twitter back.
