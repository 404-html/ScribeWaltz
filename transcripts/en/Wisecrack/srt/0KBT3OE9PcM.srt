1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,270
Yeah,
I don't think it can

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,150
the,
I mean what it,

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,330
the only way to the,
China's got this big problem which is so

4
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:20,514
much of it's a reserves are tied up in 
dollars so that if it were to cut off 

5
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,390
the credit line in dollars,
uh,

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,240
how would it maintain the,
uh,

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,920
exchange rates,
the fixed exchange rate that it has.

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,053
I mean it would only be able to really 
do that if it allows the yuan to 

9
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:46,050
appreciate.
And so it's buying these,

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,830
it's accumulating dollars because they 
sell goods to the US,

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,490
the dollar show up in China.
What do you do with those dollars?

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,790
Well,
you can either buy treasuries with them,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,720
you can hold them in green piles in the 
bank,

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,700
but that's really the same thing.

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,223
You can

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,880
buy goods in the US,
which is what we would like them to do.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,133
And if I,
I mean I think ultimately that's what 

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,113
should happen.
I think ultimately China will decide 

19
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:26,230
they will are a big player in the 
international economy.

20
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,290
They will not be able to maintain the 
fixed exchange rate.

21
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:34,291
They'll have to go to a floating 
exchange rate and they're a dollars that

22
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:39,130
they own will depreciate because you 
won,

23
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:39,964
will appreciate relative to the dollar,
so that in fact some of their nest egg 

24
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:48,880
will be eroded by doing that.
And so they're not anxious to do this.

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,740
They prefer the status quo.
All the talk they have,

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,663
in my opinion about the US doing,
moving this special drawing rights or 

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,390
some other kind of reserve currency 
isn't really what they want.

28
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,463
They like the status quo the way it is 
now and I think they're going to 

29
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:09,800
continue this way,
uh,

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,940
as long as they possibly can,
but ultimately are going to let the.

31
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,910
They're going to have to let the economy
open.

32
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,150
It's just too big and economy.
You can't.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,470
You can't run it without allowing 
capital flows in and out.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,080
I think what's going to ultimately 
happen if,

35
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,943
if the,
if the Chinese economy can be opened so 

36
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:33,094
that currencies are a convertible,
Chinese tourists can take money and go 

37
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,084
see the world.
Chinese businessman can go in and buy 

38
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,880
property in the US and,
and,

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,803
and France and every place.
All of a sudden it's just going to be a 

40
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,563
blossoming global economy.
I think it's going to be good for 

41
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,124
everybody and I think the Chinese are 
going to ultimately drive that because 

42
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,284
they have a lot of money.
Many of them do now and they don't 

43
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:12,661
really have an easy way to spend it.
They don't have an easy way to travel.

44
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,950
We,
when Japan was this big power in,

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,720
in the,
uh,

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,350
in,
in grew so rapidly in the,

47
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,243
in the eighties,
we saw Japanese tourists everywhere for 

48
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,200
the first time.
It was the first thing we saw,

49
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,560
but we don't see this large influx of 
Chinese tourists as what we would expect

50
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,824
to see.
And in New York is one place where you 

51
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:44,080
might expect to see a lot more than a,
it's going to happen.

52
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,250
They travel all over China.
You go to China and you see it's all the

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,980
tourist spots are full of people,
but they're all Chinese tourists because

54
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,330
that's where they go.
That's,

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,313
you know,
they can't really go out of the country 

56
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,694
very easily.
So I think it's going to be a happy day 

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,510
for everybody in China and outside of 
China when,

58
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,403
when this

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,040
orders are opened a little more.
