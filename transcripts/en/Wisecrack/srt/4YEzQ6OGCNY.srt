Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,503
I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.
This week's artifact is the exorcist 

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,550
starring the lady who was in like 10 
minutes of requiem for a dream,

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,790
and the guy who was in like 10 seconds 
of Star Wars,

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,740
episode seven,
the force wakes up.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,750
The film follows female human Chris who 
has a male name and her female daughter,

10
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:40,860
Reagan who has a Republican name.
Chris is an actress even though that has

11
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,050
basically nothing to do with the plot of
the movie.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,050
Her daughter Reagan plays a game of 
spooky monopoly,

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,003
which I guess is the inciting incident,
but the film isn't exactly clear on 

14
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,960
that.
She starts acting like a millennial,

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,853
being irritable,
anything saying swear words and pissing 

16
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:58,854
all over everything.
She sees Chris Shuttles in thousands of 

17
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,184
doctors to test Reagan,
which she can afford because she's a 

18
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,034
famous actress,
but the doctors can't find anything 

19
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,290
physically wrong with her other than her
inability to transverse beyond the third

20
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,124
dimension and affliction that was common
in the Milky Way Galaxy before we 

21
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,814
developed a vaccine one night.
Reagan takes it too far when she does 

22
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,940
the whole don't tell mom the 
babysitter's dead routine.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,450
Deceased was killed and then pushed your
daughter's window.

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,523
So Chris decides it's time to give up on
modern medicine and start having a 

25
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:30,844
little fun with it.
She goes on a romantic stroll with 

26
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:33,934
father charisse across dressing mystic 
to see if he can do that thing from the 

27
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:39,010
title.
Forget about exorcism.

28
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,070
He isn't sure if Reagan is really 
possessed by a demon,

29
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:42,904
so he asks her and she says,
after that all he has to do is 

30
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:51,220
procrastinate for a little while longer 
and then like a crunchwrap supreme,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,460
he's good to go.
Unfortunately,

32
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,294
the bureaucrats at corporate determined 
Charisse is too much of a sexy hothead 

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,583
to perform the ceremony by himself,
so they fly in a ringer named Marin and 

34
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:03,844
bump caris down to first alternate.
The two priests start vigorously 

35
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:10,660
exercising Reagan,
who luckily has been content to just sit

36
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,494
in her bedroom the whole time instead of
making any attempt to leave or cause 

37
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:19,030
havoc or do anything at all.
Demon Reagan responds by giving a gentle

38
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:19,864
razzing,
which causes him to get the vapor so 

39
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,210
marin kicks him out so he can go it 
alone,

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,870
maverick style,
but the real maverick thing to do is die

41
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:30,704
immediately,
which brings charisse back to times 

42
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,860
square one all out of ideas.
He asks the demon to possess him instead

43
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,750
it and

44
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,590
the demon is so damn agreeable.
It just does it with no hesitation.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,140
Then charisse jumps out the window to 
his death.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,840
Seems like it could just float away and 
find someone else.

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,973
I don't really know how demons work.
The exorcist is a contemplation on 

48
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,144
religions place.
In the 20th century of Earth's 

49
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,230
existence.
The film was released during a time when

50
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,064
religious obedience on the decline and 
the 19 seventies sexual revolution was 

51
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,500
on an incline since that provides more 
torque and the opening of the film,

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,363
we meet Father Marin,
uncovering doodads on an ancient burial 

53
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,514
site signifying that spiritual beliefs 
have been buried in favor of modern 

54
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:16,864
fidget spinners.
Chris and Reagan are products of their 

55
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,474
time ignoring religion,
even though it circles around them like 

56
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,620
an annoyingly persistent Hulu.

57
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,910
Do you have any religious beliefs?
No.

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,360
What about your daughter know why

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,350
Chris Casually takes the Lord Son's name
in vain,

60
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,650
daughter on her birthday for Christ and 
besides football.

61
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,484
Obviously the only significance of 
Sunday is that she doesn't have to work 

62
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,263
on a Sunday this year.
Thus when Reagan's problem start to 

63
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:48,834
manifest,
everybody looks to secular explanations 

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,833
such as her absentee father.
You mentioned her father and separation 

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,793
and scientific causes like cte.
The film explores the area between 

66
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:06,720
science and religion,
also known as homeroom father Charisse,

67
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,200
who's religious training was overlaid by
years of med school in Boston,

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,273
well near Boston,
initially considered the idea of 

69
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,670
exorcism to be antiquated.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,020
It just doesn't happen anymore on this.
Since when?

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,850
Since we learned about mental illness,
paranoia,

72
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,743
schizophrenia,
all those things they taught me at 

73
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,170
Harvard.

74
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,003
His experience with his mother's 
dementia predisposes him towards 

75
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:31,610
psychiatric explanations for Reagan's 
Tomfoolery only water.

76
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,683
Furthermore,
the demon pretends to be hurt by tap 

77
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:36,830
water,
tap water,

78
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,843
which reinforces charisse has doubts 
about the demonic properties of 

79
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,500
fluoride.
In contrast to Caris,

80
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,710
the developed Father Marin acts with the
conviction that are racist,

81
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:46,544
grandpa set in his ways.
When Kara starts to explain Reagan's 

82
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,800
case,
Marin stops him because of his extensive

83
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,120
experience with highlander.

84
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,283
I think it might be helpful if I gave 
you some background on the different 

85
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:59,250
personalities were begun as a benefit so
far,

86
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,490
I'd say that seem to be three.
She's convinced that

87
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,380
Harris ultimately accepts the true 
nature of Reagan's possession.

88
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,483
The message being that religion 
maintains its relevance in the modern 

89
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,180
world since both religion and the modern
world are equally absurd.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,713
Through Keris is journey.
The film explores the reason for evils 

91
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,940
existence and area of study called 
theodicy.

92
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,983
The film specifically espouses the 
Iranian model not to be confused with 

93
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,974
the Iranian model or the training model.
St Aaron has believed that to achieve 

94
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,330
moral perfection,
a human must suffer evil and possess the

95
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:38,020
freewill to choose goodness instead,
even though it's boring.

96
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,230
Under this explanation,
Reagan's possession doesn't indicate the

97
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,064
absence of God,
but rather serves as a test of faith to 

98
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,274
those around her,
especially that babysitter she killed 

99
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,460
Father Charisse is alienated from God 
because of his mother's condition and as

100
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,294
burdens as a psychiatrist and the demon 
attacks these pressure points like a 

101
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:03,821
Swedish massage.
Zeus in the end,

102
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,200
Charisse confronts his evil head on by 
performing a Christ like sacrifice,

103
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,960
thus demonstrating is reunification with
God.

104
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,540
Similarly,
when Reagan kisses a preceptor,

105
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,463
she is cured.
The film suggests that the ordeal may 

106
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,164
bring her to faith as well.
It also suggests she is in for a 

107
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:26,201
lifetime of barking up the wrong dick.
Earthling cinema.
