1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,423
The reason why we have a much better 
handle on crime now is because we have 

2
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:13,650
trained the police to be police.
That social workers,

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,490
it's not their job,
not educated.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,720
It's not their job to a degree,
not even role models.

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:20,760
They have to be like Sergeant Joe Friday
out there.

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,594
They won't have time to sit down and 
have a cup of coffee and Nashawn what's 

7
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,634
taking place because we have turned the 
police department into a reactive 

8
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:31,110
agency.
They're not proactive.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,243
So they're racing around going from one 
nine one one call to another nine one 

10
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,024
one call.
Now that's not the kind of policing I 

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,390
like,
but that's just the way it is.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,880
So if the cops are going to be 
responsive,

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,760
they can't always sit down and try to 
figure out who's right,

14
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,580
who's wrong.
So their job is lock everyone up,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,340
take them into the WHO Scow,
the cop shop,

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,570
and the judge.

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,450
Figure it out at arraignment.
Who should it be released?

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,750
Who should be incarcerated,
who should be given bail,

19
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:58,584
who should be remanded to jail?
That's good policing when you have 

20
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,544
limited resource and what the 
recessionary times where in and no 

21
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:10,101
longer any stimulus money to keep cops 
on the payroll with less cops in enables

22
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,214
you to do more.
So I think that's why at this point was 

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:17,880
still able to keep the crime down 
significantly in a time of recession.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,860
But we can only hold out for so much 
time as we have less and less police and

25
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,694
more and more people taking advantage of
the criminal opportunities that are 

26
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,474
before them.

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,420
Absolutely.
The better educated you are,

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,823
it just means you have an opportunity to
become a more well healed criminal 

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,313
command,
white collar criminal with a number two 

30
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,064
pencil and rip off everybody by going to
Wall Street where the banks are too big 

31
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:44,484
to fail and then we bail you out.
So instead of doing triple life without 

32
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,724
parole,
for sticking a gun in somebody's back 

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,380
and Robin on a $25 you'll rob them for 
$25 million.

34
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:53,214
But you know something,
at least you can read the Wall Street 

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:55,951
Journal,
right?

36
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,640
Isn't that an advantage in life now?
In reality,

37
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,474
it's the basic ability to take care of 
yourself and for those that you have 

38
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,334
responsibilities of.
So learning what life is about now 

39
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,800
nowadays the pension is to have you or 
an an academic diploma.

40
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,730
Most people that I've ever met,
including myself,

41
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:18,564
cause I don't have a diploma,
I got kicked out of high school and not 

42
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:23,550
going to qualify for an academic 
diploma.

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,413
They're not going to go on to college.
They're not going to get a bs or 

44
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:27,804
whatever that is or an fact magnet 
coombe loudly cause some of them are 

45
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,980
going to major in having a 44 magnum in 
their hand.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,600
So they need to be taught skills.
It's called technical high school.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,793
It's called in middle school.
Finding out if their adaptability is in 

48
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:49,521
the academic world or it's that their 
thoracic and that they like to work with

49
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,604
their hands and they'd like to learn a 
trade and then giving them the 

50
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:56,160
opportunity to do what it is that they 
decided to do.

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,233
Even charter schools nowadays,
it's not full charter schools is the 

52
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,960
answer.
You know,

53
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:01,794
it's more focused.
It's more disciplined and gives the 

54
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,320
child a better opportunity in the belly 
of the beast.

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,693
It's not one charter school in America 
that's devoted to teaching technical 

56
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,850
skills.

57
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,740
So is everybody going to be a white 
collar workers?

58
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,574
Everybody is going to be a go to Wall 
Street and become a thief and a 

59
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,394
financial institution or a bank.
And then tell us how they should reward 

60
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,530
themselves with a bonus because they 
worked so hard.

61
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,364
Robbing US morning,
noon and night with derivatives and 

62
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,210
subprime mortgages and giving out loans 
to people who have no income,

63
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,590
no jobs,
no credit.

64
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,540
I know that's wrong.
You know that trump,

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,160
but hey,
they're smarter than us.

66
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,050
Got Brighter than us.
They went to Harvard,

67
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,900
they went to Yale and went to the London
School of Economics.

68
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,090
They went to wharton,
the business school.

69
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,460
Ooh,
far tall.

70
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,110
All of them send them to get more lock 
'em up.

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,333
That's right.
Since we're clearing amount of 

72
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,744
terrorists,
I'll kind of nut nate's right and tally 

73
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,804
mine wanting,
but he's,

74
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,550
why don't we put all the white collar 
criminals over there and get Mo..
