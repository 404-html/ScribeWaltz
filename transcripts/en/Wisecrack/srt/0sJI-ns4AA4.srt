1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,540
Talking with them doesn't mean not 
having sanctions on them.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,810
We would continue to have sanctions the 
way we do now.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,500
It's just a question of making progress 
while those sanctions are in place.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
We had sanctions on Iraq for a long 
time.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,350
We didn't make a great deal of progress 
in dismantling the well.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,780
We claim,
or George Bush claim that we didn't make

7
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,540
any progress in dismantling the weapons 
of mass destruction program,

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,240
which was why he claimed we had to go 
back in again.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,373
So sanctions alone don't do much.
When we asked earlier about hard and 

10
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,004
soft power,
I said it's a whole combination of 

11
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,160
things that have to happen 
simultaneously.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,430
Well,
this is an example.
