00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,090
Greetings and welcome to earthlink 
cinema.

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,710
I am your host Garrick's were amyloid.
This week's artifact is Black Swan,

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,330
directed by Darwin Aronofsky and Storing
Natalie Portman Holloway.

5
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,523
The film follows Nina,
a human ballerina who wants to play 

6
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,764
center on the Swan Lakers at tryouts.
The coach tells her she's technically a 

7
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:36,964
master,
but not bubble a common problem among 

8
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:42,280
dancers,
so she takes matters into our own hands,

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,690
matters being the coach's face and books
the Gig by biting her bosses lip,

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,570
which doesn't always work,
but when it does,

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,003
oh yeah.
After receiving a sincere 

12
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:54,064
congratulations from the old guard,
did you suck his Nina is told to watch 

13
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:01,120
lily,
another human woman who's got the thorax

14
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:01,954
of a crab Devlin and the voice of an 
angel fearing she'll always be a birds 

15
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,750
made and never a bird.
Nina gets back knee and stress feathers.

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,943
Lily takes Nina out for a night of 
recreational drugs because that's what 

17
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:16,480
friends do.
Karen,

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,690
they wind up sharing the dance floor and
then a vagina.

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,763
The next day.
Nina shows up late to work and in a 

20
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:26,470
Pepsi twist realizes the lesbos sex 
didn't happen.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,260
Although how did she get home?
Screw it.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,513
Like Disney's Mulan.
Nina starts wondering when her 

23
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:39,160
reflection will show who she is inside 
and dishonors her family.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,953
The big game finally comes and just 
before halftime she gets dropped like a 

25
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:48,910
phone call on a t and t I've already 
asked libby along with all carriers,

26
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:49,744
when the moon exploded,
Lilly decides to put the team on her 

27
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,370
back,
but Nina has other ideas,

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,800
namely stabbing her so she can spin 
around.

29
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,540
A bunch of crowd goes,
Woo.

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,710
The coach goes,
meow,

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,150
and lily goes,
hi.

32
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:01,984
I'm actually not dead.
It turns out Nina's only hallucinated 

33
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:05,284
killing Lilli just like she's been doing
the whole damn movie a consummate 

34
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,820
professional.
Nevertheless,

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,600
she wins the game with just enough time 
to die on a mattress.

36
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,243
Black Swan contemplates the quest for 
perfection and the cost of excellence 

37
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,560
because you think I wake up like this.

38
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,293
I do.
The film is reminiscent of the 1948 

39
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,900
classic,
the red shoes,

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,763
which similarly depicts a ballerina 
who's drive to succeed ultimately leads 

41
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,904
to an early retirement in the film.
Reminds us that beneath a Ballerina's 

42
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:38,710
veneer of perfect poison control is a 
life of struggle and physical therapy.

43
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,040
This idea is encapsulated in Nina's 
ballet Doodad.

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,620
It arrives in pristine condition from 
reebok,

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,633
but Nina immediately rips it up and 
reconstructs it in her own vision of 

46
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,570
perfection because it's her way or the 
intergalactic travel warped way.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,270
The film plays loosely on the themes of 
the ballet.

48
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:57,550
At the heart of the film next to its 
lungs.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,593
Swan Lakers tells the of Odette and 
innocent girl transformed into a 

50
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,824
Caucasian Swan.
Nina's journey reflects the ballets 

51
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
themes of duality.
The use of mirrors throughout the film 

52
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,670
focuses the viewer on Nina's exploration
of who she is and that back thing.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,310
She should really get checked out.
Similarly,

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,950
lily actively functions as a reflection 
of Nina,

55
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,970
albeit a more sexually liberated,
cool girl who just gets it.

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,953
You know,
I watched the wishing impersonalized 

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,730
effortless.
Indeed,

58
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,210
black and white imagery demonstrates the
contrasting psyches of Nina,

59
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,090
like the Chinese philosophy of the Ying 
Yang twins.

60
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,073
In the beginning of the film,
Nina can only don the white swan tights 

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,673
since she hasn't learned how to unlock 
the dark side of her personality and 

62
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,810
it's before Labor Day.
When I look at you,

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,280
all I see is the White Swan.
This reflects Carl Young,

64
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,114
owns observation on the shadow writing.
Everyone carries a shadow and the less 

65
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,390
it is embodied in the individual's 
conscious life,

66
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,283
the blacker and denser it is.
Since Nina's shadow has been repressed 

67
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:03,010
all her life when it finally comes out,
it's sinister and powerful,

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,113
but also fabulous.
Nina's struggled to reel in her 

69
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,954
previously.
Untapped consciousness symbolizes the 

70
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,580
transition from children into grownups.
Seven.

71
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,550
In the beginning,
Nina's mama bear traps are in a state of

72
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,840
innocence.
Notably,

73
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,841
Nina is likely a play on the word Nina,
which means little girl in Espaniol,

74
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,983
which means Spanish in German or bedroom
is an ad for hello kitty and her mother 

75
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:30,220
tucked her into bed every night when 
she's not breaking legs.

76
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,620
Yes,
Queen Beth,

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,513
the old dancer,
pushed out of the company and in front 

78
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,930
of a bus signifies a glimpse into 
womanhood.

79
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,310
When Nina steals or clown makeup,
she's expressing a childlike curiosity.

80
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,130
It isn't until Nina experiences of 
sexual awakening,

81
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,430
if a little molested that she develops 
into a human woman.

82
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,533
Gradually,
Nina's wardrobe changes from white to 

83
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,354
gray,
a reverse gandalf and finally to black 

84
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,600
signifying her loss of innocence because
once you go black,

85
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,823
you never go back to uninspired.

garrick's were void.
Happy birdwatching.

87
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,520
Hey guys,
characters intern.

88
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:14,100

89
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:16,400

90
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,393
Luckily,

94
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,710
passwords.
Dashlane autogenerates,

95
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:32,460

96
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,710

99
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:43,380

103

Girex often says nothing when I do 
something right,

104
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,130
but when I told him I got us on Dash 
Lane,

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,780
he looked me straight in the eye and 
said,

106
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,150
well done Fred.
Until next time,

107
