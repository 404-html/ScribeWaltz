1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,183
I think one of the most famous,
one of the most dangerous in human 

2
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:12,224
impulses is at,
is the idea that you can start from 

3
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:17,960
scratch.
So this is,

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,600
this is an idea that has come up again 
and again in history,

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:21,434
I almost called my book blank is 
beautiful because it seemed to be this 

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,633
recurring idea that was at the root of 
this dream of transformation through 

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,530
disaster transformation,
through shock,

8
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,364
through violence.
And I don't think by any means that the 

9
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:43,070
right or the who are the market 
fundamentalists have,

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,810
are the only ones who think this way.
I think it's the indicator species for a

11
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,740
dangerous ideology,
a,

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,020
it's the year zero mentality of a pol 
pot or the desire for a blankness,

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,690
some cleaning,
the slate of Mal,

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,913
uh,
but you hear it from the Donald 

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,110
Rumsfeld's and the Chinese as well.
This idea that you can create a country,

16
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,020
a model country in somebody else's land.

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,040
It's the same dream of,
of,

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,510
of total power,
total creation.

19
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,530
Um,
it's,

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,270
it's the colonial dream as well.
It's a and M.

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,103
I think we are in denial that this is a 
deep part of our history here in North 

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,970
America,
this dream of starting over,

23
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,804
of rebooting the world.
It's embedded in some of our most 

24
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,584
powerful,
Judeo Christian biblical myths of the 

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,903
great floods and great fires and just a 
gang of us and our friends being saved 

26
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,520
and getting to start over,
you know,

27
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,400
Noah's Ark and the rapture.
I mean,

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,330
we are,
we,

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:47,810
we,
it's,

30
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,810
it's an amazingly seductive idea.
This idea that you can reboot the world,

31
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,780
start from zero.
Um,

32
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,060
it's an amazingly anti human idea and I 
think we need to understand that because

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,090
it can be framed as a really idealistic 
concept,

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,400
right?
We will,

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,540
we want utopia.
That sounds good.

36
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,490
Uh,
and we,

37
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,080
we know how to build it up.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,340
But the problem with this dream is that 
people get in the way,

39
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,500
right?
So then you have to clean the slate.

40
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,334
You have to wipe,
wipe the slate clean because there are 

41
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:18,584
no empty lands.
And that was the violence of 

42
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:22,610
colonialism.
I think it's been the most.

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,240
It is the most powerful,
most dangerous idea.

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,010
It crosses political lines.
It crosses religious lines,

45
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,050
uh,
and it,

46
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,010
it,
it,

47
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,760
it,
it is the ideology that has rationalized

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,490
the great cleansings,
the great genocides,

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,503
um,
and we need to identify it as a 

50
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:44,864
dangerous ideology.
We need to understand it in our history 

51
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:49,730
so that we don't repeat it.
Um,

52
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,580
and you know,
and we need to counter it with something

53
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,370
else.
And in terms of my philosophy,

54
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:56,204
I try try sort of developing a 
philosophy is the opposite of starting 

55
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,620
from scratch,
which is starting from scrap.

56
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,770
Um,
because I think this,

57
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:06,604
this idea that we see that there will be
some moment when we get to start from 

58
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,090
scratch.

59
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,120
We need,
we need to,

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,850
to excise it.
Um,

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,700
there,
there are no empty lands,

62
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,770
there are no blank slates,
there are no clean sheet.

63
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,350
There's always gonna be people there who
disagree with you.

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,750
You're always going to have to start 
from compromise.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,370
Uh,
and um,

66
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,983
you know,
one time I interviewed William Gibson 

67
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,670
who's a wonderful science fiction 
writer,

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,980
or he doesn't only write science 
fiction,

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,963
um,
but I was talking to them about science 

70
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,524
fiction writing and he was,
he was saying that there's sort of two 

71
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,770
different kinds of science fiction 
writers,

72
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,053
the people who believe that the future 
is shiny and the people who know that 

73
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,790
the future is rusty,
right?

74
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,003
Um,
and,

75
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,843
and it's,
it's the shiny science fiction writers 

76
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,130
that you have to worry about.
Um,

77
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,480
and,
and,

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,680
uh,
you know,

79
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:55,570
I,
I think the future is going to be rusty.

80
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,523
I think it's going to be built by 
whoever's around and whatever's left 

81
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,154
behind and it'll be this sort of 
patchwork and we just need to resign 

82
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:04,900
ourselves to that,
that we,

83
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:05,734
you know,
we leave,

84
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,693
we leave big messes behind and um,
and we need to start from scrap and 

85
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,220
stopped dreaming of starting from 
scratch because it's,

86
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,790
it's a very violent idea and it sounds 
wonderful.

87
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,550
But the flip side of it,
of that clean slate idea is the scorched

88
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,384
earth is,
is the scorched earth we're seeing in 

89
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,414
Iraq right?
