Marshall goldsmith,
author,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,050
what got you here won't get you there.
Well,

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,250
I just wrote a story about this and 
Harvard Business Online.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,780
Now I'll give you a few tips on American
Airlines alone.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,770
I have nine point 5 million frequent 
flyer miles.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm the highest level flyer on united.
I've got a gold card on British air,

7
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,411
Yada,
Yada,

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,970
Yada.
I'm like constantly.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,040
Few tips.
Number One,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,980
forget where you've been and be where 
you are.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,053
This is a Buddhist.
One of the worst things you can do when 

12
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:39,120
you travel is focus on what time is it 
in Kentucky?

13
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,580
What time is it where I started?
Who Cares?

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,200
You're not there.
You're here.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,810
Another guideline is force yourself to 
sleep and I find it's very handy.

16
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,880
I wear the little things that put over 
my eyes.

17
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,940
I put the blanket over my head,
go to sleep.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,340
I sleep on airplanes.
By the way,

19
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:57,390
the other one I always use.

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,520
Very bizarre.
Looking on a long flight.

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,620
I was put the blanket over my head when 
I sleep.

22
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,610
What it does is you say,
I speak constantly as a for my job.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,433
Well,
if you fly in an eight hour flight and 

24
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,340
you sleep,
you breathe deeply,

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,730
that dry air hits the back of your 
throat and you get a sore throat.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,033
If you put the blanket over your head,
it holds in your buddy moisture and you 

27
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,560
don't get a sore throat.
And you know what?

28
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:24,030
I found very few people talk to you when
you have the blanket over your head.

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,720
In fact sometimes two people sitting 
next to you leave.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,030
It's all good,
right?

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,910
So you just put the blanket over your 
head,

32
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:36,000
you sleep and then don't drink on the 
airplane.

33
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,310
The only time I drank as if I'm on an 
eight hour flight,

34
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,970
I want to sleep.

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,510
I have one or two glasses of wine before
I go to bed for a long period of time,

36
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,344
but in general don't drink on the 
airplane exercise when you get off the 

37
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,024
plane if you can.
And the other thing is just make peace 

38
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,104
with what is.
And also I eat before I get on the 

39
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,640
plane.
I don't eat on the plate.

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,963
If you get on the plane,
two or three hours gets blown while 

41
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,564
they're slowly bringing food back and 
forth and you have this sort of used 

42
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,330
plate sitting in front of you there for 
a half hour,

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,820
you know,
and the airport's.

44
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,250
Everybody complains about flight number 
one.

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,193
Almost always flown more than me.
How many days have I missed because of 

46
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,434
flying in 30 years one.
So the system works better than people 

47
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,490
like to give it credit for.
I,

48
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,790
I,
I almost always get to where I'm going.

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Right?
So the system actually works.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,770
People complain about the food,
don't eat it,

51
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,890
don't eat the food and always good make 
you didn't cost that much.

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,950
And the one thing that has gotten better
is the food at the airport,

53
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,460
put it.
The airport says 20 times better than it

54
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,920
was.
I flew 30 years ago.

55
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,050
The food was hideous.
Thirty years ago.

56
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,730
You had no choice.
It was overpriced.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,510
Much better today.
So make the best of it.

58
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,220
I think a lot of it is just your 
attitude.

59
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:53,760
Be where you are and make peace.
If you don't want to travel,

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,530
don't travel.
If you're going to travel,

61
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,970
don't whine about it.
Oh,

62
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:57,804
the other thing is,
I have to say I annoyed by very little 

63
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,060
in life.
One thing I do find it even annoys me is

64
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,894
people being rude to flight attendants.
The plane is like or yelling at the 

65
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,144
flight attendant.

66
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,870
It's not the flight attendants fault.
They can't make the plane take off,

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,280
you know,
shut up.

68
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,070
Just sit there and you know,
read a book,

69
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,330
bring a book.
That's another good thing.

70
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,280
Brings something you want to read.
Bring a book,

71
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,440
sit there and make peace.
It is what it is.

72
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,890
You don't have to annoy everyone around.
You just shut up,

73
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,380
right?
Just go with it and if you do that,

74
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,050
it tends to work a lot better.
I went to Africa.

75
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,670
One thing,
it helps me in a very odd way.

76
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,863
In 1984,
I went to Africa with the American Red 

77
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,103
Cross famine relief campaign and I 
watched a lot of people starve to death 

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,230
and I came home.
You know what I said,

79
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,540
don't complain because the airplane's 
late.

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,920
There are people out there starving to 
death.

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,060
Don't complain because the airplanes 
late every,

82
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,650
it sounds kind of trivial,
but every time I get on an airplane,

83
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,410
you know what I think,
who cares?

84
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,830
How serious is this?
I'm not starving to death.

85
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,383
I'm not going to die here.
Why am I wasting my life getting angry 

86
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,760
about this stuff you can't control it.
Make peace with.

87
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,581
Well,
I'll tell you,

88
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,414
there's one way in my field,
it's helped a lot and I've got a good 

89
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,100
friend named cal wick has put together 
this followup system.

90
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,410
A lot of what I do in coaching is 
followup.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,993
They've got some really great electronic
followup systems that people have 

92
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,250
developed up.
Who did you talk to?

93
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,320
What did you learn?
What are you going to do about it?

94
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,390
Are these ongoing sense of reminders and
follow up and it works really,

95
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,210
really well if people do it,
and again,

96
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,480
it's a really positive use of technology
to help people get better.

97
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,841
Well,
I mean,

98
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:52,010
I think new technology is part of life 
and one of the keys for being the leader

99
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:52,844
of the future is technological savvy.
Most of what I learned is it goes back 

100
00:04:55,401 --> 00:05:00,020
to basic Buddhist philosophy of accept 
what is the past is the past.

101
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,550
We can all have these little nostalgic 
Lonnie longings for the past,

102
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,370
but you know what?
It's gone now.

103
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,850
I have a 61 corvette,
which is a beautiful car,

104
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,980
just beautiful white with a red coat,
you know,

105
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,800
very spiffy looking.
Everybody talks about how great the cars

106
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:17,630
were in the past though they weren't.
They were awful.

107
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,090
They broke down all the time.
Their breaks were terrible.

108
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
You can buy a $12,000
car today.

109
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,290
It's far better than any car you could 
have bought the past.

110
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,280
We just have these memories about the 
past as if it were this wonderful time.

111
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,870
Well,
the past people forget.

112
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,703
We used to have things like racism and 
sexism and we had a lot of things in a 

113
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:34,364
password.
Not so wonderful that today they are 

114
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,144
much better now.
Those kinds of things are much better 

115
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:39,614
than they used to be.
So I think the main thing is make peace 

116
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,810
with what is.
And you are where you are.

117
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,360
So you're here now.
So now we have lots of technology,

118
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:51,320
so make peace with lots of technology.
On the other hand,

119
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,154
to me,
what's not an acceptable option is to 

120
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:53,991
say,
well,

121
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:57,110
I don't like that stuff.
That stuff is part of life.

122
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,380
Yeah,
that's fast past.

123
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,010
I was part of life.
You could make peace.

124
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,210
You know,
it's there.

125
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,044
Everybody's using it.
You've got to learn how to use 

126
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,690
technology or else you're just lost.
