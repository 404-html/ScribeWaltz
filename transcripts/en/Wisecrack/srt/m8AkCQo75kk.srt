00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,630
Greetings and welcome to earthlings 
cinema.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,770
I am your host Garrick's wormy Lloyd.
This week's artifact is guardians of the

3
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:20,490
Galaxy Vol,
two starring sexy Labrador retriever,

4
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:24,660
Chris Pratt and directed by a certified 
earthlings cinema Super Fan,

5
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,494
James Gunn.
We open on an unsolicited music video 

6
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,870
for electric.
Light Orchestra is Mr Blue Sky,

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,370
but shortly thereafter the movie begins.
The space of Andrew's are added again.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,293
Only this time they're on autopilot 
because they're rolling in that squeak 

9
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:43,350
well money rocket steals a bunch of car 
batteries from a nearby mitis store,

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,100
so the midas employees launch a full 
scale attack with their drone army.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,400
Fortunately,
at giant hard boiled egg comes along and

12
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,280
saves our heroes without even cracking a
shell.

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,130
The captain of the egg introduces 
himself as Eggo.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,190
Peter quills,
long lost father and a healthy part of a

15
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:03,420
balanced breakfast invites everyone back
to his home planet for some extra syrup,

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,283
but just the humanoid characters,
the freaks have to stay behind in case 

17
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,920
someone shows up to kidnap them,
which thankfully someone does.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,843
It's Yon.
Do a minor bad guy from the first one 

19
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,814
here to confuse everybody by snagging 
the primary emotional arc of the second 

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,380
one,
he captures rocket,

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,243
but almost immediately his crew mutinies
for fear of getting their trash cans 

22
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,430
knocked over,
or the crew doesn't account for his baby

23
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,670
groot coming to the rescue with 
Vaudevillian slapstick.

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,610
Meanwhile,
Eggo reveals that he and his home planet

25
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:33,444
are actually one and the same and that 
he's some kind of godlike celestial 

26
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,900
being a super ego,
if you will.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,913
He explained that he took his Kurt 
Russell form in order to travel the 

28
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,800
universe and find meaning in his life.
I either get laid,

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,813
he does not explain why.
A being who has been around for 

30
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:50,394
Millennia and projects is on appearance,
would bother to age himself up after 

31
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:57,000
only 30 years.
In any case,

32
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,140
echo shows,
Peter,

33
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:58,974
that he has celestial powers to,
such as the power to have a catch and 

34
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:04,794
the power to overanalyze earth media,
one of earth's greatest musical 

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,700
compositions.

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,520
Perhaps it's very greatest.
Yes.

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,580
As if anyone had any interest in that 
unfortunately Eggo,

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,943
then let slip that he planted seeds on 
thousands of planets in order to take 

39
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,084
them over,
but one celestial isn't enough to 

40
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,470
activate them.
He needs to celestial's.

41
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,470
Why not just do it himself and only 
activate half the planets?

42
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,540
You asked?
Shut up.

43
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,403
Peter starts going through his 
rebellious phase and stands up to his 

44
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,240
mean old dad.
Soon.

45
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,250
All the other space avengers join in on 
the fund and rock.

46
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:45,210
It makes a bomb using those batteries 
from the beginning.

47
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,343
Full circle baby.
They burn to a crisp and yon do 

48
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:52,110
sacrifices himself to prove some point 
or another.

49
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,183
Then there's just enough time for the 
movie to set the Guinness Beer record 

50
00:02:55,771 --> 00:03:00,771
for most post credit scene guardians of 
the galaxy volume two as an Ode to daddy

51
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,644
issues and all their various forms,
especially the form that leads to lower 

52
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,880
back tattoos.

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,671
Oh,
of course.

54
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:12,671
I have issues per Dr.
Sigman Floyd,

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,250
the heavyweight champion of 
psychoanalysis.

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,203
The childhood need for a father's 
protection plays a crucial role in 

57
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,600
shaping the human psyche.
Even if the shape of that psyche ends up

58
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,700
being a primitive,
a morphous Blob,

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,833
Peter has spent his whole life yearning 
for the father who abandoned him with 

60
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,720
nothing more than an ab roller at a tub 
of protein powder,

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,470
Gomorrah and nebulous father thanos 
forced them to fight each other,

62
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,280
destroying the family bond as well as 
nebulous skin to metal ratio.

63
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,443
Every time my sister prevailed,
my father would replace a piece of 

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,613
machinery rocket.
Never even had any parents to begin 

65
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,404
with,
which could be why he never learned to 

66
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,450
shave.

67
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,530
I know them.
Scientists.

68
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,070
What made you never gave a rat's ass 
about serious?

69
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,660
My own damn parents who saw me,
faith in the slavery,

70
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,560
a character

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,393
attempt to overcome their respective 
daddy issues by turning into helio 

72
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,350
copter,
parents of their collective child,

73
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,243
baby groot.
We're going to need to have a real 

74
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,890
discussion about your language.
When we meet ego,

75
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,783
he's draped in long lost father tropes 
from the cliche game of catch to having 

76
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,494
a beard,
but we soon learned that Eggos 

77
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,533
motivations are less about fatherhood 
and more about taking over the known 

78
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,464
universe,
which is not how most father showed 

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,060
their love.
Karen's Dad,

80
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,460
this is a radical inflation of 
ethicists,

81
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:35,630
henry the Henry Nader Sedgwick's concept
of ethical egoism,

82
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,643
which states that one ought to act only 
out of self interest in order to 

83
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,214
maximize their own pleasure eggos.
Self absorption is so crest complete 

84
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,910
that all other life pales in comparison.
I told you how all those years ago I had

85
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:54,191
an unceasing impulse to find life,
but what I did not tell you,

86
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,820
this is how when I finally did find it 
was also disappointing.

87
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,040
Hey,
you and me both bow.

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,233
The antithesis to Eggos philosophy is 
altruism didn't realize your motivation 

89
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:06,824
was altruism.
A term invented by French philosopher 

90
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:12,110
Auguste,
the Henry Nader comped that suggests man

91
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,720
has a moral obligation to live for 
others.

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,470
One need look no further than the name 
guardians of the galaxy vol.

93
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:21,200
Two,
to detect this idea as the word guardian

94
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,034
implies a duty to protect others and 
fall to implies a cynical view of the 

95
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,534
movie going.
Public Echo tries to inflate Peter's 

96
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:31,190
pride,
we've heard tell about the man they call

97
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:33,890
star Lord and tempt him with weird 
poetry.

98
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,150
Death will remain a stranger to both of 
us as long as the light burns within the

99
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,760
planet,
but the Guardian's vanquish Eggo instead

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,940
proving once and for all that altruism 
triumphs over selfishness well twice and

101
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,294
for all,
since they pretty much did the same 

102
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:51,020
thing at the end of all,
one for earthlink cinema,

103
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,790
I am groot.
I mean Garrick's formula.

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,090
Goodbye.
If you have the film analysis fuzzies,

105
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,970
check out our friend Lee over at cinema 
winds.

106

107
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,900

to marijuana to the dark knight.
