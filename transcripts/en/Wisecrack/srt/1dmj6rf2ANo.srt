1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,640
I mean,
it depends on who you are,

2
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:10,474
you know,
it's like,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,610
it's also shouldn't be a stressful 
thing,

4
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,570
you know,
it's like,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,960
it could mean that you take your family,
uh,

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,100
instead of,
you know,

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:18,860
to,
uh,

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,693
the price chopper,
you take your family to the farmer's 

9
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,130
market once a week and you do,
you know,

10
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,060
it's a more expensive there.
So you do some,

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,180
some intelligent shopping and you'll 
cook a little bit more at home.

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,440
And uh,
you know,

13
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,940
you,
when you're at the farmers market,

14
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,260
you're asking the farmer,
you know,

15
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:34,200
how is this pork raised and how is,
what,

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,063
what soil did this carrot growing and 
what kind of carrot is at and all of 

17
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,044
that.
And maybe,

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,923
you know,
he has three different kinds of carrots 

19
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,624
that he's growing and,
and you come back the next season and 

20
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:42,954
there's different carrots again.
And so all of this becomes educational 

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,110
and,
and inspiring.

22
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,130
And,
and,

23
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,900
and because of that more delicious.
I mean,

24
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:50,770
I think that's,
you know,

25
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:52,040
that's,
that's one point that's,

26
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,903
that's,
that sometimes gets lost in all this is 

27
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:54,941
that,
you know,

28
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:56,060
as chefs,
you know,

29
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,120
one of the great assets that we have are
these,

30
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,170
these front of house staff.
He's waiters to an end myself to,

31
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:04,780
to,
to tell stories about what we're doing.

32
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:06,220
You know,
where this food is coming from.

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,750
You know,
without the story.

34
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,573
You lead to a lot of that,
this association you were talking about 

35
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:12,551
before,
you know,

36
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,384
it's the story that separates the small 
family farmer and even the midsize 

37
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,440
Pharma from the big food chain because 
all along the food chain,

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,663
you know,
from seed to farmer to trucker to 

39
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:27,700
distributor to marketplace.
Price is the determining factor.

40
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,953
But when you have a story from a small 
family farm about a carat and about the 

41
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:35,160
soil it's growing in and what that 
farmers,

42
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,040
grandfather grew in that same soil.
If you have a quick narrative like that,

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,150
you have something that's so unique and,
and so,

44
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,043
uh,
infectious to people who want this kind 

45
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:50,500
of food and it informs their appetite.
Literally.
