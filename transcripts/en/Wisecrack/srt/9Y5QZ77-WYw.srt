00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,270
Hey wisecrack disembodied.
Jared here,

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,010
grab that potato chip because we're 
talking about the animate phenomenon.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,873
Death note while death note addresses a 
range of philosophical topics spanning 

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:24,740
from property rights to human nature.
One of the most interesting is justice.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,840
What is it and how should it be applied?
Justice is hardly a new topic in media,

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,880
so why is death notes so special?
Well whereas most pop culture gives us a

8
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:39,320
cut and dry idea of justice.
Death note is unique not in what it says

9
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:42,080
about justice but how it goes about 
saying it.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,100
Woken was wise crack condition on the 
philosophy of death note and even though

11
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,410
this show is 10 years old,
spoilers ahead.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,280
Also a quick note about dubs vs subs.
Seems like no matter what we do,

13
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:53,114
we somehow do it wrong,
so we're just going to use the dubs on 

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,140
this one because it's easier for us to 
work with.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,153
Hey,
that's more time for us to read and 

16
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:01,610
write and make more episodes so please 
don't hate us.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,690
Death note follows light your gummy as 
he discovers the death.

18
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,524
Note a notebook that can kill anyone by 
writing their name minute and picturing 

19
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:10,364
their face light.
A model student wants to use the death 

20
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:13,784
note to create a world devoid of crime 
soon after he adopts the public persona 

21
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,880
of Kira,
the god of the new world.

22
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:24,140
He hopes to create of course anonymously
killing huge swaths of criminals,

23
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,260
places him in conflict with various law 
enforcement agencies,

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
a mysterious detective name l and his 
two successors and an m in death note.

25
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:36,260
We see multiple characters exploring 
what is and isn't justice.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,440
Let's just say the word comes up a lot.
I am justice,

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,730
justice,
justice,

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,930
justice,
justice,

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,400
justice,
justice,

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,263
but the cool thing is the show doesn't 
give us a clear stance on what 

31
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:47,804
constitutes justice,
but rather employs a unique method to 

32
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,660
constantly challenge various definitions
of it.

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,703
An element of that method happens in how
individual characters propose their own 

34
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,430
version of justice and first among these
is light himself.

35
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,970
It's hard to get a good sense of who 
liked was prior to the death note.

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,430
Although we have some clues to his moral
compass,

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,310
it must be something wrong with me to 
even consider it.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,030
And his sense of moral obligation,
this world is rotting,

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,800
knows who are making it right,
deserve to die.

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,690
Someone has to do it.
So why not me?

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,780
Kira is an ends justify the means Kinda 
guy.

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,763
Essentially the ends of being a crime 
zapping uber tyrant justify pretty much 

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,993
anything including shamelessly using his
girlfriend to distract the police and 

44
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:30,770
maximize his kill.
Count

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,840
the Berlin and killed my parents.
To me,

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
Kathy hero

47
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,130
and killing people who aren't even 
criminals who get in his way.

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,113
However,
once light renounces ownership with the 

49
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:45,274
notebook,
I here by four fit ownership at this 

50
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:47,704
notebook,
he loses his memories of being Kira and 

51
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:53,530
his personality changes noticeably as 
does his sense of justice.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,280
He goes from being a by any means 
necessary kind of dude to a,

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,770
well,
maybe I shouldn't always be asshole kind

54
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,200
of dude.
This is shown by his refusal to even use

55
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:04,540
misses feelings in order to get 
information.

56
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,403
To me exploiting another person's 
feelings for personal gain is 

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,720
unforgivable and I won't allow myself to
stoop that low.

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
This is a huge change from the guy who 
pretends to love her for years just 

59
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,600
because it was convenient for killing 
people.

60
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,350
Light is even told by me so that she 
doesn't mind being used for his cause.

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,630
I already told you I don't care even if 
all you're doing here with me

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,773
think that would be enough.
But he always goes an extra step out of 

63
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:30,990
the way to break his promises to her.
Here is a bit of a boy,

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,990
but light minus the notebook seems to 
respect me.

65
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,730
So at least enough not to lead her on,

66
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,360
hey,
want to come sleep with me tonight?

67
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,190
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,120
Once he touches the death note again and
regains his memories and powers his Kira

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,050
Persona returns and he moves in with 
Misa almost immediately to get even more

70
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:51,030
bonus killing power.
In other words,

71
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:55,770
treating people well is thrown out the 
window for justice with a capital j.

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,873
There are countless examples of this 
tension between light pre and post 

73
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:02,310
notebook,
although they merge more and more toward

74
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,144
the end of the show.
One of the ways this is portrayed is 

75
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:05,814
through lights,
conversations with himself or he 

76
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:09,990
grapples with moral and practical 
dilemmas.

77
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,420
Does that split personality sound 
familiar?

78
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,283
Well,
Ross process but you were hosting both 

79
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:16,644
death note and Lord of the rings are 
likely to send in some an ancient Greek 

80
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,184
story called the ring of guidelines.
Essentially a guy finds a ring that 

81
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,234
makes him invisible and using this 
anonymity he immediately bangs that 

82
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:32,010
King's wife kills the king and takes 
over whatever spooky Greek magic town he

83
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:32,670
lives in.

84
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,503
We could probably read this as an 
allegory for the perils of Internet 

85
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,220
comment sections,
but I digress.

86
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,353
In Plato's Republic,
this story raises a lot of questions 

87
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:42,654
about the idea of justice.
The character glaucon who was actually 

88
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,524
plato's real life big brother uses the 
fable to argue that justice is just the 

89
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,250
kind of social contract that keeps 
people from hurting each other.

90
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,203
The thought experiment is meant to 
demonstrate that people only really 

91
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,190
value justice for its ability to make 
them look good.

92
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,323
In other words,
it's only natural that someone within 

93
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,603
visibility ring would go around acting 
like an ass hat because people only 

94
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:09,540
value justice or morality when their 
actions can be scrutinized.

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,500
Sound familiar?

96
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,860
Humans will always try to maintain 
appearances when they're in public.

97
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:17,220
That's just how we are,
but this is how they really feel.

98
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,563
Most are too afraid to support me as 
they're worried about what others will 

99
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:23,370
think.
Many would rather deny my existence,

100
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,190
but on the Internet where you can remain
anonymous,

101
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,310
support for Kita is growing.
As

102
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,950
soon as the risk of damaging your 
reputation is gone.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,873
So is all your interest in justice.
Glaucon goes on to say that it doesn't 

104
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,600
matter if you were just or unjust before
putting on the ring.

105
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,980
The power will inevitably lead you to be
a bag of dicks and that's okay.

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,873
I can use the death note all I want and 
I won't be punished according to 

107
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,144
glaucon.
If you can secretly bang the queen and 

108
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:52,700
still keep your reputation,
you will be way happier than someone who

109
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,550
cares about justice and banks.
Zero Queens.

110
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,570
And that's pretty much a light.
The boy Valedictorian who puts on a show

111
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,404
of normal morality even when he takes 
joy in doing stuff that is probably way 

112
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,740
worse than breaking the Royal Bro Code.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,490
I never once felt cursed since I picked 
up the death.

114
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:10,450
No,
in fact,

115
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:14,920
the thought never even crossed my mind.
I'm happier than I've ever been.

116
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,570
Oh,
thanks to this power,

117
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,030
I'm going to create a perfect world.

118
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,410
So why do Glau cons,
musings matter here?

119
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,850
Because one of the key questions death 
note asks is what does justice mean when

120
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:27,684
nobody's looking?
This theme is repeated in light 

121
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:30,784
pseudonymity as Kira in l n ends 
nameless snus and in the anonymity of 

122
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:35,574
the cure supporters later in the show.
And here's where the republic really 

123
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:39,414
comes in handy as a socratic dialogue.
It's far less concerned with offering a 

124
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,300
theory of justice than it is with 
detailing.

125
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:46,134
The process of exploring justice in its 
socrates and his frenemies use 

126
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:50,994
hypothetical scenarios and varying 
definitions to challenge what 

127
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:54,744
constitutes justice.
Death note works in a similar way 

128
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,493
showing the movement and evolution of 
theories of justice between and within 

129
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,054
the characters.
Many of the characters and death note 

130
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,690
Misa lights and Mika me to name a few 
believe that they possess true knowledge

131
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:13,080
of justice and the tension between these
characters and they're skeptics.

132
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,220
Draw out the real meat of the show in 
one of the least subtle scenes,

133
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,530
both El enlight declare in unison,

134
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,380
I am,
I am.

135
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,450
Sentiment is repeated throughout the 
series,

136
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,373
especially in the final episode or light
claims that by reducing violent crime 

137
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:33,280
and ending wars he has become justice 
itself.

138
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,070
Kinda has become law in the world.
We now live.

139
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,610
He's the one who's maintaining order.
I have become justice and hear.

140
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:42,814
Death note establishes itself as a kind 
of modern socratic dialogue using 

141
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:50,770
multiple participants to try and flesh 
out some universal question like what is

142
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:51,604
justice?
I'll the republic from the minute light 

143
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,530
proposes his vision of a new world.
In episode one,

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,393
I want the world to know of my existence
that there's someone out there passing 

145
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,314
righteous judgment on the wicked.
The question of justice is brought into 

146
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,840
play while he does struggle with himself
for a second,

147
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,703
might've passed judgment on others is 
the first real challenger is rebuke 

148
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,233
light sets out his plan to immediately 
kill off the worst criminals while 

149
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,830
letting the lesser ones dial,

150
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,700
and only then the world will start 
moving in the right direction.

151
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,313
It'll be a new world free of injustice 
and populated by people who I've judged 

152
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,660
to be honest,
kind and hard working.

153
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,333
But if you did that,
it would make you the only one bad 

154
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,023
person.

155
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,860
Rebuke is motivated by boredom rather 
than any sense of moral duty,

156
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,723
but he notices the contradiction in 
lights argument beginning the socratic 

157
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,770
dialogue that lasts the rest of the 
show.

158
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,880
There's no need to chronicle every 
moment of this series long philosophical

159
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,190
inquiry,
but there are definitely some highlights

160
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,590
that show us the trajectory of this 
conversation.

161
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,290
I've got a pretty good idea of what your
motivation might be and I can guess what

162
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,180
you hope to achieve.
However,

163
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,880
what you're doing right now is evil.
I'm evil.

164
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,880
I am justice.
If this wasn't clear enough,

165
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,830
this is where they end the episode by 
yelling,

166
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,640
I am justice system.
Make sure we get it and did we get it?

167
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,600
Yup.
Right?

168
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,433
They both think they're justice.
Lights likes to refer to himself as a 

169
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:19,530
martyr,
even if it means sacrificing my own mind

170
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,910
and soul,
it's worth it.

171
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,863
Which is pretty weird considering that 
he spends years trying to make himself 

172
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:25,704
the ruler of the entire world,
but if you subscribe to his Kwassa 

173
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:33,180
utilitarian theory of justice that 
killing criminals and making one person,

174
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,780
God will ensure peace and happiness for 
the greatest number of people,

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
then he is sacrificing herself.

176
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,133
Knowing that becoming the god of the new
world will mean becoming more and more 

177
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:44,394
Kira slowly killing light tiyaga me.
It also means that in exchange for 

178
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,464
cleaning a rotten world,
he would have to contend with a rotten 

179
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,124
self.
Something that he acknowledges he had a 

180
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,540
probably knows that what he's doing is 
evil,

181
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,990
but he'll try it.
Change the world even as a martyr at the

182
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:04,170
cost of his soul.
That's his brand of justice.

183
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,630
So this is lights,
conception of justice.

184
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,840
The world needs a Kira,
and since he was chosen,

185
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,140
he's willing to sacrifice himself in 
order to make that happen.

186
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,920
His idea of justice is an old testament 
style bloodbath.

187
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,790
We're sinners get punished,
and blasphemy is the biggest sin of all.

188
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,390
Did he mention the veritable monsoon of 
biblical imagery in this show?

189
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,890
You know the churchy coral,

190
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,090
ah,
this

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,340
ode to Michelangelo's the creation of 
Adam,

192
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,203
the apples everywhere,
l even washes lights feet since like 

193
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,104
spends most of the show acting is Kira.
The distinction between the two may not 

194
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,290
be terribly important,
but here it seems to represent lights,

195
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,124
ideal version of justice,
that the only true just world is one 

196
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,930
without criminals achieved by whatever 
means necessary.

197
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,003
However else speaking as lind l Taylor 
highlights the contradictions in cure 

198
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:57,914
his reasoning.
If a just world is one without 

199
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:04,440
criminality than the criminal act of 
killing people is also an injustice.

200
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,140
This resembles rebukes rebuttal in 
episode one,

201
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,190
but the differences that rebuke stops at
the suggestion that light might be bad.

202
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,113
While l offers a competing example not 
only as Kira unjust catching Kiera is 

203
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:17,544
itself an act of justice.
The show stops short of telling us what 

204
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,660
Elva leaves justice is in order to 
believe that cure is violating it,

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,060
but that's kind of how socratic 
dialogues work.

206
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,043
Poking holes and raising questions to 
get closer to the truth here imagines 

207
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,370
justice as a grand ideal.
A world without criminals.

208
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,660
L however only talks about justice as a 
reaction to injustice.

209
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,540
A lot of characters believe in lights,
ideal justice,

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,110
but others seem to echo l philosopher 
John Rawls,

211
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:46,944
much like a light and plato argues that 
in order to correct injustices in 

212
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:54,070
society,
we first need to have an idea of what is

213
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,993
roles and Plato disagree on a lot,
but they both support ideal theory that 

214
00:11:58,991 --> 00:11:59,824
when thinking about justice,
we should first try to understand what 

215
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,854
it would look like in a perfect world 
where everyone did exactly the right 

216
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,370
thing.
This is justice under ideal conditions,

217
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,600
which for light and Mika me involve a 
lot of people being dead.

218
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,180
However,
others like philosopher Naomi Zack favor

219
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:18,014
something called injustice theory.
This approach does not rely on a 

220
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,360
preexisting ideal of justice and the 
perfect just society,

221
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,020
but rather centers on identifying 
injustices where they occur.

222
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,033
It's much more practical to point to a 
case of injustice than it is to start 

223
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:37,150
from a broadly applicable definition of 
what is just by this measure.

224
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,700
Only after injustice has been 
identified.

225
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,563
Can Justice be applied to correct it.
The L M N Alphabet soups hunt for Keira 

226
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,093
doesn't seem to be directed by a belief 
in a high in the sky definition of 

227
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,880
justice,
but rather by the recognition that Kiros

228
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:56,110
new world is unjust.
Since we never get a clear sense of what

229
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:56,944
else concept of justice is,
it seems totally plausible that he sees 

230
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:01,054
justice as the response to injustice,
so while light and those similar to him 

231
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:05,974
favor a Rawlsian approach of a world 
created around a perfect justice l is 

232
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,360
more focused on correcting injustices as
they appear,

233
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,900
any definition of the just becomes 
secondary.

234
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,400
The struggle and resulting dialogue 
between these beliefs characterizes much

235
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,350
of the philosophical method in the show.

236
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,333
Although other characters like Metsuda 
complicate the conversation and prevent 

237
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:29,890
it from being a split between just two 
ideas.

238
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,843
That being said,
we should briefly take a second look at 

239
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,540
our cake.
Snuffing Sherlock Holmes,

240
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,690
his code of Justice is a bit more 
ambiguous than lights,

241
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,840
although it's very ambiguity,
plays an important role.

242
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,990
In many cases it appears that l and n as
well as m are most interested in winning

243
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,014
a game of wits.
That game may be a symbolic battle 

244
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,254
between competing moralities or it could
just be a case of some narcissistic 

245
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,990
geniuses obsessed with puzzles.
Any of either case.

246
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:56,824
This lack of any strong convictions 
about a positive meaning of justice 

247
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,933
serves at least one critical purpose.
It means that El frequently plays the 

248
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,134
role of inquisitor,
not so different from socrates in the 

249
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,134
republic.
Another somewhat more surprising 

250
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,564
inquisitor is Matt Suda who raises 
sincere questions about the moral 

251
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,130
judgments of light.
Kira,

252
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,710
the Japanese police l just about 
everyone.

253
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,633
Even at the same time as he is mocked 
for his inability to fall into line 

254
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,180
early in the season,
he responds to El Speech on the childish

255
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,014
morality of Cura by pointing out that 
violent crime in the area has decreased 

256
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,520
since Kira began killing.

257
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,403
Well,
I'm not saying this to support to know 

258
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,263
or to condone the murders,
but in the last few days throughout the 

259
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:39,030
world,
but especially here in Japan,

260
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,290
we've observed the dramatic decrease in 
the number of violent crimes committed.

261
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,240
He makes clear that he does not condone 
cure his vision or actions,

262
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,720
but he's also skeptical of the hard line
taken by l.

263
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,673
Later in the series,
he has an exchange with the other 

264
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:56,960
members of the task force that calls 
into question the very foundation of the

265
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:57,794
squad,
the belief in the inherent evilness of 

266
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,280
Kira.

267
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,310
Do you guys ever think that maybe cure 
isn't completely evil?

268
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,650
What?
What kind of question is that?

269
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:06,484
Matsuda I've been thinking about it and 
part of me just doesn't believe that he 

270
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:13,300
is.
So now you think Kira has justice too?

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,033
I don't really know,
but I think the kid is trying to fight 

272
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:22,240
evil and change the world in his own way
and well the world's become a good place

273
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:24,190
for people who live honest lives.
So

274
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,393
pseudo with all his self doubt is both 
audience surrogate and philosophical 

275
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:33,140
foil to the other characters.
Unlike light who is convinced of his own

276
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:33,974
project,
Lnn who are single mindedly obsessed 

277
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,184
with the task of catching him chief 
economy who is focused on finding the 

278
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,814
true Kira to clear his son's name and 
the rest of the task force who have all 

279
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:44,864
staked their lives and beliefs on the 
justice of ending Kiera once and for 

280
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:48,764
all.
Matt Suda is constantly questioning the 

281
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:52,670
values that are presented to him as 
fact.

282
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,653
Hang on,
am I the only one who sees something 

283
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:55,634
wrong?
He can go around accusing people of 

284
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:57,794
being cute on,
but the fact that he's wearing a mask 

285
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,040
says he's only trying to protect 
himself,

286
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,030
not anyone else.

287
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,973
Matt suit.
His demeanor is very different than the 

288
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:08,830
bravado of Plato's debate club boys.
But he first and foremost recognizes his

289
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,760
own ignorance

290
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,940
is,
I mean no way

291
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,950
crucial for revealing the ignorance of 
those around him.

292
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,050
Even at the end,
as he kills light,

293
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,960
he does so with questions rather than 
answers.

294
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,520
What was it all for the end.
But what about your dad?

295
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,530
What the hell did he die for?
Bye.

296
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,473
Forcing the viewers and other characters
to consider their own opinions of 

297
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:30,134
Justice Metsuda helps organize a jumble 
of competing ideas into a somewhat 

298
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:36,500
intelligible conversation.
Matt Suda,

299
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,363
the modern socrates as 10 years of fan 
forums demonstrate there's no real 

300
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,134
consensus on who best represented 
justice or whether lights new world 

301
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:46,394
justified the means,
but that ambiguity is what makes the 

302
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,740
show so poignant.
Death note isn't addicting,

303
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:52,574
detective procedural,
but it never abandons the original 

304
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:58,940
question of what makes a just world.
And most importantly,

305
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,833
it never gives us an answer.
In episode 30 aptly named Justice Light 

306
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,300
pretty much sums it up.

307
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,720
If kitty gets caught,
then that makes them evil.

308
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,660
But if he wins in rules the world and I 
guess he's justice

309
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,623
by the end of the show,
Kira is defeated and ends brand of 

310
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:14,594
justice seems to prevail,
but it leaves us with a feeling that 

311
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:17,774
things might have been very different if
Kira had survived the warehouse rather 

312
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:25,190
than giving us closure that l n n we're 
innately more Justin,

313
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,083
Kira.
This idea of winner gets all morality 

314
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,390
reveals at the war of competing moral 
codes was kind of a logic game,

315
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,343
not a kind of truth seeking.
You could argue that this makes justice 

316
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:41,030
totally meaningless for the world inside
the show end might be justice,

317
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,923
but for us the viewers,
it's not quite so clear cut in regards 

318
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,360
to the meaning and implications of 
justice.

319
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,283
Death note opens more doors.
It closes in terms of whether or not 

320
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:56,361
socrates or rawls or Zach would find l 
or Kira to be paragons of justice.

321
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,770
The short answer is definitely not.

322
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,800
Although there are some similarities 
that we didn't address in this video,

323
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,730
like themes of tyranny and a focus on 
what it means to be a just city.

324
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,780
The real connection between the justice 
of the Republic and justice in death.

325
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:10,614
Note is not in their definitions but in 
their method and that method 

326
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,024
distinguishes death note as a show that 
does philosophy rather than just 

327
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,330
borrowing it.
Thanks for watching guys piece.

skills of a college freshmen,

easy directions with all the pre

measured ingredients to cook a crazy 
good meal.
