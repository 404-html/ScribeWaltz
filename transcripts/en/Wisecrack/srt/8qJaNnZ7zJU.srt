1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,150
Hey boys cry if you didn't catch my 
science of one punch man video.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,270
My name is Helen and I'm here to up wise
cracks science games.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,930
So thanks to brilliant.org
for sponsoring this video and join us as

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:16,764
we talk about everyone's favorite 
holiday that institutionalizes the 

5
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:21,480
extermination of the core.
The purge,

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,273
the purge is an annual free for all 
crime spree that in theory allow 

7
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,274
citizens to rid their wretched soul was 
a deep seated desires by doing all the 

8
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,284
murdering and pillaging they want for 12
hours without having to worry about the 

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,431
Popo.
Well,

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,264
the government and the purge obviously 
has social cleansing at the top of its 

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,140
agenda.
Fortunately,

12
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:45,141
the citizens aren't killing enough,
so we supplement at all

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,410
to keep things balanced.
The ostensible reason for the holiday is

14
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,290
that if we can be super key for just one
day a year,

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,420
we can behave like model citizens for 
the other 364 but would it work?

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,270
Can venting our anger somehow make us 
less aggressive,

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,790
sharpen your hacksaws and cock your 
glocks kids.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,803
We'll take a look in this special 
wisecrack edition of the psychology of 

19
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,450
the purge,
and as always spoilers ahead.

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,400
The first film opens in a swanky 
suburban utopia somewhere outside of la.

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,970
The media is fired up about purge night 
like it's super bowl Sunday,

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,843
encouraging citizens everywhere to do 
their civic duty and release the beast 

23
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:23,794
when the clock strikes.
Seven American streets will be running 

24
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:30,330
red tonight when people release the 
beast in record numbers of Kelly getting

25
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,420
one last walk in before lockdown.
Yeah.

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,340
After all the experts say humans are 
innately violent creatures,

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,730
pretending to be anything otherwise is 
to deny our true nature.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,993
The purge not only contained societal 
violence to a single evening at the 

29
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,284
countrywide catharsis creates 
psychological stability by letting us 

30
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,660
release the aggression we all have 
inside of us.

31
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,603
So what is Catharsis anyway?
Psychology defines catharsis as the 

32
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:59,710
process of experiencing emotional relief
through the release of pent up feelings,

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,793
especially pity for fear.
The concept comes from the Greek word 

34
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:04,564
for purification or cleansing.
It dates back to the days of Aristotle 

35
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,063
who postulated that watching tragic 
performances couldn't do such intense 

36
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:13,234
feelings of pity or fear that viewers 
would ultimately be cleansed of these 

37
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,284
emotions and his work politics.
Aristotle writes those who were subject 

38
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:25,360
to the emotions of the fitting and fear 
will necessarily be affected in the same

39
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,194
way and so will other men in exact 
proportion to their susceptibility to 

40
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:30,814
such emotions.
I'll experience a certain purge 

41
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:33,994
catharsis and pleasant release.
The new founding fathers had been 

42
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:39,280
feeding this idea to the masses for a 
few years.

43
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:40,114
By the time the first movie opens,
even the otherwise benign sanded family 

44
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,194
is down with the purge,
which isn't exactly surprising 

45
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:47,194
considering James Profits big time from 
selling security systems to his fellow 

46
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:52,480
well-healed suburbanites.
Naturally,

47
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,373
James Repeats this logic to his son 
Charlie saying that grownups have to 

48
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,274
purge some times to get rid of all their
emotional gunk and that it's okay to 

49
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,550
kill people for one night of the year if
it lifts your spirits.

50
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,543
Okay.
I know this is difficult to understand 

51
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,344
that your age,
but tonight allows people a release for 

52
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:11,204
all the hatred and violence and 
aggression that they keep up inside 

53
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:15,100
them.

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,933
The series also is loaded with baptismal
language with people justifying their 

55
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:22,760
actions with words like cleanse our 
souls.

56
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,250
Be Aware of about a thousand years or so
after aristotle made his claim about the

57
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,490
Cathartic benefits of theater.
Send bs thing,

58
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,530
cocaine,
Aficionado,

59
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,383
Sigmund Freud.
Your eyes that were pressing certain 

60
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,030
kinds of negative emotions could lead to
the buildup of phobias,

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,360
the stereo or nervous outbursts.
One possible solution,

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,140
discharging the emotion by doing unto 
others as they have to you.

63
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,270
In other words,
vengeance in there,

64
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,104
1895 book studies on hysteria,
Freud and his psych roadshows of Gloria 

65
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,843
Rhodes.
The reaction of an injured person to a 

66
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,860
trauma has really only a cathartic 
effect if it is expressed in an adequate

67
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,694
reaction like event Brite embroiders 
ideas on Catharsis for the foundation 

68
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,194
for the hydraulic model of anger.
What suggested frustrations lead to 

69
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,154
anger?
Anger leads to the buildup of negative 

70
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,890
emotions and built up negative emotions.

71
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,803
Ultimately lead to an explosion of rage,
one where you might have just one of 

72
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,050
those days.
We might go over off.

73
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,853
The theories that built on this idea 
suggested that we ought to drain our 

74
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,040
anger little by little rather than let 
it all out at once.

75
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,963
In a way,
that idea is at odds with the type of 

76
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,570
catharsis that's encouraged in the 
purge,

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,553
which is more like saving up your 
explosion of hostility rather than a 

78
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,570
steady drain.
But the new founding fathers concept has

79
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,404
support in a theory by a quintet of 
psychologists who published a book 

80
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,124
called the frustration and aggression in
1939 the work postulates the aggression 

81
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,714
is a consequence of frustration and that
aggressive acts lead to a reduction in 

82
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,200
aggressive drive,
which makes it less likely that one will

83
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,700
act like this.
Inequality.

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,480
That sounds like it could have come 
straight from the new founding fathers,

85
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,940
psychologist and author Dorothy Brook 
Roche.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,340
When Pasa cumulates and forms an 
abscess,

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,970
the abscess must be opened and drained.
If this is not done,

88
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,013
the infection spreads.
In the end it may destroy the 

89
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,090
individual.
Just so with feelings,

90
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,983
the badness must come out.
The hurts and fears and anger must be 

91
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,240
released and drain.
Otherwise,

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,890
these two,
they destroyed me.

93
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:21,724
Individual.
This so called Catharsis hypothesis was 

94
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,540
accepted until researchers actually 
started studying it and one of the first

95
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,750
experiments conducted by psychologist 
Robert Howard Hornberger,

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,703
a group of participants were insulted.
Then half of them were told to hammer 

97
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,440
nails for 10 minutes,
a physical manifestation venting.

98
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,603
Afterwards,
they were given the chance to criticize 

99
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:44,590
the person who did assaulted them.
If the Catharsis theory held true,

100
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,613
then pounding the nails would make the 
disgrace participants less aggressive 

101
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,320
toward the insults.
Instead,

102
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,183
the opposite happened.
The ones who'd hammered nails were 

103
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,370
actually more hostile.

104
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,683
Subsequent research turned up mixed for 
the Catharsis hypothesis and according 

105
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:00,524
to our review of the evidence conducted 
by Russell Geen and Michael Conti in 

106
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:03,944
1977 a lot of the studies that had 
indicated that aggressive behavior 

107
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
reduced once tendency for violence had 
methodological issues and when 

108
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,880
replicated the results were the 
opposite.

109
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,953
Canaan.
Quanti ultimately concluded that the 

110
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:21,101
notion of Catharsis had not confirmed.
Psychologist Brad Bushman revisited this

111
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:25,190
idea in 2002 after having someone 
insulted group of participants,

112
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,143
he had them either sit quietly in a 
punching bag with the aim of getting 

113
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,474
physically fit or hit a punching bag 
while thinking about the person who 

114
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:32,894
would insulted them.
Then he gave them a chance to confront 

115
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,714
their and salter,
those who sat quietly were least likely 

116
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,594
to be aggressive,
while those who had thought about the 

117
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,830
person who insulted them with the most 
likely to be aggressive.

118
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,963
The ones who hit the bag without 
thinking about the insult or we're 

119
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,000
somewhere in between.

120
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,013
This suggests that while getting all 
worked up from exercise might have 

121
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,670
increased aggression compared to sitting
quietly,

122
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,923
ruminating while acting out aggressively
was the most likely to amplify anger 

123
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,200
overall.
A contrast to the catharsis hypothesis,

124
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,483
Bushman rights venting to reduce anger 
is like using gasoline to put out a 

125
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:07,070
fire.
It only feeds the flame.

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,100
Okay,
but is there any evidence that Catharsis

127
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,100
is a thing?
Maybe according to gene and Quanti,

128
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,790
there are circumstances where angered 
people do seem to calm down if they have

129
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,740
the chance to retaliate against their 
provoker,

130
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,733
but the context is pretty specific.
The retaliation should be justified and 

131
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,280
the target can't be intimidating.
In other words,

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,233
expressing anger can be temporarily 
calming if you aren't left feeling 

133
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,653
anxious,
guilty or afraid that you were about to 

134
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:31,844
get your ass kicked.
It should also be noted that in the 

135
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:34,504
study cited here,
Bushman's experiments only look to 

136
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:40,130
catharsis over a short window after 
participant had been insulted,

137
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,023
which perhaps leaves open the idea that 
aggressive behavior could be cathartic 

138
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,680
over the long term is longer.

139
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,513
Studies on aggression mostly focused on 
the impact of exposure to violence in 

140
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:51,860
the media,
but that's a whole nother episode.

141
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,120
So if acting out your aggressive urges 
doesn't relieve your emotional angst and

142
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,983
might even make it worse.
What does psychology has a couple of 

143
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:02,090
suggestions.
We strategies like deep breathing,

144
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:06,020
relaxation and cognitive behavioral 
therapy at the top of the list.

145
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,840
Something called primal.
Screaming has also been tested,

146
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,793
but the results were kind of 
inconclusive and when it comes to 

147
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,600
deciding whether to avenge wrongdoing or
let it slide,

148
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,613
it seems that forgiving or forgetting 
might be better ways to free your inner 

149
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,394
demons.
2008 study led by Kevin Carl Smith of 

150
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:22,754
colgate university gives evidence that 
people who have been wronged are less 

151
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,384
likely to keep thinking about someone 
who's offended them if they move on 

152
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:29,894
without punishing them.
And another group of researchers have 

153
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,434
developed a theory that even though 
humans are hardwired to want to 

154
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:36,914
retaliate against an aggressor,
they've evolved to forgive because it's 

155
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:41,600
evolutionarily advantageous.

156
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,493
Well,
getting revenge against someone might 

157
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,290
make it less likely that they'll hurt 
you again.

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,333
We're telling iation also ruins the 
chance to gain something from that 

159
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,650
person later.
Thus according to their hypothesis,

160
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,980
forgiveness involved as a way for us to 
have our cake and eat it too.

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,033
We get over the offense without losing 
the chance to benefit from the 

162
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:01,110
relationship later.
The idea that forgiveness is superior to

163
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:04,010
revenge is reflected in the purge 
through all three of the films,

164
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,560
Mary Sand and chooses not to kill her 
dick bag neighbors despite the fact that

165
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,420
they almost hack her children to death.
Oh,

166
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:11,310
for God's sake,
just do it.

167
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,443
Come on.

168
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,520
We're going to play the rest of this 
night on.

169
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,513
Leo doesn't shoot the drunk driver who 
walked free after killing his kid and 

170
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:24,324
Senator Ron Alexa against often owens 
after he attempts to have her 

171
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,580
assassinated.
Even though doing so would not only have

172
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,414
served him right,
but also would have handed her the 

173
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,320
presidential election,
which she winds up winning anyway.

174
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,393
It appears that the NFFA supporters 
didn't quite get the memo about 

175
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:38,304
forgiveness though as they're already 
wreaking havoc at the end of the last 

176
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,580
film and that bet big supporters are 
reacting violently to this defeat.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,230
They are burning cars,
so does the purge work.

178
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,030
There aren't any studies that let 
people,

179
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,160
you know,
go on a homicidal rage for a day,

180
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,113
so we're going to err on the side of 
caution and saying and everyone purging 

181
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,520
by writing novels worth of anger,
Youtube comments.

182
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,080
It's not helping.
Sorry.

183
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,790
It's too bad because in theory,
this still limping.

184
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,330
Strangers really does seem like a good 
way to blow off steam,

185
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,433
but let's talk about another theory like
what would happen if the earth suddenly 

186
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,450
stopped spinning?
Obviously that would be bad,

187
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,230
but what would happen to the objects on 
the surface when they fly off into space

188
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,064
along the straight line tangent to the 
surface when they fly off along an 

189
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,960
initial tangent before setting into 
orbit,

190
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,823
would they fly along an initial tangent 
before arking back to our humble planet 

191
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,880
or what they skid along earth's surface,
following her sexy curves that you don't

192
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,460
know the answer,
but which she did want to prove me wrong

193
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:34,380
and challenge yourself with new puzzles 
every week.
