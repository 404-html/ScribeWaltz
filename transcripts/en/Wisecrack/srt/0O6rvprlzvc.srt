Hey,
wise crack jared here.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,453
And today we're talking about one of the
funniest and weirdest shows on 

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:12,634
television Atlanta.
What makes Atlanta so thought provoking 

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,323
is that it's simultaneously one of the 
most realistic and one of the most 

6
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:20,404
surreal shows on television.
It's this seemingly contradictory 

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:27,190
combination that makes the show one of 
the most interesting and hilarious shows

8
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,410
on the air.
So welcome to this wise crack edition on

9
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,720
the philosophy of Atlanta spoilers 
ahead.

10
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:35,170
And a lucky if you're watching this 
one's for you buddy.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,770
But first a quick breakdown for the 
uninitiated.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,300
Atlanta has a simple premise earn a 
princeton dropout,

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,143
needs to find a way to make some money.
So it links up with this cousin Alfred 

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,853
Aka Paper Boi and becomes his manager.
All the while he tries to balance his 

15
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:49,794
relationship with the mother of his 
daughter Van and becomes friends with 

16
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,430
Alfred's roommate darious.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,473
But this simple premise is deceiving as 
the show which Creator Donald Glover 

18
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:58,884
described as twin peaks with rappers,
pushes the boundaries of reality to 

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,550
insane links for both comedic and 
dramatic effect.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,840
And it accomplishes this by using both 
surrealism and realism.

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,123
Let's begin by defining our terms.
Realism is any set of restrictions to a 

22
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:18,660
creative work which demand that it 
adhere to the dominant assumptions about

23
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,494
what is and isn't possible.
Realism presents the world with minimal 

24
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,990
interference from the perspective of the
artist.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,160
One of the best examples of contemporary
realism is the work of British filmmaker

26
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,994
Ken Loach.
We'll use this as films to presents the 

27
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,180
gritty reality of British life without 
any sugarcoating his most recent film,

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,043
I,
Daniel Blake tells the story of a man 

29
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,054
struggling to stay financially afloat in
the brutal bureaucracy of the British 

30
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:45,110
welfare state,
and unlike the typical Hollywood tale of

31
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:45,944
overcoming poverty,
Daniel Blake dies alone in a bathroom 

32
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:52,440
stall before receiving justice.
Unlike this harsh realism,

33
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,530
surrealism pushes beyond the limits of 
reality.

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,573
If Ken loach uses the camera to show the
world precisely as it is someone like 

35
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:04,620
David Lynch uses it to create something 
which exceeds our logical expectation.

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,140
Now,
it's also worth noting that most comedic

37
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,900
television is neither realistic nor 
surrealist,

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,260
but simply fiction with no real claim to
authenticity.

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,303
This is why it doesn't matter that the 
Manhattan of Seinfeld is just a 

40
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:21,664
soundstage in Los Angeles or that Kevin 
James could be married to three 

41
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:27,190
different beautiful women into different
CBS shows.

42
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,383
Now that we're clear on the basics,
let's get into the nitty gritty of 

43
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,100
surrealism with the Oji surrealists 
Andre Norton,

44
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,083
who is to surrealism.
What guy theory is to donkey sauce and 

45
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,434
percent.
Robert Barton was a French writer 

46
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:39,724
working in the early 20th century who 
viewed surrealism as both an artistic 

47
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,923
and political tool.
One of the ways in which Proton 

48
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,743
described surrealism is a psychic 
automatism and its bigger state by week 

49
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:54,430
one proposal to express the actual 
functioning of thought.

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,770
Have you haven't had your daily 
microdose of Lsd yet?

51
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,663
Put Burton is saying is that surrealism 
uses art to express what's really going 

52
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,120
on at both the personal and social 
level.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,120
Surrealist art might confuse us at 
first,

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,660
but on the other side of this confusion,
we can see the world in a new light.

55
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,640
So how do you take an art form that 
aspires to exceed reality and combine it

56
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,220
with an art form that takes the exact 
opposite approach.

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,353
While let's find out first on realism.
Atlanta makes a deliberate effort to 

58
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:23,974
portray life in Atlanta accurately,
especially for people struggling like 

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,993
earth.
It removes the fictionalized glamour of 

60
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:34,921
say a rap video and instead gives us the
sometimes not so pleasant reality behind

61
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:35,824
the facade.
Take paper voice apartment while the 

62
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,314
network originally wanted him to live 
somewhere that would fit the stereotype 

63
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,254
of a rapper's house.
The show puts him in a pretty standard 

64
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,224
Atlanta apartment building or someone 
like paper boy would actually live or 

65
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:47,920
redmond

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,920
got my eye and then boys right here,
you know we are in on the floor or watch

67
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,120
tv at the same time,

68
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,023
he also is usually profusely sweating 
because Atlanta is king hot and anyone 

69
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,580
who had portrayed otherwise with makeup 
is a liar.

70
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,950
Meanwhile,
earn lives in a storage unit and works a

71
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:05,784
series of odd jobs while trying to make 
it as a manager when they're in need of 

72
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,144
sustenance.
Paper Boi and dairy is don't just get 

73
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,184
wings from an anonymous restaurant.
They go to Atlanta institution Jr 

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,740
crickets and ordered lemon pepper,
wet wigs,

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,633
a regional staple not available outside 
the six seven eight and 404 area codes 

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,480
major

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,313
and then couple of joints.
These cocktail sauce on snap lemon 

78
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,554
pepper wings.

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,020
This commitment to realism makes the 
city of Atlanta a character in the show.

80
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,170
This stands in stark contrast to 
surrealism.

81
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,183
While it's realism is important,
Atlanta's embrace of surrealism has 

82
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:41,024
produced its most memorable moments,
whether it's been the Tele Sandwich guy 

83
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:44,864
on the bus

84
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,610
symptom,
not the way things necessarily the ship

85
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,900
black student wearing white facing 
class,

86
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,970
a strip club Dj speaking to earn.

87
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,250
You'll just look at it Tipa what are you
going my man,

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,380
I said Chip Hook with that green jacket 
out.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,940
Whack ass cold.
Cool g shirt

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,820
or most things.
Darious does the careful.

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,420
It's very,
very cold.

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,100
Atlanta's world is full of seemingly 
nonsensical characters and events.

93
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,420
Atlanta often blends the surreal and the
real together in the same scene,

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,343
including the one we just discussed 
after being told that the chef hooked 

95
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:35,464
him up.
We see a magical glow coming from the 

96
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:37,894
wings showing the viewers from outside 
Atlanta precisely how magical and 

97
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,124
revered these wings are.
But often the use of surrealism can ask 

98
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,400
us to rethink what we take for granted.
And the season one episode,

99
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,760
nobody beats the biebs paper.
Boys playing a celebrity basketball game

100
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,000
with the son of Justin Timberlake and 
Post Malone Justin Bieber.

101
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,163
Well,
the idea of paper Boi dunking on Bieber 

102
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,064
is perfect enough on its own.
The real twist comes when we see Justin 

103
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,400
Bieber and he's well black.
The deal,

104
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,500
this is a clear subversion of our 
expectation and while this surreal,

105
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,334
this casting might seem confusing,
it creates some wonderful comedic 

106
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,430
moments.
Get a Buddha,

107
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,110
others because Brian's out.
Cool.

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,560
But what's most important is that 
besides being black,

109
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,503
Atlanta,
Justin bieber acts just like the real 

110
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:24,974
justin bieber.
He treats reporters and fans like acts 

111
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,374
like a spoiled Brat has a huge entourage
and can't fathom the idea of anyone 

112
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,220
getting more attention than him.
After acting like an asshole for much of

113
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,680
the episode,
beaver holds a press conference where he

114
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,020
apologizes for his behavior with the new
song

115
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,840
thing that bieber actually did in real 
life.

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,193
Yeah.

117
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,773
This surreal take on beavers very real 
behavior leaves the audience with a 

118
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:11,794
crucial question,
namely what his behavior be perceived 

119
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,060
differently.
If he were black,

120
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,820
black beaver would please Burton as he's
used,

121
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,830
not just for surreal humor.
The forces,

122
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,590
the audience to rethink their 
assumptions about reality.

123
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,723
In this case,
does our culture forgive white 

124
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:27,094
celebrities for bad behavior of while 
holding celebrities of color to a 

125
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:33,610
different standard and even weirder 
example of surrealism takes place in the

126
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:34,444
same episode while paper Boi and earn 
are busy at the celebrity basketball 

127
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:37,954
game,
darious heads is local gun range to let 

128
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:42,190
off some stress,
but his range mates get pissed when they

129
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,560
noticed.
Dairies says target poster isn't a human

130
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,900
outline,
but instead a picture of a dog,

131
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,170
this raises the question,
who would shoot a dog target shoot dogs.

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,780
We're not your second.
But then we're forced to consider,

133
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,070
well,
why would I shoot a human?

134
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,890
I mean that's weird,
right?

135
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:00,724
I mean,
look at that one.

136
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,683
This is way too specific.
It's also a potential nod to white 

137
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,860
people's over the top obsession with 
their dogs,

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
which nobody a wise crack from late to,
nope,

139
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,940
not,
not even a little bit.

140
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,330
I did not know people like dogs this 
month.

141
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,460
I use of realism that is quite literally
hard to see.

142
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,423
Takes place in episode eight of season 
one in which earned darious and paper 

143
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,630
boy are outside the club after strong 
arming the club owner to get paid.

144
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,510
Just getting their money was a surreal 
endeavor in itself,

145
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:28,390
but things get even weirder once they 
hit the parking lot.

146
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,643
In case you don't know what you just saw
that was an invisible car speeding 

147
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,120
through the parking lot,
leaving bodies in its weight.

148
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,313
Is this meant to be a commentary on the 
absurd ways that celebrities use their 

149
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,700
money to flex on everyone else?

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,833
Maybe could it be highlighting the way 
in which we have become so desensitized 

151
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:44,794
to violence that the only way to make it
stand out is to use an invisible car 

152
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,753
possibly.
Or is this Atlanta at its most twin 

153
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,870
peaks,
and we shouldn't look for meaning at all

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,093
either way.
It's a good reminder that surrealism 

155
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,320
doesn't always have to mean something as
often.

156
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,790
It's used to undermine and confuse our 
rational impulse to project meaning onto

157
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,380
everything.
Nice condo.

158
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,513
The flip side of this,
meaningless surrealism can be seen in 

159
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,450
one of the most uncomfortable moments of
season one,

160
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,360
the juneteenth party,
in case you're not up on your history.

161
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,194
Juneteenth is the holiday that 
celebrates the abolition of slavery in 

162
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,194
Texas and in general,
the emancipation of slaves throughout 

163
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,954
the confederacy at the party,
the husband of the host gives earn an 

164
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,000
impromptu lecture on the importance of 
visiting Africa.

165
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,940
That was a pilgrimage needed to pay my 
respects.

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,000
Ask for forgiveness.
One,

167
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,383
you know,
right?

168
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,660
I don't,
I really don't like you.

169
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,740
You've never been to Africa.
No.

170
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,420
You gotta go.
It's your motherland.

171
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,270
What are you thinking

172
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,230
and predicts his ancestors via his 
facial features,

173
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,900
Congo,
Ivory Coast,

174
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,380
southeastern,
ben to region.

175
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,603
I don't know this spooky thing called 
slavery happened and my entire ethnic 

176
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:57,810
identity was her race.

177
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,700
And to ensure that he is the platonic 
form of that white guy.

178
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,430
He let it performs a poem about the 
horrors of slavery.

179
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,850
Jim Crow has the name of a man,
but is it

180
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,920
ghost?
I am a man,

181
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,700
but Jim Crow is haunting me liking that 
movie poltergeist.

182
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,853
That's right.
The only white guy at the party 

183
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,014
celebrating the end of slavery performs 
a poem about slavery from the 

184
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,190
perspective of a black man,

185
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,070
let me slave ships

186
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,840
and to add salt to the rim of this Super
Awkward Margarita.

187
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,430
The parties bar offers fun cocktails 
named after the horrors of slavery.

188
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,400
I have to plantation master poison

189
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,690
and we couldn't talk about surrealism 
and Atlanta without covering the most.

190
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:46,524
Talked about episodes of season one b a 
n the entire episode takes place during 

191
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,384
a fictional talk show where paper boys 
being grilled by a feminist sociologist 

192
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:55,420
for his lyric

193
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,270
rap is tickets coming home to roost.
My life is messed up.

194
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,890
Y'All did?
Okay.

195
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,330
That's black news.
You can look that up.

196
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,160
Well your news is problematic.
This,

197
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:03,994
that ain't my fault.

198
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,460
The crown jewel of this episode is a 
black teenager from Atlanta.

199
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:10,820
That self identifies as a 30 year old 
white man from Denver.

200
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,340
Hey,
excuse me.

201
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,400
What Ipa?
Do you have one tack?

202
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,290
Hey,
did you see game of thrones last night?

203
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,710
This came on the heels of the cultural 
show.

204
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:20,544
That was Rachel Dolezal and the ensuing 
debates about trans racial identity 

205
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,263
while the notion of a white person self 
identifying as black led to genuine 

206
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,194
debate and consideration.
Atlanta asks us to consider how we feel 

207
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,404
about the issue when it's a black teen 
self identifying as a white man and 

208
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,514
paper voice responses.
One that much of the audience likely 

209
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,394
resonates with.

210
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,300
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

211
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,170
This is dumb.
This is dumb

212
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,123
and this might be the ultimate genius of
Atlanta as unlike other shows that have 

213
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,640
used surreal elements to take us further
away from reality.

214
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,653
Atlanta uses surrealism to bring our 
back to reality by using the surreal to 

215
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:56,914
disrupt the habitual way we look at and 
think about certain topics we can 

216
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:01,474
reconsider them altogether.
We see this in Clark County and his 

217
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,770
hybrid music video slash commercial for 
you who uh,

218
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,170
blacks on the base.
Like this seemingly surreal example of a

219
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,004
famous rapper making a song about an 
artificial chocolate beverage exposes 

220
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,340
something that's an actually going on.
I Eve,

221
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,183
much of art produced in our day and age 
is really just thinly veiled 

222
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,840
advertising.
We don't really need

223
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,830
good.

224
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,663
This example resonates with the 
influence of Marxism one Burton as he 

225
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,370
surreal moment leads to a sociopolitical
critique.

226
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,383
This use of surrealism for social 
critique is what keeps Atlanta in the 

227
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,374
spirit of protons work in both seasons.
Surrealism is used to reflect on 

228
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:50,070
everything from inequality to cultural 
appropriation.

229
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,120
Boy,
they before Christie grab go

230
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,143
and it refuses to let the viewer turn 
off their TV without confronting 

231
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:06,504
something real and urgent about society.
This might be the most unique 

232
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,034
contribution Atlanta has made to 
contemporary television in the same way 

233
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,250
that an employee's surrealism without 
veering into absurdity.

234
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,210
It also provides cultural commentary 
without coming off as preachy.

235
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,880
Hi,
I'm Brandon Tartikoff,

236
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:27,380
chairman of NBC entertainment and I've 
got a hit idea for the new fall season.

237
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,900
Don't do drugs.
There's no hope when dope

238
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,903
and it's this commitment to pushing the 
boundaries of surrealism that gives us 

239
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:40,270
one of the most insane moments of 
television in recent memory.

240
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,570
Gotcha.
Okay.

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,833
Before we go,
it's worth mentioning the aims of 

242
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,270
Bhutan,
surrealism in relation to Atlanta,

243
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,540
creator Donald Glover's,
musical alter ego,

244
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,403
childish Gambino as Britain makes clear 
the aim of surrealism is not simply to 

245
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:06,384
create a new form of culture,
it's to use art to change culture can 

246
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,450
revealing its true structure.
The baton,

247
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,313
the world is only very relatively into 
with thought meaning that much of what 

248
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:21,060
we perceive isn't a true indicator of 
the way the world really is.

249
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,283
We can see this in this is America.
We're surreal elements are used to make 

250
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,820
a scaling political critique of the 
State of affairs in Contemporary America

251
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,013
and if this video is any indication it 
seems like glover and his creative 

252
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,434
circle,
we'll be continuing to push the limits 

253
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,960
of a new black surrealism for the 
foreseeable future and as always,

254
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,570
thanks for watching guys.
These that guys,

255
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:46,860
what can also be surreal is finding out 
your computer has been secretly hacked,

256
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,220
which is why most people use Vpn to 
protect their web surfing.

257
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,140
We could have used one back in the early
days of wise crack when we were actually

258
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:58,310
hacked to get back our channel.
We literally had to pay off some hackers

259
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,540
in,
you know,

260
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:03,380
my life could have been like if I had 
kept that bid coin to keep hackers out.

261
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,214
We could have used Nord vpn with 
unlimited bandwidth and double data 

262
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,210
encryption.
You can surf privately and securely from
