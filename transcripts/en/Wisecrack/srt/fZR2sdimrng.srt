1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,120
Hey guys,
Helen again,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,390
so I know we've talked about rick and 
morty have bought,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,433
but well,
jared has been lamenting the lack of 

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,514
meaning in our asshole universe.
I thought it was time to give science a 

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:17,730
chance to shine light on everyone's 
favorite negligent grandpa and his,

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,280
uh,
talented career savvy son in law.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,640
When do we need food?
When we're hungry.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,023
Specifically,
I wanted to see what psychology had to 

9
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,290
say about a problem we've all been 
asking ourselves,

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,920
is rick destined to be miserable because
of his intelligence?

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,920
And if so,
is it better to be a jerry?

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,370
If you asked 19th century author 
Theodore dust way up ski,

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,760
he would probably say no as he famously 
puts it in the idiot.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,773
It is better to be unhappy and know the 
worst than to be happy in a fool's 

15
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,950
paradise.
Dostoevsky statement seems quite apt and

16
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,000
describing the dynamic between Jerry and
rick.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,270
Rick's despondency is driven by his 
knowledge that nothing matters.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,540
While a fool's paradise might as well 
just be Jerry burry,

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,370
Visha Maillian simulation.
Yes.

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,720
You just sold the apples campaign.
Who just sold the apples campaign?

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,200
Pluto or the titanic.
Oh,

22
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,370
look,
it's the line for the bow,

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,140
so it's Dostoevsky,
right?

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,213
We'll break it down in this wise crack 
addition on the psychology of Rick and 

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:19,850
morty and being smart make you miserable
and as always,

26
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:23,300
spoilers ahead for being the smartest 
man in the universe.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,193
Rick,
surprisingly relatable as cocreator Dan 

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,103
harmon puts it.
When you're standing in line at that 

29
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:28,964
bank,
sometimes you always feel like none of 

30
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,150
these people understand what a hurry I'm
in,

31
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,820
how much crap I have to do today,
what I'm up against.

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,580
We've all been rick,
and as much as it sucks to admit,

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,503
a lot of us can also probably identify 
with his self loathing and self 

34
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:42,344
destructive behavior.

35
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,760
Maybe I hate myself.
Maybe I think I deserved to die.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,291
I,
I don't.

37
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,124
I don't know.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,540
Rick is practically omnipotent with the 
power to invent,

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,533
transform,
and destroy his way into getting 

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,540
whatever he wants.
Yet despite all that power,

41
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,580
he's miserable.
On the other hand,

42
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:03,720
there's Jerry who's a little bit dumb 
and a lot of bit discombobulated.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,980
Jerry operates best when he doesn't have
to think too much because when he does,

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,903
he generally makes things worse,
but even when he's down in the deepest 

45
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,684
of dumps,
he doesn't seem to suffer to the same 

46
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,084
degree that rick does.
Jerry may not have street smarts or be 

47
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,504
able to hold down a job,
but he's also not hitting the bottle or 

48
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,220
questioning his place in the universe 
and his barber.

49
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:28,221
Happiness seems low,
so is it better to be a rick or a jerry?

50
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,030
First?
Let's look at Rick.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,073
His inner turmoil leaks out in some 
subtle and not so subtle ways like his 

52
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,870
famous catchphrase 40.
Do you know what?

53
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,490
Oh,
that's just stupid nonsense.

54
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,383
Catchphrase.
It's not nonsense at all in my people's 

55
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,310
tongue.
It means I am in great pain.

56
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,293
Please help me

57
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,260
and obviously that way to real suicide 
attempt in season two,

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,370
but is it because he's smart?
The stereotype of the tortured genius is

59
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:59,204
so deeply into pop culture that we 
should wonder whether it's overblown 

60
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,884
Hollywood bullshit,
the roster of famous folks from history 

61
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,764
who have suffered from crushing 
depression and the attention given to 

62
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,584
the brilliance madness link by the media
almost makes it seem like depression is 

63
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,184
a prerequisite to success,
but there are obviously plenty of 

64
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,490
brilliant people who didn't suffer from 
mental illness or were otherwise normal.

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,500
They just aren't to sensational.
Right?

66
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,500
Listicles about as say,
a guy who fell in love with a pigeon,

67
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,813
so is it true?
Does being a genius or even just pretty 

68
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,280
smart make you destined for misery?
Well,

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,143
maybe one study as 3,700
Mensa members or people who were so 

70
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,434
proud of their Iq scores that they 
joined an organization to brag about it 

71
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,463
if they were currently dealing with 
mental illness more than a third said 

72
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,070
they were depressed.

73
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,640
To put that in context,
that's five times the national average.

74
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,940
If you rounded up 100 Mensa members and 
100 regular people,

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,690
about six to seven of those regular 
people would probably be depressed.

76
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,643
Well,
more than 30 of the MENSA members would 

77
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,743
be a few caveats.
The mensa members were asked to self 

78
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:01,330
report on their own wellbeing here,
of those who reported feeling depressed,

79
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,253
roughly 10 percent didn't have a doctor 
telling them they actually had 

80
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,374
depression.
As anyone who spends way too much time 

81
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,170
googling symptoms knows the art of self 
diagnosis is far from perfect.

82
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,050
Plus are these medicines representative 
of all smart people?

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,090
Probably not.
Still,

84
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,983
there might be a biological basis for 
why highly intelligent people are prone 

85
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:20,644
to depression.
Her pinsky who random mensa study 

86
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,680
asserted the people with Iqs of 130 plus
have hyper brands.

87
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,783
That is,
they can comprehend the world's 

88
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,554
problems,
uncertainties and possibilities more 

89
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,310
easily than people with non-hyper 
brains.

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,030
The whole hyper brain idea was based on 
the work of psychiatrist Dr.

91
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,963
Kasim Years Dubroski,
who noticed his exceptionally smart 

92
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,270
patients had a tendency to overly 
contemplate everything,

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,030
especially the bad stuff.
At times.

94
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:46,864
They also seem to experience deeper 
depression compared to the 

95
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:49,774
intellectually average.
These traits were part of a group of 

96
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,430
characteristics that he called over 
excitability.

97
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,400
He didn't see it as a bad thing.
Instead,

98
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,413
he thought it was predictive of the 
potential for being able to achieve the 

99
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:04,300
most ideal version of oneself.
In 1972,

100
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,840
he wrote one who manifests several forms
of over excitability,

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,120
sees reality in a different,
stronger,

102
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,620
and more excitable manner.
Debraski said that overexcited abilities

103
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,780
come and five flavors,
excessive energy or nervousness,

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,733
deep appreciation for things like art or
music being extremely curious or having 

105
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,980
an active mind,
having a vivid imagination,

106
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,880
and finally extreme and complex 
emotional experiences.

107
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,940
Rick is a textbook example of all of 
these things.

108
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,983
He still slaying aliens on the rig at 70
years old freestyles award winning 

109
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,800
tracks on a whim you gotta to use with 
me.

110
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,240
Okay.
Maybe that's not appreciation,

111
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,270
but still can be just a tiny bit over 
analytical.

112
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053
I can prove it mathematically is capable
of thinking up and inventing entire 

113
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,000
worlds and has seriously complicated 
feelings for his family.

114
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,373
While it hasn't been tested,
some psychologists believe that people 

115
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,780
who think this way are more prone to 
what's called existential depression.

116
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,883
It's exactly what it sounds like.
Feelings of hopelessness that come from 

117
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,840
wondering whether life is ultimately 
meaningless.

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,913
Dr James Webb,
a psychologist who studies gifted kids 

119
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,883
notes the well existential depression 
can happen to anybody following a 

120
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,870
crisis.
It's more likely to happen spontaneously

121
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,450
to people whose intelligence is above 
average.

122
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,583
Rick never comes out and says he's 
crushed beneath the weight of a futile 

123
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,940
existence,
but he certainly comes close.

124
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,803
You know,
smart people get a chance to climb on 

125
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,270
top,
take reality for a ride,

126
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,950
but it'll never stop trying to throw 
you.

127
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,290
Eventually it will.
There's no other way off.

128
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,360
On top of that,
he's bored senseless,

129
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,360
virtually nothing in our own mundane 
world impresses him,

130
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,440
but his intellectual prowess and 
imagination enable him to find temporary

131
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,360
reprieve from boredom by way of his 
portal,

132
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,890
gun aided adventures.
Oh,

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,530
and alcohol.
Contrast this with Jerry.

134
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,663
Jerry possesses none of the traits,
psychologist associated with hyper 

135
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,874
brain,
unless you count getting super stoked 

136
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,530
about rare coins.
There's little r two.

137
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:57,730
D Two is where the George Washington 
should be done.

138
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:58,564
Mobile Games or the titanic,
so does that mean he's inherently 

139
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:03,350
happier,
but before we get there,

140
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,100
real life.
Helen,

141
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,933
here for a second.
I want to take a minute to talk about 

142
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,394
this video spots or better help,
which is an online counseling service 

143
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,930
for those of you who saw our booth 
Burnham video,

144
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,793
you know jared gave him a girl and he 
dug it knowing I like many people might 

145
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,310
be able to benefit from talking to 
someone on a regular basis.

146
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,263
He suggested I give them a try too,
so I did stick around to the end of the 

147
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,730
video to hear more about my experience.
And in the meantime,

148
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,590
go to [inaudible] dot com slash wise,
correct.

149
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,030
One to learn more.
Now,

150
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,710
back to Jerry.
Okay,

151
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,140
so does Jerry's daringness mean he's 
happier news,

152
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,950
but it's complicated.
Well,

153
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:37,784
some studies may suggest that being 
smart makes you more likely to be 

154
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,174
depressed.
Others suggests that intelligence gives 

155
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:46,250
you the ability to unlock a lot of 
amazing doors in life that will make you

156
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:51,251
healthier and sometimes happier.
Specifically money as pretty much all of

157
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,244
the studies on Iq and depression point 
out being smart is associated with 

158
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,860
greater wealth and therefore better 
health.

159
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,103
Oh,
sometimes it gets hard to distinguish 

160
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,004
what causes what?
Among the zillions of criticisms of Iq 

161
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,790
tests is the kids who come from well off
families are more likely to be tested in

162
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,660
the first place.

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,930
That being said,
the relationship between achievement,

164
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:12,764
money,
and intelligence throws a wrench in the 

165
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,210
idea that genius equals misery.
In some studies,

166
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,380
having a higher Iq has actually been 
associated with greater happiness.

167
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,453
One study looked at more than 6,800
people and found that I was positively 

168
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:26,834
correlated with well self reported.
Happiness genius has long been 

169
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:33,740
associated with eccentricities and few 
geniuses,

170
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,520
fictional or otherwise can live up to 
the centricity of Rick Sanchez.

171
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,530
It's safe to say rick has a tendency to 
overwhelm people with his intensity.

172
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,370
Some researchers have said this is a 
hallmark of people with high Iq,

173
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,593
but these eccentricities may freak out.
The normal minded people around them 

174
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,500
leaving our geniuses socially isolated.
Trying to roll with the normies requires

175
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,650
minimizing that intensity which can lead
to a so called crisis of self,

176
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,670
where conformity makes people feel lost 
and confused about who they really are.

177
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,660
One could argue that Rick's in a 
perpetual crisis of self on earth.

178
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,320
He's forever an oddball and while that 
doesn't seem to concern him too much,

179
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,293
it does mean he asked to compromise his 
nature for the sake of his relationship 

180
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,534
with his family,
like when he finally shows up to 

181
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,520
therapy,

182
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,353
I have no doubt that you would be bored 
senseless by therapy the same way on 

183
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,850
board when I brushed my teeth and wipe 
my ass,

184
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,013
because the thing about repairing,
maintaining and cleaning is it's not an 

185
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:29,670
adventure.

186
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,503
Yeah.
Just because jerry isn't an eccentric 

187
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,513
genius,
doesn't mean he doesn't have his own 

188
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:36,960
problems fitting in.
He's seriously lacking in social skills.

189
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,320
Very stop networking.
We're in space survival skills.

190
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,533
I'm not proud to share this,
but the truth is I just kept crawling 

191
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,750
and kept working or skills of any kind.
Really.

192
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,050
He's most successful in a career where 
he doesn't even know what he does.

193
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,083
Our Ya the Galactic Federation taking 
over Earth's best thing that's ever 

194
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,364
happened in his family.
I just got my six promotion this week 

195
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,650
and I still don't know what I do and is 
otherwise so utterly incompetent that he

196
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,900
has to beg his kids for money.
Oh God.

197
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,793
Todd,
please don't just need a few hundred 

198
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:05,550
dollars to get through them on.
I have some interviews coming up.

199
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,350
Something's going to come through.
I can see it.

200
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,213
Ultimately,
as Rick points out after the worldly 

201
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,373
Durley fiasco,
the only reason Jerry's able to get by 

202
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,610
is because everyone feels sorry for him.

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,920
You act like prey,
but you're a predator.

204
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,800
You use pity to lure in your victim how 
you survive.

205
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,930
Rick gets his way by intimidating.
People fall.

206
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,870
Jerry relies on their mercy,
so let's recap.

207
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,950
Some research suggests that the hyper 
brains of highly intelligent people make

208
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,784
them more prone to depression mainly 
because they see the world in a 

209
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,340
different way and are more intense than 
your average homosapien,

210
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,770
which is kind of a turnoff to the 
average joes,

211
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,843
but at the same time,
the fact that they can leverage their 

212
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,394
smarts for high paying jobs that enable 
them to avoid the stresses of poverty 

213
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,680
and afford better healthcare means that 
as a group,

214
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,870
they're more likely to be happier.
Overall.

215
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,153
To our original question,
is it really better to know the worst 

216
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,560
and be unhappy than to be happy in a 
fool's paradise?

217
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,710
To be a rick rather than a jerry 
research says,

218
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,843
well,
that's a subjective asked question and 

219
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,394
frankly,
psychology doesn't have a concrete 

220
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:04,290
answer.

221
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,300
Thanks psychology.
I went to school for you,

222
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,060
but for limited evidence that is out 
there,

223
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:09,894
so just that while you may be less 
likely to suffer from existential 

224
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,910
depression as a jerry,
you're more likely to live a better life

225
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,790
overall as a rick,
but which would you rather be?

226
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,490
Wisecrack.
Drop us a line in the comments below and

227
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,760
thanks for watching.
All right guys,

228
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:24,594
thanks for sitting around.
So this video was sponsored by the 

229
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,590
online counseling service,
better health.

230
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,060
We've talked about them before and they 
wound up sponsoring this video to better

231
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:33,894
help.
Takes an inventory of what you're 

232
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,664
looking for in therapy and then they 
match you with a licensed counselor 

233
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,024
within 24 hours.
I'm a full time journalist who 

234
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:43,290
freelances for companies like wisecrack 
on the side,

235
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,740
so it's really hard for me to commit to 
a set time for therapy every week.

236
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,870
My therapist was extremely patient and 
totally understood my crazy schedule.

237
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,820
Plus she was really accessible and 
responsive.

238
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,180
One of the best parts about it is that 
you don't have to talk to your therapist

239
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:00,220
over video conferencing if you don't 
want to,

240
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,610
or if you just don't have time,
you can reach out to them over the phone

241
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:06,940
or through messaging or through live 
chat and you can get ahold of them while

242
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,160
you were in your garage or your bed or 
wherever,

243
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,000
and it's all completely confidential.
We all know we should make mental health

244
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:13,834
a priority,
but getting over the stigma or just 

245
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,380
finding the time can be super 
challenging.

246
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,290
So if you've been thinking about talking
to a therapist,

247
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,270
consider checking out better health and 
better health.com/wise,

248
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,660
crack one or click the link in the 
description below.

249
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,880
Thanks so much for watching and see you 
next time.
