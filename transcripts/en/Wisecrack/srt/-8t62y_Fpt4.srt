1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,580
I mean,
my criteria for evaluating my music is a

2
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,414
lot different than the criteria that 
other people would use to evaluate my 

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:12,414
music and from my perspective,
I've had a lot of instances where I've 

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,100
ended up making music that's affected me
very deep,

5
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:23,430
emotional level.
That doesn't mean that it always affects

6
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,450
other people emotionally.
