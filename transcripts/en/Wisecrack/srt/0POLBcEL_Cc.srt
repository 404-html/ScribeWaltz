Hello,
now,

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,660
do I think that there will be newspaper 
men and women's?

3
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,830
Yes,
too.

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:15,530
I think that the New York Times will 
survive the Internet.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,710
Absolutely.
Their traffic is unbelievable striking.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,133
Um,
do I think most cities in Israel as 

7
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:24,770
well?
I'm just not sure.

8
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:25,604
They're only hope and their aim.
So says the big man at the top of the 

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,883
boards is to go local.
So even the Los Angeles Times is being 

10
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:38,840
pressured to become a local newspaper in
a larger sense of what local is in La.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,003
So there are very few truly national 
papers left and foreign bureaus are by 

12
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,440
the gear are being cut down.
Um,

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,303
the biggest problem is I understood as I
see that the newspapers face is that 

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,653
websites like google glean off the 
content from a newspaper without the 

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,880
revenue from that content going to the 
newspaper.

16
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:01,250
In other words,
google hat makes revenue from these ads,

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,490
but they get the content for vr 
virtually for free.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,890
Um,
you have a whole generation,

19
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:10,580
my generation and younger who is 
starting to expect print news for free.

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,973
They were up in arms because they were 
being asked to pay $50 a year for the 

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,580
New York Times Tacan,
which I find,

22
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:19,790
again,
absurd that they would be so aghast over

23
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,624
that.
Um,

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,140
you know,
I think newspapers are in trouble.

25
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,780
It's a terrible time to be a reporter.
There's no doubt about that.

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,790
There's less jobs,
there's less demand in,

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,920
uh,
in the American public for international

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,763
news and there's less demand clearly to 
our less desire among people to pay for 

29
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,730
their news.
So now I don't think it's a good time.
