1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,963
The thriller joy has,
has some sort of a connection to just 

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,490
the idea of accomplishing something that
is set out to do and on Wall Street that

3
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,324
happens to be a big trade or a big deal.
It could be creating a beautiful 

4
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:26,990
painting if you're an artist or a,
a lovely ceramic,

5
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:27,680
um,
if,

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,500
if you're,
um,

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,530
that kind of an artist or a sculptor and
on Wall Street,

8
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,364
the,
the measure of sort of accomplishment 

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,770
and achievement aside from the bonus and
the money that is attached to it is,

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,730
is all of those little transactions that
happen along the way.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,753
Um,
and so there's a real connection of I'm 

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,540
talking to a client discussing a 
particular trade or a particular type of

13
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:56,450
transaction that they should do going 
back and forth on meetings,

14
00:00:56,451 --> 00:01:00,230
going back and forth on phone calls,
going back and forth on numbers.

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,390
And then like coming out of that with 
achieving this goal of,

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,243
of closing that deal.
Because there's also a lot of 

17
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,014
competition.
So when one team from one company is 

18
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:16,631
trying to like a Morgan Stanley or 
Goldman Sachs or jp Morgan is talking to

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,430
a corporation,
say a coca cola or an alcove or,

20
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:22,130
or whatever,
everyone's competing.

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,403
Um,
it's not like Goldman is the only 

22
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,070
company talking to say Coca Cola or 
whatever on,

23
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,200
on any given day,
there's,

24
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:32,690
there's a lot of teams and there's a lot
of competition.

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,050
So what comes out of that for people 
involved is,

26
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:37,884
is the idea of having some help 
accomplish the deal and sort of beaten 

27
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,470
out of the competition.
So it's all very,

28
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,830
that's why it's such a very hyper 
competitive environment.

29
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,950
And some people really continue to get a
thrill out of that forever,

30
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,103
um,
or throughout their full careers and 

31
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:53,780
stay for a long time ago up a high chain
and keep going.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,750
And some people didn't.
And I was one of them think that's,

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,993
you know,
also quite empty because you're not 

34
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:00,134
actually creating anything.
You're accomplishing a close of a deal 

35
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:04,574
perhaps what you're not actually 
creating anything real or contributing 

36
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,510
anything real.
Um,

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,440
and there's a real emptiness to that.
So it,

38
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,530
it,
it,

39
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,800
it goes both ways depending on really,
I think the person.
