00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,640
When we talk about language,

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,820
we often dig down to universal
categories like nouns and verbs,

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,910
consonants and vowels,
phrases and sentences.

4
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,450
We end up with these cross
language concepts that
individual languages are built

5
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:32,461
on almost as if the colorful diversity
found in the world's languages is just

6
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,800
icing on the strong unity
of the linguistic cake

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,770
and language is grounded in our way of
thinking and processing information,

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,710
which is itself universal among humans.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,160
So languages and cultures are superficial,

10
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,310
but language and cognition run deep.

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,330
But this isn't the only
way to look at language.

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,770
What if the language we are brought up
to speak actually relates to the way we

13
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:02,500
look at reality from this perspective,

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,210
a language is a particular
way of conceptualizing the
world and has close ties

15
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:08,044
to culture.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,050
In the 1930s Benjamin Lee wharf
talked about language this way.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,910
He argued that different languages
represent different ways of thinking about

18
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,020
the world around us.

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,010
This view has come to be
called linguistic relativity,

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,300
exploring the grammar
of the Hopi language.

21
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:33,301
He concluded that the Hopi have an
entirely different concept of time than

22
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,780
European languages too,

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,170
and that the European concepts of time
and matter are actually conditioned by

24
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,340
language itself.

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,010
One practical consequence
of linguistic relativity,

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,820
direct translation between
languages isn't always possible.

27
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,190
Since hopium English aren't simply
ways of expressing the same thing in

28
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,024
different words.

29
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,080
You can't actually preserve thoughts or
viewpoints when you translate between

30
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:06,160
them
and its strongest expression.

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,600
Linguistic relativity,

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,460
the idea that viewpoint's vary from
language to language relies on linguistic

33
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:17,170
determinism. The idea that language
determines thought. In other words,

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,650
how people think doesn't just
vary depending on their language,

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,000
but is actually grounded in determined
by the specific language of their

36
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:25,834
community.

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,590
Linguistic relativity has been abandoned
and criticized over the decades with

38
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,680
critics aiming to show that perception
and cognition are universal,

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,630
not tied to language and culture,

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,290
but some psychologists and anthropologists
continued to argue that differences

41
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,570
in a language is structure and words may
play a role in determining how we think

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,510
experiments on how speakers of different
languages approach non-linguistic tasks

43
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,370
continue to spark this debate.
