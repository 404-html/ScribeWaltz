1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,730
Rome fell in the year for 76.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,840
The microphone wasn't invented
until the 1870s. That's quite a gap.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,880
And yet we still know how the old Romans
pronounced their Latin. Prove it. Okay.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,000
Catholic school literature
class. My teacher, his father,

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,080
let's call him father f a
fellow language had himself,

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,630
father f has a much fuller
experience bar than me.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,490
Respect it's first thing in the morning
and that schoolrooms sunlight is barely

8
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,670
starting to flip. The activation
switches in my brain language.

9
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,760
The words drift in from across the class.
Consonants.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,390
Italian pronunciation up goes my sensor.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
One kids over there talking
with the father best I can
recall it went like this.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,590
So, um, how do we know what
Latin sounded like? I mean,

13
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:50,610
I always thought Caesar's quote was
Venae [inaudible] but some Latin student

14
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:54,870
told me V's were W's and
sees where Kay's Ha, oh,

15
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,680
come on.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,120
Can you imagine any good Italian
saying where any Wiki Wiki.

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,690
Uh, I'm sitting there. Sure.
This is wrong. Somehow. See,

18
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:07,650
my first linguistic obsession was reading
up on how Latin became the romance

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,210
languages. So why was I
suddenly speechless? Lee
Tongue tied. Well, young self,

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,850
it took me years,
but I'm back to help.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,440
We think we know it's Caesar's Latin
sounded like and that wasn't it.

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,570
We know because well sometimes they
told us quintillion was a smart guy from

23
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,520
Roman Spain who moved to Rome,

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,870
managed to survive the off the wall year
of the four emperors and then founded a

25
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,900
school of rhetoric also.
He hated the letter k,

26
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,660
so k I think shouldn't be
used at all the letters.

27
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:41,940
C keeps it strength before all the vowels.
If he's saying see,

28
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:43,800
always made a k sound,

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,610
that means it didn't have that second
soft pronunciation it does in English or

30
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,444
Italian,

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,230
but that's one grew Marian say so
things could look different when all the

32
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,160
evidence comes in,

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,960
which is exactly what one check linguist
claims about the letter r your Latin

34
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:02,790
textbooks says it's a real,
she argues it's a tap edit.

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,630
We're just going to have to piece
together the evidence ourselves.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,450
Starting with ancient authors
writing in good Latin.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,700
The first clue they give us
is the alphabet, which was
meant to fit Latin sounds.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,000
You hear that English.
So when they wrote words differently,

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,430
like on those unknowns and unknown,

40
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,530
it's a face value hint that they said
them differently, meaning that long, ah,

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,560
which sometimes has this little apex
doesn't sound the same as short up and

42
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:34,740
double consonants don't sound like
single consonants in the hands of Virgil,

43
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,850
the epic poet, that CNC Alphabet
is jammed into a precise structure,

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,050
poetic meter.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,310
From that meter we can figure out which
syllables are long in which are short,

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,290
which helps confirm which valves are long
and which ones are short. So some eyes,

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,820
sorry, eas are longer than other
eas, but go look for short.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,470
He on inscriptions and you'll
find something interesting
or won't find because

49
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,900
it might be representing an a why.
Well,

50
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,901
it makes sense if short he wasn't only
shorter than long e but it also had a

51
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:10,660
different sound, a sound
closer to a uh, kind of,

52
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,160
eh Romans left even more clues when
they marched right into foreign language

53
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,060
territory then got raided by
Germanic tribes, linguistic rates.

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,530
We're all taking words guys, what do
you want oil? Bring me back from wine.

55
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,270
I want a wall.
Yup.

56
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,920
Those are Latin words and bad accents
and they make it look like versus where

57
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:34,450
was at the time something we'd already
be suspicious of from poetry and word

58
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,470
pairs. So yes, good Latin
was spreading the back home.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,930
The Roman rebel was busy turning it bad.

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,220
Good Latin writers notice though and
even included characters speaking the bad

61
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:49,390
Latin, the sediment will goddess,
especially for a good laugh,

62
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,630
but bad Latin can still be good evidence
down in palm pay before the tragedy,

63
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,440
a random guy comes along and is the place
to make sure we'd forever know that he

64
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,100
stopped here with his brother.
He does something vulgar though.

65
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,310
He drops the h in the word here.
Ah,

66
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,630
just a little mistake right
later you find a very dusty,

67
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:15,100
very old book full of cranky corrections
telling you that the word for old is

68
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,791
wet,
too loose,

69
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,791
not wet clothes to say [inaudible]
not [inaudible] and [inaudible] Mata.

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
Not No matter. Come on,
people get it together.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,190
It looks like the pump papers weren't
the only ones dropping their ages.

72
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,310
These mistakes are an interesting
kind of proof. I mean,

73
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,700
you probably wouldn't beg me to stop
dropping my ages and less people were

74
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,170
indeed dropping their ages.

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,180
But what was once linguistic heresy
eventually turned into romance languages?

76
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,480
These all have something to
teach us about Latin. Wait,

77
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,120
how can new languages be
evidence for a dead one?

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,550
We'll take Spanish or Italian a,

79
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,590
it comes from Latin a but it
also comes from short, eh,

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,380
but not long.
He kind of like those inscriptions.

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,480
It's even more evidence for
short versus long. Also see,

82
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,160
not know the letter c,
the romance languages still love it,

83
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,260
but before ease and eyes, it makes
us soft sound except in Sardinian.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,110
So we'll good Italian. Say Vincenti
in Sardinian conquering is bean cafe.

85
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,270
No Romance Palatalization
is another story,

86
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,860
but historical linguistic says these
languages are whispering at us and see,

87
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,820
always sounded like Kay,
but most of us changed their thumbs.

88
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,490
Upping quintillion.
So you see younger self,

89
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,370
all of this is why when Romans
talked about conquering,

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,400
they said when Katee and why Caesar's
phrase was Winnie weedy Wiki.

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,000
Now before you go around in forcing
reconstructed pronunciation on us,

92
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:47,290
getting the pope to speak like a real
Caesar. Think about Latins living history.

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,950
This was, but one part of the
story. Pretty amazing one though.

94
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,530
Stick around and subscribe for language.
