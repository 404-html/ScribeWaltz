1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,890
This is clearly a bus,
right?

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,100
No, no, not even close.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,460
This is obviously a Greek people carrier
and if you want to get around recent

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,751
one of these,

5
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:28,751
better busts out your
electronic calculator and look
up the road knowledgey in a

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,080
quest machine.
But if that doesn't have your leg,

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,330
what would stick around?
And let's take a look at the weird,

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,201
the crazy.

9
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:44,201
And there's sometimes hilarious words
that tongues have for talking about new

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,220
tech knowledge

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,390
throughout India.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,320
It's incredibly common for technical
terms to come from Sanskrit, not English.

13
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,100
In Sanskrit, you can learn all
about the principles of things,

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,030
the principles of chemistry,
the principles of prosperity,

15
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,560
even the principals of
pleasure. Uh, hello.

16
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:17,290
Where was that one in my
university's course catalog.

17
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,440
Never one to give into the barbarians.
China has crafted some nifty tech terms.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,150
Take the two characters in mobile phone.
They stand for hand machine.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,930
Clever enough. But check
out this word. Sure.

20
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,880
It's sounds like hacker,

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,290
but it cleverly slides past
copyright infringement. Hey,

22
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,500
we didn't steal it.
That's just our word for dark visitor.

23
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,970
If you come down with a fever
while speaking Swahili in Kenya,

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,700
you'll be a person sick
when you visit the doctor,

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,220
but let's hope you don't get diagnosed
with problem of kidney because then

26
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,290
they're probably going to have to shred or

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,413
Blake,
you

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,870
GE has made an art of ditching foreign
words and creating new Turkish ones since

29
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,630
the end of the Ottoman days.
Before you get too cozy.

30
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:07,730
Here we're talking about the
heyday of this kind of Ottoman,

31
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,350
not this kind of Ottoman.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,580
For anyone out there who's to life goals
happen to be getting into space and

33
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,030
competing in the Turkish language
Olympiad. Yes, that's a thing.

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,890
Here's one stone for you to birds
practice Turkish in a space vehicle.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Totally makes sense,
right?

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,410
You'll then join the elite
group of spacemen era,

37
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,610
but you can't be totally averse to sharing
the experience with other languages

38
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:35,870
because you're going to need things like
rockets and computer algorithms to get

39
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:39,620
the,
speaking of computers in France and Spain,

40
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:43,820
it's an ordinator or is that or did nay

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,460
total or

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,020
I bet you wish your comp had a
name that powerful nearby Italy.

43
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:54,730
On the other hand has no problem just
using a computer, but to be honest,

44
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:57,520
not everyone in Italy is so
happy to take on new words.

45
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,090
The Vatican has good terms
for everything from audio,

46
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:06,091
visual fables to nocturnal
taverns to my personal favorite,

47
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,420
super spacious airships boom.
There it is.

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,550
A Latin jumbo jet,
you know,

49
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,360
I bet some Roman emperor has really wish
they had one of those collegial out.

50
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,220
We're looking at you. She's
just what history meet it,
right? Or Romans Soul plane.

51
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,260
If Latin jumbo jets can't convince you
that dead languages don't stay dead,

52
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,680
then check out Icelandic.
We're old resurrected words.

53
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,320
Dig themselves right out of
their Zombie Viking graves.

54
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah, it's cool that the old word
for line came in handy again,

55
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,260
but nothing beats booting
up your Icelandic number,

56
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,170
prophetess weighted go Iceland.

57
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,460
You're such a make believe land as if
we didn't already have proof of that in

58
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:56,100
the form of Bjork and Sigur Ros
cross the pond in the ink and Andy's,

59
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,930
you can take a class on the
world order in the native tongue.

60
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,260
In fact since patch already
means time or space,

61
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,650
why not dig into the
relations of world things?

62
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,330
Sorry you and this guy probably know that
better. It's the theory of relativity.

63
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,720
Got Your fill of physics.
Don't leave the new world just yet.

64
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,070
First drive north in your black
foot starts to run without a parent.

65
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,470
Cause if that's not fast enough,

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,210
the Koyukon of Alaska might suggest and
it rises of its own accord to get you

67
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,690
there a little faster.
If you don't have a term for it,

68
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,460
just make the word look.

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Native Hawaii has this down Pat Hawaii
dicing words and phrases like I know Kia

70
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,400
gives a Halloween imports and authentic
look and feel and that gets us a come at

71
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:44,920
pula, assuming you don't want to go full
on native and call it in the electronic

72
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,960
brain. That is so cool. Getting
terms to sound and look more native,

73
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,400
even if they're totally not is everyday
business in Japanese with the locals can

74
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,030
box in for an examples by writing
them in a totally different script.

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,440
So hairdryers are hairdryers and roller
coasters are roller coasters in Japan.

76
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,680
Even if they don't look like it at first.
Yeah.

77
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,710
So see that and that and
that and that and that.

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,510
Yeah, they're all from
English. Oh, yeah. Hey,

79
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,690
there's one more piece of technology
I wanted to share with you guys.

80
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,920
It's called the subscribe button,
and if you just,

81
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,510
you and I can stick around for more
technology awesomeness in the future.

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,770
I promise not to do the robot ever
again. Just click it. Go ahead.

83
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,020
Yeah.
