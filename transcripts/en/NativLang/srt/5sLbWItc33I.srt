1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,240
We are here again and the
beautiful youtube space,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,410
New York in a studio filled with
lights and camera and now some action.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,010
This particular action is going to be
talking about how computers can help

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,630
countries get along a little better.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,250
Today we're going to talk about machine
translation and how it doesn't go so

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:21,750
well in the early days. Uh, the 80s,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,150
well known for great fashion sense,

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,740
but guys with cheesy Russian accents
and fears of nuclear annihilation.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,840
Maybe it's the coder and me,

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,590
but I have actually always wondered if
the Cold War would have been a bit, well,

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,480
you know, warmer if computers could
have helped us understand each other.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,970
It turns out we tried just that.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,340
Welcome to comp Tom.

14
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:52,090
The only show on the internets where
there's something colder than a Russian

15
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:52,924
winter.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,470
Let me take you back in time to
lovely 1948 computers were a thing,

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,490
uh,
a new thing,

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,380
a big room sized thing that you've
had a feed with little tiny paper,

19
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:06,220
punched holes.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,170
These binary loving behemoth were so
successful that folks actually started

21
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,730
wondering if there was any problem they
couldn't solve and what are those folks

22
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:17,500
that definitely couldn't
ignore their power.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,640
Was Mr. Warren Weaver the
mighty power of the computer.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,060
He kept bugging all of his
colleagues. Hey guys, you know what?

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,950
You know what computers should be doing,
guys.

26
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:30,820
Guys buy my idea about computers in
Russian. And they were like, dude weaver,

27
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,380
we have told you a million times.

28
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,550
You need to stop bothering us and just
write the stupid Russian thing down.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,290
He sat down and he wrote the very first
memo on computer translation and it

30
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,610
really got the ball rolling.

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,180
First Ucla in Georgetown got on board
and then MIT followed in 1951 by giving

32
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,960
you a whole shoe, a bar, Hillel,

33
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:53,560
the position of full time professional
machine translation, Matt,

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,780
the first and the business.
Then in 1954 IBM in Georgetown stage,

35
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,390
the first public demo
of machine translation,

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,650
49 whole Russian sentences.
The crowd went wild.

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,380
Empty was the next big thing.

38
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,920
So how did they do it?
Well,

39
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,130
they started with the Russian sentence
and they broke it into its dictionary

40
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:18,430
chunks, you know, word and word
pieces like suffixes and roots.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,840
Then they applied one of just six
rules to the chunks. For example,

42
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:27,700
here's the first rule. No,
no wait, we are programmers.

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,900
We count from zero.

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,020
So this is the zero with rule oh word
was associated with the code one 10 and

45
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,950
that code told the machine to go back and
look at the last full word and when it

46
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,940
found that last word,

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,350
it had a check that word for another
code 21 and if that word came up,

48
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:47,530
20 ones, the machine placed
it after the first word.

49
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,320
Now I know that sounds like
a whole bunch of steps,

50
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,970
but the result was pretty simple.

51
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,180
You take two words and you switch them
with only a fist full of rules like this.

52
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,980
The machine translated amazing sentences,

53
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:04,570
like magnitude of angle is determined by
the relation of length of arc to radius

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,420
and the price of potatoes
is termed by the demand.

55
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,740
Potatoes really machine,
culturally sensitive,

56
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:16,180
much in spite of that, the journalists
were impressed and the public,

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,440
they were stunned in a world that had
never seen computer smarts like this.

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,930
This was magic. But, uh,

59
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,020
if you peek behind that
curtain a little bit,

60
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,780
things start to feel a
tiny bit less magical.

61
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,210
The sentences had all
been carefully selected.

62
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,050
Everything was transliterated from
cyrillic into the Latin alphabet and

63
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:38,800
grammatically sentences included only
third person verbs and avoided any

64
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,180
negations are questions,

65
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,220
sometimes things that we would think of
as grammar or syntax restored as part of

66
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:49,450
the dictionary entries. And that
last one is actually pretty cheap.

67
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,643
Think about it.

68
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,940
This machine associates each Russian
word with up to two dictionary entries.

69
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,090
So there's a word that
translates to relation,

70
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,600
but if you look at the second
English choice, it's the relation.

71
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,110
Instead of figuring out a way to train
the computer to understand English

72
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,580
articles, they just shoved the word the
end as part of another dictionary choice.

73
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,030
So yeah,
they were doing a little bit of cheating,

74
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,710
but a only cheated a little bit,
but it did not matter to the public.

75
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,450
People were really excited and if you
weren't translating machine the times

76
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:27,310
we're good for now because when
we returned to wrap up this story,

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,560
things start to get ugly.

78
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,920
The nerds are going to be fighting over
how computers should be translating,

79
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:36,610
and the Public Starts Making a mockery
of grammar and the very existence of

80
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:41,230
machine translation will
hang in the balance. Chai.
