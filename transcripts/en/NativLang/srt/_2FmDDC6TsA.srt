1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,640
The last lesson introduced
the concept of arguments.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,750
This time around we're
going to distinguish now
noun roles from down cases.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,970
If you're not clear on down cases,

4
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,630
take a look at the lesson on nouns in
the introduction to the grammar of words.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,700
Let's go back to the example I gave
it to him from the last lesson.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,460
The verb give takes a giver.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,620
A given that is something that is given
and to give [inaudible] someone who's

8
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:38,730
the recipient of what is given.
We end up with three roles,

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,410
almost like performances that
those nouns play more specifically,

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,270
they're themed or thematic roles.
Those thematic roles are giver,

11
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:49,350
given and Givi.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,180
Those three roles become available
because we opted to use the verb give,

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,720
so the verb give dictates three roles.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,870
Other verbs have roles to see,

15
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:04,380
has a seer and a scene and
make has a maker and a maid.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,410
Now let's extend this paradigm further.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,660
There's a similarity between the giver
of give and the seer of c and the maker

18
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,290
of make.
Those subjects are all agents.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,920
They're all doing something,
so we call that the agent role.

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,370
There's a more passive role.
That's being played by the thing,

21
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,770
given the person scene and the thing made.

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Those passive roles are the thematic role
of patient compare intransitive verbs

23
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:37,290
like ice sleep, you walk,
she ran or you fell.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,140
There's another similarity,

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,500
but conventionally we think of those
roles as distinct from the agent of Mader

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,630
gave.
These people are experiencing a state,

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,420
we'll call this role the experiencer.

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,140
We might ask what's the
point of all these roles?

29
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,870
Why not stick with Noun cases after all?

30
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:02,400
It seems like we could explain the grammar
of I slept by saying that sleep has

31
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:07,110
one subject in the nominative case,
so I say I slept and not me slept.

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,150
The subject of see looks like it's in
the same case while the object is in the

33
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,140
accusative case,

34
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,060
so can't we stick with our concept of
nominative case nouns versus accusative

35
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:22,020
case nouns as we'll see in
the next lesson on alignment,

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,360
that distinction isn't quite so clear,
nor is it universal among languages.

37
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,730
We can use this concept of roles to
figure out how verbs work with their

38
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,190
arguments.
For now,

39
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:40,191
let's set cases side by saying that case
nouns are qualified to fill thematic

40
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,690
roles.
For example,

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,520
English nouns that filled the role of
patient are in the accusative or object

42
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:52,410
case, but not every noun that's in the
accusative fills the role of patient

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,560
grammatically.
They're two different things

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,180
that will suffice for preliminary
distinction between cases enrolls.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,190
Join me next time to build on these two
as we turn to the topic of alignment.
