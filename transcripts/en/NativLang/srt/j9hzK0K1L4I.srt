00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,690
You guys love reliving the invention of
the Greek and Roman alphabets like it's

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:08,370
some climax in the history of writing,
but real language nerds drool over Korean.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,510
And here's why.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,560
Another time, another king,
this time in a Korean palace,

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,150
he presents himself as king. Say, Joan,
as you get a grip on your surroundings,

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,670
you began to tell him of your journeys.
Yet with a sweeping gaze,

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,010
the king books right past you,
you've been out for a very long time.

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,730
Over a thousand years,
the world has come so far,

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,710
and the scripts you once knew have to,

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,000
he reminds you of the old Chinese local
graphs and sound meaning combinations.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,410
Those are still useful to his
court to appoint. You See,

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Chinese has these nice word units,
one after another,

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,420
but Korean he boasts has these elegantly
complex words with different pieces and

14
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:00,740
endings. Fitting Chinese writing
to Korean grammar hasn't been easy.

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,630
He tells you other people across the sea
who've gone through a similar struggle.

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,440
The Japanese simplified Chinese
characters by turning them into a fixed

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,950
syllabary, which they now use
alongside the Chinese characters.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,150
So they have these syllable characters
and these thousands of Han characters,

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,180
they use the Han characters for
the meaning heavy components.

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,500
They'll tabulary terms.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,550
Then they use the syllabary
to write little grammatical
words and word pieces or

22
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:29,720
new vocabulary words that
don't historically have
their own Chinese logo graph.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,810
Such a complicated system,
gentlemen,

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,460
the king has an almost puzzle book
like he's holding back a punchline.

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,320
He recounts how an Old Japan women wrote
entire books using only the syllable

26
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:45,800
characters because writing with the
traditional Han characters was seen as the

27
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:49,220
masculine thing to do,
but he knows of another land.

28
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,420
He's heard exotic tales of the West where
people write out all of their sounds.

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,650
Logically, he pauses, he can't
quite grasp this himself.

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,670
You snicker as you think back on how you
saw the alphabet develop with your own

31
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,920
eyes and your journeys,
you would know.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,120
So you sit down and show him how to
write every vowel and consonant with the

33
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:11,570
alphabet, a couple of dozen shapes
and you can write any sound.

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,970
You smile and think so simple, but
he lets out an unimpressed. Sy,

35
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,980
why do all the characters look so
different? So haphazard? I mean,

36
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,940
you make fun and VA by putting your
bottom lip against your top teeth.

37
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,290
The only difference is that your throat
vibrates. When you say VA, he quizzes you.

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,850
Why do you write fuck and VA?
And he goes on interrogating you.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,440
What about why does it look that way
when it's just taking the VUS sound and

40
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,160
seeing it through smacked lips
seems you underestimated the king.

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,080
He doesn't want any old alphabet.

42
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,310
He wants a writing system that shows
the various features of sounds that the

43
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:53,450
sound is made in your throat against your
teeth, made with your lips and so on.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
He puts his brightest scholars to work,

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,760
giving them the humble name of the
hall of worthies in go the experts and

46
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:04,870
outcomes and other major moments
in the history of writing.

47
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,560
They develop Korean Hungle,
a featural alphabet.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,270
Every syllable gets separated out into
its own block. The syllables, consonants,

49
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,790
and vowels will be written
side by side within that block.

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,690
Each consonant and vowel letter inside
that block will be shaped according to

51
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,410
its features. So here are the consonants
that get pronounced with the lips.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,970
See the similar lip shape.
Here's God, and here's cut.

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,000
Again,
similar sounds similar shape.

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,170
The featural alphabet was so
simple and straight forward.

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,710
One of the king's historians almost dared
people to learn it. If you're smart,

56
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,300
you can learn it in one morning. If
you're a fool, it'll take you 10 days.

57
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,180
Not everyone's jumping on the Hungle.

58
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,100
Easy train community accessible writing
bothers traditionalist who skip out on

59
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,350
the innovation and keep
using Chinese characters,

60
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,140
fit it to Korean Honjo or hand characters,

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,060
even into the 19 hundreds still for
the rest. Writing is easier than ever.

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,100
It has its first rock star. It even
gets its own holiday. Oh, writing.

63
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,760
You've come a long,
long way from pictographs in a cave.
