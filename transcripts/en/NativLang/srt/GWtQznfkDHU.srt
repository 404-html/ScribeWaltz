1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,160
The conquest of Mexico. Yes, it
plagues it took guns. It took steel,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,210
but as the Spanish admitted would have
gone very differently without languages.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,430
1510 mezo America, Audi's to spoke
Maya and lived in a small kingdom,

4
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:21,750
run by its own real man. Seriously. A
local mine leader was a holiday week.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,420
A real man west of the Maya.

6
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,160
Many people spoke many languages from
many language families will domi support

7
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:33,180
tech Turtleneck,
but one group's been taking over.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,230
You know who straight from the Valley
of Mexico where the triple alliance,

9
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:42,090
you dare not defy us. The Aztecs,
their empire was built around.

10
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:46,800
I've Tippett city states each one
led by Inc Latwonda the speaker,

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,530
but one I'll tip it stood above the rest.
They know which deet land.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,730
A huge city floating on a lake,
home of high temples,

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,000
human sacrifice and the Aztec
empires way eat [inaudible].

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,250
Great Speaker.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,660
The current way [inaudible] is
Martech Soma Montezuma to you.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,960
He demands tribute from all of this
area or else or else flush Gulen.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,110
Their name may start with a very Aztec,
but make no mistake clash.

18
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,940
Scala is a proud and independent
warrior state. Pay Up to him.

19
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,730
We'll take Soma and rest easy.
Stay free,

20
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:25,260
but constantly watch your back for as
take obsidian. Flesh color says bring it.

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,720
I keep saying as tech,

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,550
but let's talk names as text means all
people from the legendary homeland Aztlan

23
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,510
at least it doesn't. The Aztec
language linguists call that language.

24
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,910
Know what TL and the related peoples are.
No one,

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,750
but that's just a way to say
speaking clearly for their part.

26
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,680
The epic as ticks of Aztec Empire fame
called themselves may Shika and their

27
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:51,450
land was Ms Sheeko, Mexico. The well,
we're over here debating terminology.

28
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:55,500
The bearded men start to arrive from
the east and events unfold that will

29
00:01:55,501 --> 00:02:00,420
conspire to put now what will end Maya
into the hands of Mexico's conquerors.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,700
1511 a shipwreck Spanish crew washes
up on the coast of the Yucatan and is

31
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,580
captured by Mayans too will survive.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,880
I get it at a fryer and the sailor
get rid of 1513 tubs school.

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,870
He's the Halloweeny could gave his name
to Tabasco. The state end, the Chili.

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,760
He battles nearby Shika Longo and
take slaves as a reward among them.

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,840
Is Malina. Lee and no one girl
who also spoke to on Pal Maya,

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,490
the kind of mine in that part of
the Gulf coast, 1517 bearded men,

37
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,040
Cordova lands in the Yucatan,
he's greeted,

38
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:39,870
warmly welcomed by the Maya success.
Nope. Turns out it's an ambush,

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,950
the Spanish retreat, but managed to nab
a mine on the way out. Maybe George Echo,

40
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,440
he'll be there first Mayan translator,

41
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,390
but a rough one and one will never
buy into this whole Spain thing. 1518,

42
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,710
another explorer.

43
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Grehalva takes military junta visit tab
scope who trades gifts and tells tales

44
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:02,890
of a wonderful land, the west with many
more treasures, a land called Michiko.

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,160
The curious Grehalva says, hmm, maybe
I'll stick around a bit, but tubs,

46
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:11,800
scopes been warned by my and allies to
keep these guys that distance and says,

47
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,090
I think it's time for you
to move along Cuba 1519.

48
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,640
This is where the bearded
men have been sailing from.

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,780
One of them just emptied his life
savings to pay for boats and crew to um,

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,170
explore the fabled riches of
Mexico in Non Cortez Cortez sales.

51
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,170
Tuku Samil Cozumel and sends out Middle
Georgia who to track down those two

52
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,970
shipwreck survivors, the sailor,
well, he's gone for good, not dead.

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,470
Turns out he went full lion. Seriously,
he became a champion warlord,

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,670
but the other guy I be loud is still
alive and his heart's still belongs to

55
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,010
Spain.
The fryer's back in action.

56
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,970
My in captivity turned [inaudible]
ladder into a real asset. See,

57
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:55,090
the Spanish haven't been big on
local languages. Case in point,

58
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,550
they use a word they learn back
in Cuba for every local chief,

59
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:02,520
they meet Gas Siki. You're a Mayan
Winnick [inaudible] a Mexican plateau.

60
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,780
[inaudible] the weight La 20
of the whole empire gas CK,

61
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,110
but not like he lied. He speaks
junk down. Maya now, well,

62
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:15,190
it's John Delta outsiders because he has
Aztec word junk. Fairly means foreigner.

63
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,940
We speak clearly. They on the other
hand, they speak like foreigners.

64
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,774
You know what I mean?

65
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,760
The people of Tabasco clearly disagree
because to them it's yokoten correct

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,600
language, whether you call it, I get
a lot of speech for inner correct.

67
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,580
Cortez immediately sees his value,

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,360
keeps him by his side and makes
him his language, his tongue.

69
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,130
Great time to talk to more
mines, starting with tubs, Kolbe,

70
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,100
but I don't think his town's taking to
the idea of even more bearded men showing

71
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:46,660
up. Seriously. These guys again, no
thanks. They put up quite a fight,

72
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,900
but with a little mine,
Intel and a big display of horsepower.

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,090
This Spanish to feed them in
the battle of settler tubs,

74
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,100
school berries is dead and
hands over a bounty bounty.

75
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,550
That includes that woman tab scrub
captured in 1513 Molly, Natalie,

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,230
this woman has a way with words,
not only can she speak with [inaudible],

77
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,830
she knows the Mexican language.
Also too many names.

78
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,470
Malina Lee took a Spanish name,
Donya Medina,

79
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,160
which got translated back into now
what we're with an honorific is suffix.

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,450
Seen Marlene scene that came
back into Spanish as Mcglinchey,

81
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,670
which is how she still
remembered in Mexico,

82
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,150
who Cortez now has a strategy.

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,880
He and idealabs speak
Spanish to each other.

84
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,370
I get a lot of turns to
Mallinson scene and speaks.

85
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,670
Maya and Mylene seen uses
now what with the Aztecs?

86
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,080
Until she eventually learned Spanish then,
sorry, Aggie life. You're out. Go team.

87
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:42,100
Laneless. Why the long chain
of communication though?
Why can't I get loud?

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,730
Just pick up some Aztec because
classical, now what? And Sean Paul.

89
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:48,730
Maya come from two completely
distinct language families.

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,030
It's like Chinese and English sort of.
See,

91
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,670
there's a unique linguistic mixing
that happened in Mesoamerica,

92
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:55,361
but that's so cool.

93
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:58,850
I'll save it for another video with
his linguists always by his side.

94
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,960
Go test begins to unravel the
resentment beneath the surface. See,

95
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,280
I don't know how you pictured it,

96
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,210
but this is not going to be a small band
of Spaniards standing alone against an

97
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,690
empire.
Success hinges on flipping allies.

98
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,920
Lots and lots of allies.
That's where team linguist comes in.

99
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,960
Spain flips the total knacks.

100
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,470
They down play in fighting and
scuttle their own ships to go. All in.

101
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,100
They learn of blush color.
They dare to enter to blush color.

102
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,460
The ferocious flush colon
warriors put up a major fight,

103
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,810
but the Spanish impressed the guest seek
gay and earn themselves a deeply loyal

104
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,190
ally against the Mashika.

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,520
The enemy of my enemy is my Maleen seen
flipping towns and butchering others.

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,600
This allied crew pushes on to 10 which
deadline knock knock Multex Soma,

107
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,860
and in November of 1519 well,
Dick Soma opens,

108
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,120
they enter the biggest, the most
impressive city they've ever seen.

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,220
The weight latony is carried out to them
and team linguists makes history and an

110
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,500
awkwardly gracious meeting between worlds.

111
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,060
We'll Texoma then launches into a flowery
NovoTAL. That's up for interpretation,

112
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,010
but I think we'll come
back to haunt the city.

113
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,430
Take the word for city state from earlier.
I'll tip it.

114
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,260
It literally means water hill.
Now listen to this line from well Texoma.

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,330
The Mutsun in motivates Betsy. Matson
and [inaudible] have the same roots,

116
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:24,680
water and hill plus the same formal
scene at the end of Marlene scene.

117
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,980
It's your water,
Sir and your hills sir.

118
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,520
He symbolically offering
the city to Cortez,

119
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,220
well to master lean shit.
See,

120
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,260
the Aztecs are addressing team linguist
not as Cortez, but as Marlene sin.

121
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,910
They even painted the pair side by side
in their own codices with her as the

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,870
speaker from here.

123
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:48,140
The history of this conquest turns
more tactical than linguistic.

124
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,450
Cortez takes more Texoma hostage months
of puppet ruler broken by a brutal

125
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:57,620
Spanish attack during the holiday of
Bullsh Scott that unleashes and as tick

126
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,310
uprising, which ends in the
death of Mattec Soma and many,

127
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:03,920
many Spaniards in allies
as they flee the city.

128
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,780
Regrouping and flush collar team
language secures more reinforcements and

129
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,340
performs a linguistic trick.

130
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,200
See test interpreted Mattec Somas poetic
speech in Matson in both the bed senior

131
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,270
has him handing the empire over.

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,620
If Spain was the rifle master that
makes the Aztecs officially, uh,

133
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:26,621
people in rebellion thus
follows the vengeful recruiting
of even more allies and

134
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,340
the outbreak of a major plague.

135
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,500
The empire shatters into basically a
civil war in central Mexico that implodes

136
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,070
into a final siege on thin watch.

137
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:40,071
Dateline a seizure that lasts the summer
of 1521 cost hundreds of thousands of

138
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:45,521
lives and ends with the city in
ruins while demo the final weight.

139
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,090
[inaudible] is spared only to be executed
by Cortez a few years later before his

140
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,380
death. He speaks out
with Aztec defiance. Oh,

141
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,350
captain McGlinchey long have I understood?

142
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,540
Have I known your false words?

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,720
Duplicity today in Mexico.

144
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,430
That's the kind of sting that the
