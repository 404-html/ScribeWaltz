1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,060
Celtic quiz for you. Does this Irish
names start with the sound puck?

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,880
The sound or the sound fun?
Yeah.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,920
You knew it was a trick
question, Huh? Me Indeed.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,180
Irish words can do something
quite unusual. They can mutate.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,710
They're starting sounds.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm busy piecing together the epic history
of Ganga tugging at threads grasping

7
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,630
for one that ties everything together.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,610
I'm noticing I barely have time for
name drops. Protal Celtic, boom. Next.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,430
Oh boom, boom. Next mutation. Boom. No,

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,190
no wait.

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,190
Let's explore that one in its preliterate
days about the most traumatic thing to

12
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:50,170
happen to the start of
Irish words was said.

13
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:55,150
It's peas fell off and
without this process today
we'd be speaking of Pyre land

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,570
so well,
Rome said [inaudible] and potter.

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,170
Irish has [inaudible] and I even Ireland's
oldest writing system is missing a

16
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,870
sign for that p but otherwise,

17
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:12,871
this ohms script has neat syllables
and beautiful inflected Celtic endings.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,460
Just a couple of hundred
years later though Goy the
Helga merged with a mystery.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,670
It was suddenly so different that it left.

20
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:26,170
Link was stumped how Irish could have
changed this fast from Owen out of the

21
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:31,171
blue or the emerald green come
manuscripts filled with mutations,

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,460
mutations that Irish will never let go of.
They come in two flavors.

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,340
First soft.
That's a flavor.

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,130
Chezvous inition weakens letters
into fricatives or even glides.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,650
Clen. [inaudible] Jess. Yes.

26
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,150
To who

27
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,730
some clinicians have changed since old
Irish like ha and girl were once in the,

28
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,400
we even lost my favorite lineation.

29
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,580
Today's war was once more the old clothes
settled on marking lineation with A.

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,130
Dot. Nowadays, you plop in an H.

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,360
Mutation number two is to
literally darkening or eclipse.

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,020
Eclipse automatically turns any
voiceless sound voiced become,

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,140
but the gut hook book,

34
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,783
Gree,

35
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,210
gree voiced consonants turn nasal
border more Ganga [inaudible].

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,820
If you count like this book, you'll
find a third mutation Hasper ration.

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,590
This one's about Val's specifically
adding h two vowels after some words that

38
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,110
end in a vowel kind of
breaks up the two vowels.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,010
Old Irish is but me,
haze and Aiden,

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,360
but the Hayden,

41
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,670
what makes mutations this
specially devious is that
they're triggered by grammar.

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,120
If you asked an old Irish
scribe who's check this is,

43
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,140
you better have known the difference
between masculine, feminine,

44
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:18,400
a cheque and plural, a JIC
and modern Irish. Oh yes.

45
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:22,840
It keeps doing this. I
Shah a chuck. I said, yeah,

46
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,130
this happens. Good. Your muck means a son.

47
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,050
Mk is a pig.
You say amok,

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,880
but unwork why?

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Because feminine some words triggering
eclipse instead it bought us and milia

50
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,900
clear every Florida

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,050
you will be his bay too. But
if I ask, it's unmade too.

52
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,950
And if you won't me vate too with no
word for yes or no mutations are a must.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,290
Where do these transfigurations come from?

54
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,750
Recall that those early
elegant grammatical inflections
had eroded this often

55
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:08,710
left old Irish,

56
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,190
nothing more than a slender consonant
to mark a meaningful difference.

57
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,520
Mk, MK, Dune,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,630
Dune with its endings crumbling around it.

59
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,870
Irish noticed something and just in
time the very words that triggered these

60
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,971
endings had also been messing with
beginnings triggers ending an a vowel like

61
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,050
the feminine article had been softening.

62
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:37,051
The next sound on muck and wook triggers
ending and a nasal naturally turned.

63
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,440
The next sound.
Nasal Gallagher and Gallagher.

64
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,160
Now with beginnings in place,

65
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,090
triggers themselves were free to
erode or even vanish entirely.

66
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,330
Irish had evolved in
new way to do grammar.

67
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,450
When did this happen?
Ask Welsh look,

68
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,980
come has mutations too.
Well then clearly these must be inherited.

69
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,710
Part of their shared
common Celtic ancestry.

70
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm told not.
Instead,

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,510
their parents gave them the tools.
Time provided the problem.

72
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,330
Each language came up
with its own solution.

73
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,670
So when you shout to pathetic remembered,
you use the vocative of Fondrick.

74
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,030
When you speak from the heart Omo cre,

75
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,930
and when something's in Irish,
it's Aigner

76
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,430
stick around and subscribe for language.
