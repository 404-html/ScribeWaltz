1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,260
Time ticks forward any English,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,890
but did you know in Mandarin earlier is
up and later is down or that the UK Tech

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,500
Maya have no word for before or after
these sound like the kind of fun facts you

4
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:19,830
share with a friend and then move on.
But for linguists,

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,320
time is at the center of a major debate.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,090
Are there languages out there were time
just doesn't work like we think it does.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,710
There's a linguist who spent his
entire career documenting and trying to

8
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:36,630
understand one language,

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,110
Hopi after four years of field
work in Arizona on the third Mesa,

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,590
surely he has real insights to share
about every aspect of the language.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,220
And yet in this lung book he
focuses on just one Hopi time,

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,050
over 600 pages of Hopi time.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,610
With example after example of how just
like English hope he has words for time,

14
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:03,060
like later temporarily,
the Hopi count days,

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,360
they use terms like over there as spatial
metaphors for time and their verbs

16
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:13,140
have tenses. They can mark
the future with ne time, time,

17
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,770
everywhere time. Okay, so
the hope he can tell time,

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,350
what's the big deal?
Well,

19
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,370
it must've mattered to someone because
linguists and psychologists and people

20
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:27,030
who never heard a word of hope in their
lives grabbed the book and held it high

21
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:32,031
as proof that time was universal for
humans and then they cursed the name of

22
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:37,680
warf. Warf was wrong.
Warf was a charlatan.

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,060
Warf was a con man. Oh
fuck. What's the fuss?

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,390
Whoever said that, the hope you
don't think about the past, present,

25
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:50,391
and future plus who's this wharf and
YC getting picked on so much worth.

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,520
What's a fire inspector,

27
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,960
but one with a unique hobby
Youdo as tech in languages.

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,180
This curiosity led him to Sapir
who took wharf under his wing.

29
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,630
Just, Hey, I've got some literature
that will blow your mind.

30
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,650
See Hambelton Boaz taught us how different
cultures subconsciously categorize

31
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,710
the world based on language,
but I think there's more.

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,110
I think people are at
the mercy of language.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,860
We're not living in the objective world,
man. We're living through our language.

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,980
What an hod idea,

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,700
but as worth turn to another
Uto-Aztecan language.

36
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,590
She started to see it.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,600
Hopi seemed so on European to
him in the way it handled time.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,790
There was no substance called time
and no timeline that could be cut and

39
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,683
counted.

40
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,950
No space as a metaphor for time
as if you could move through time,

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,340
not even a past, a
present, or a future tense.

42
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,620
The more worth studied Hopi,

43
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:53,970
the more he concluded that the Arrow of
time isn't something that exists in our

44
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,250
objective world.
Instead,

45
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:00,550
we think about time this way
because we speak average European.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,710
The Hopi don't share our concept
of time because they speak Hopi.

47
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,960
How do the Hopi live without
tense? Well, for warf,

48
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,810
Hopi time is about cycles.
Rituals,

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,080
mental preparation for key events.
Above all,

50
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,660
they have no objective time.

51
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,700
Sapir died at age 55 and warf
joined him a couple years later,

52
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,970
age to 44 but his ideas were captivating.

53
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,570
Do people think about time
differently in different languages?

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,630
Does your language shape
your concept of time?

55
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,280
Does the language you speak to determine
whether or not time even exists for you?

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,690
These claims from weak to strong
got the Nickname Sapir wharf,

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,090
which I often hear pronounced saper wharf.

58
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,570
Hopi time became it's posterchild
and an ever growing big fish tail.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Hope he is innocent of a
category for time and no worse.

60
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,220
Our concept of time would
be in comprehensible to them
better yet the reason you

61
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:07,561
have clocks and watches is because you
aren't Hopi and my favorite hobby time

62
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:12,430
makes for better family therapy then
the Aristotelian reality western parents

63
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,264
are stuck in.

64
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,270
So now do you see the power of the
600 pages spent vanquishing wharf and

65
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,760
mainstreaming?
Hopi linguists had had enough.

66
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,230
Many of them wanted to focus on what
made language universal and in nature to

67
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,280
all of us stop parading around
Hopi as an exotic oddity.

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,140
We all think the same way.

69
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,780
We just express ourselves with
a little linguistic flair.

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,950
So then time is time is time.
It's settled,

71
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,140
not quite. dot.dot. Years after Hopi time,

72
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,160
researchers claim that they'd found new
evidence showing wharf was right about

73
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:48,521
time.

74
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,930
All along like this set of experiments
playing on the difference between how

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,960
English and Mandarin speakers you space
to talk about time earlier is to your

76
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:03,160
left and later to your right in English.
But in Mandarin, things can get vertical.

77
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,100
Earlier is up and later down.

78
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,700
Even though these experiments were
conducted entirely in English,

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,530
native Mandarin speakers were quicker
to answer simple questions about earlier

80
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,650
or later after being primed
with vertical tos. Well,

81
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,760
native English speakers were
faster after horizontal cues.

82
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,080
Thinking about time,
it seemed was shaped by language.

83
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,500
The masses were intrigued,
myself included,

84
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,920
someone passed me a link to it
and my work inbox years ago,

85
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,080
and I wasn't even working with linguists,

86
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,660
but in the comments of
my old video about warf,

87
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,830
a researcher did mention having trouble
replicating these results from what I've

88
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:45,430
read since then,
that commentary isn't alone still.

89
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:49,870
It was just one of the many wharf like
effects that kept making the news some

90
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:53,800
from scientific tests in the lab,
others from fieldwork on the ground.

91
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,200
So in the central Andes, there's a
language spoken by millions called Imada.

92
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,250
In Aymara, you're Neda, your eye
is in front of you and your keeper,

93
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,430
you're back is behind you.
That's normal.

94
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,670
But this isn't when talking about time,

95
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,030
the eye motto speak as
if they face the past,

96
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,820
but they have their backs to the future.

97
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,560
They even point behind their
backs to gesture into the future.

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,860
So their eyes are exactly
where your eyes are,

99
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,970
but their past is not
where your past is rare,

100
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,523
unique,

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,250
but there's something else about I
Mana and hoping at second glance,

102
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:41,880
some linguists tell us both of
them are best viewed as tenseness.

103
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,250
Wait, there are timeless
languages out there. What?

104
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,880
Well kind of tense lists.
It's not as odd as it first sounds.

105
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,330
We already know of languages that
are uncontroversially tenseness take.

106
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,250
You could tech Maya.
Not only are they missing a past,

107
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,140
present and future tense.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,970
They even lack words like
before until and after.

109
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,340
How in the world do they talk
about time? Well, strategies,

110
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,000
complex strategies like context aspect.

111
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,910
It could make a fun followup to dig
into the mechanics of how Tencent's

112
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,250
languages talk about time,

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,930
but good luck proving any of this makes
them experience time in a fundamentally

114
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,760
different way.
You could,

115
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:30,410
tech speakers do fine and experiments
about linear time and any effects are

116
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:34,580
subtle. See if you read the research
and not the breaking headlines,

117
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,360
strong ideas of language,
determining time. Those are out.

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Any ongoing debates are about
subtler influences in the end.

119
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,900
Languages do talk about time differently,

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,830
but it's harder to get speakers to behave
differently based on their language.

121
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,450
But I'll level with you.

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,020
I get the sense of trivia about
time and tenses was never the point.

123
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,360
Hopi time became a mascot for a
grander idea. Linguistic relativity,

124
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,160
whereas Sapir put it, different
societies live in distinct worlds,

125
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,520
not merely the same world with
different labels attached.

126
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,210
That's an idea I suspect we'll run
into again in the future until then.

127
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,620
Stick around it.
Subscribed for language.
