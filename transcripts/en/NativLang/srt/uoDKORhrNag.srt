00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
This video continues my series about the
various types of regular sound changes

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,170
that happen over time in language.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,030
Last time we considered situations where
existing sounds became more or less

4
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:26,420
similar to one another.
Assimilation and dissimilation.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,160
This time it's all about sounds that
get added to or deleted from words.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,680
When a sound is added to a word
that's called a parenthesis.

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,180
The new phoneme is an empathetic sound.
For instance,

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,200
you may have heard some English speakers
add an epithetic are to the word

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,570
Sherbet pronouncing it Sherbert.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,760
Not all added sounds of the same
is the additional sound of vowel.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,300
That's an up Texas Sardinian speakers
changed Rosa to outer Rosa by adding an an

12
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:02,090
up tick.
Tick Val to the front of the word

13
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,270
is the edit sound. That consonant
if so, that's called excrescence.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Ancient Greek speakers
sometimes pronounced their
word st as as team adding an

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,620
excrescence consonant.

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,740
Not all in parenthesis happens in the
same place either if the phoneme is added

17
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,590
to the beginning of a word,
it's called pro thesis.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,080
The Sardinian example at
Rosa adds a pathetic APP.

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,810
If the phoneme is added to the end
of a word, it's called paragogy.

20
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,580
The ancient Greek word esteem
as a pair of [inaudible], n

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,740
Elysian happens when a sound
is removed from a word.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,520
The last phoneme is said
to be elided or deleted.

23
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,500
The final book sound has been
alighted from the English word thumb.

24
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,730
Compare the book and thimble.

25
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,263
Okay.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Is the phoneme removed from the
beginning of a word? That's a Ferris.

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,520
For example, English speakers may
shorten about time too. About time.

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,600
Is this sound removed
from the middle of award?

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,600
This kind of allision is known as syncope.

30
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,460
This we send you a word,

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,970
meaning the bears is pronounced
[inaudible] speakers.

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,940
Cinco paid that middle.
Who

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,530
is the phoneme removed
from the end of a word?

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,080
That change gets called a pocket.
So the word thumb,

35
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,800
losing its final bow over time
is an example of a pocket.

36
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,860
So this has been a quick
ground level understanding
of a pen stasis and allision.

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,780
In the next video,

38
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:59,080
I'll pick out a few types of sound
changes we haven't seen so far.
