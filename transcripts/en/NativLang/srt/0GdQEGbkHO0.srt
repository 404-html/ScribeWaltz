00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,890
MMM.

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,950
Hello and welcome to the third lesson
in native laying dotcoms course on

3
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:17,200
historical linguistics
and language change.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,070
This time around using the concepts
that you learned in the last lesson,

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,160
namely cognates,
which are inherited words,

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,410
borrowings and chance.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,610
I want you to take a look for a minute
at some basic core words from four

8
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:34,750
languages. These languages
are Italian, Galician,

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,550
Portuguese,
and Mallory.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,590
These words are actually
fairly representative of
the relationships between

11
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:42,520
these languages.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,740
Take a moment to consider which
languages share a common ancestry and how

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,140
closely these languages must be related.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,413
Wow.

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,810
We have good grounds for considering
that Portuguese and Galician are very

16
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:16,400
closely related. We also have
grounds for saying that Italian,

17
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,310
Portuguese and coalition
are less closely related,

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,470
but they're all related to each other.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,180
As long as we grouped Galician in
Portuguese more closely together in this

20
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,100
relationship,
we can say that Italian,

21
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:30,650
Galician and Portuguese are
all related to each other.

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,340
Now are you on the other hand?
Doesn't seem to be related at all,

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,510
so at this point we'll set it to the
side and say that it's an unrelated

24
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:42,080
language. That is, it may be
related to other languages,

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,090
but it is not related to Italian Galician
in Portuguese at least as far as we

26
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:51,970
can tell this set of words,
but that's not enough at this point.

27
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:55,090
We just have a flat understanding
of the relationships.

28
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,170
We should extend this back the
same way we do with a family tree.

29
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,720
Now what we'll do is we'll group Galician
in Portuguese together in one branch

30
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:08,500
of the tree and then Italian in
a separate branch of the tree,

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,150
so now we've extended this
relationship back over time.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,900
The branches that extend upwards on this
diagram show you that in the past these

33
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:24,100
languages were actually more closely
related to each other. In other words,

34
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,710
they diverge from common ancestors.

35
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,560
In the case of Galician in Portuguese,

36
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,790
they actually diverged from a
nearer common ancestor. Right?

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,810
You see that note?

38
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,280
This note here is the common ancestor
of both collision and Portuguese.

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,820
No, this no tears. Also
related to Italian.

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,230
There's an even further note
meaning further back in time.

41
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,400
That is the common ancestor of
Italian Galician in Portuguese.

42
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,230
Now we have two question marks here.
What do these question marks mean?

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,430
They're just notes on our diagram,
but they more than that,

44
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,350
there's actually some language spoken
in the past that must be the common

45
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,310
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese.
Otherwise they wouldn't be around.

46
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,650
They wouldn't share these common cognates,

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,970
so these common cognates derived
from words in a single language,

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,250
this single ancestor language.

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,240
Now there's an even more remote
common ancestor from Galician,

50
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,560
Portuguese and Italian,

51
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,890
and that's a form of vulgar
Latin in at least some small way.

52
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:34,240
These two languages, Galician,
Portuguese and vulgar Latin are a tested.

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,390
That means we have documents
we can look back at.

54
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,770
We can look today at documents that
were written in those languages.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,840
We have some attestation of their
existence. We know what they look like.

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,460
We can see their vocabulary items and
written words and based on other evidence,

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,180
we actually have some knowledge of
how those words were pronounced.

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,810
These were real languages
that are documented.

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,260
What happens when we don't
have that kind of attestation?

60
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,110
We'll have to get a little
bit more innovative.

61
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,090
We'll have to use something known as
reconstruction to posit a hypothetical

62
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,870
ancestor language.
That's the parent of the modern languages.

63
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,250
In our next lesson,
we'll look at how exactly we do that,

64
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,910
and we'll go about doing two basic
reconstructions to help you get an

65
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,690
understanding for the process of
how we would look back in time,

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,870
how we would reconstruct
an ancestor language.

67
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,160
I hope you'll join me as we do that and
gain some more perspective on historical

68
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:33,670
linguistics.
