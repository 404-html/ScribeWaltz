1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,570
How did Egyptian hieroglyphs
give birth to the alphabet?

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,740
Even in these ancient times in monuments
have been sitting and weathering for

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,170
thousands of years on their
great murals and pillars.

4
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:20,800
You find rows of little
pictures, sorry, not pictures,

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,420
hieroglyphs sacred symbols,
but despite appearances,

6
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:30,100
this isn't some mysterious, very onic
picture writing. It's confidence.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,470
One consonant signs, two consonant
signs, three consonant signs.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,050
Oh, wall of consonants, plus a sprinkle
of logo grass for determinative.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,690
It's not that Egyptian was a harsh
bowel list and desert of a tongue.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,500
It's simply did not right at the bowels.
Imagine if you wrote this way,

11
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,240
would that work?

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,810
And then imagine if you could add in
logo graphs to make sure you really got

13
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:53,740
your point across.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Imagine you wrote like that and you're
thinking with hieroglyphs too difficult,

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,180
fine off to the caves with you where
you toil away with ancient miners on the

16
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:05,200
Sinai peninsula,

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,400
you and your fellow miners would find it
handy to leave messages for one another,

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,570
but there's no time for deep studies
of rows of fancy hieroglyphs in here.

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,010
You need to keep it simple.
If you want another major moments.

20
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:25,000
In the history of writing.
Your characters look like scratchy,

21
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,790
rushed version of those
glamorous Egyptian symbols,

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,800
but they're meeting
doesn't matter anymore.

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,310
Nothing but consonants and the same
symbol for the same continent every time.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,280
Take this character in addiction.
It means health.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,730
The Semitic miners are calling a house
a bet [inaudible] or top sounds suggest

26
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:49,330
that you can just take the first letter
of a word like the Egyptians had already

27
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,250
been doing with much of
their continent writing.

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,080
You end up with a letter for your sound.
Buh. Do the same thing with water,

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,320
which the Semitic speakers are calling
mem and you now have an mm sound with a

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,390
couple of dozen elegant simplifications.
You create a simple,

31
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,150
reliable list of consonants,
an alphabet,

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,160
and you've given generations of future
children the joys of reciting their abcs.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,060
Actually at this point in history there
ab GDS sometimes called an object or ob

34
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,310
God because who needs that wishy washy.

35
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:26,311
See when you can just use an s or a
k after a long hard day of mining an

36
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:30,730
etching, you turn to find that someone's
been watching you this whole time.

37
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,530
She's a trader. A Phoenician merchant
who knows a good thing when she sees it.

38
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,850
She's already made major cash and the
paper business where they turned tufty

39
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:44,350
stocky, swampy Egyptian papyri this
into flat ink couple sheets of paper.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,630
She rushes back home to
Phoenicia and smirks.

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,263
Think of the,

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,700
she has keeping track of whatever anyone
else tells her just by remembering

43
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,850
about as many characters as she has.
Fingers and toes.

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,320
All the kings can keep their up two's
hieroglyphs and their stone monuments.

45
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,180
The future of the Mediterranean will
belong to alphabets and paper writing is

46
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,080
going portable.

47
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,790
She uses this new found alphabetic
leverage to turn a huge profit across the

48
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,380
entire eastern Mediterranean,

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,820
leaving people inspired to adopt and
adopt her alphabet wherever she goes.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,530
All this and she doesn't even write you
a thank you card. How hard could it be?

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,420
Writing is easier than ever.

52
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,250
It feels universal like writings
here to stay for everyone,

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,150
but there is a peculiar quirk
that's easier to spot. In hindsight,

54
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,530
you and your mind crew,

55
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:48,640
we're communicating in a Semitic
language Phoenicians a Semitic language.

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,660
All of these friendly shades of the
Phoenician alphabet were being used for

57
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:55,600
languages that sounded similar
and worked much the same way.

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,370
Even Egyptian though,

59
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,510
no Semitic language itself is at least
a distant relative of the Semitic

60
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:05,080
languages with a similar personality.
This continent,

61
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:09,670
alphabet is being tested in easy waters,
but history is shaking things up.

62
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,070
Who are merchant friend
comes back for your help.

63
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,210
She needs you to deliver your alphabet
to a very different people living along

64
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,044
her trade route.

65
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,960
Okay.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,200
What will happen when the alphabet
gets leaked outside of the family?
