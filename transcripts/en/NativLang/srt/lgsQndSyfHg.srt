1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,050
Well, it looks at first
glance like ancient art is
actually a full blown Britain

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:04,884
language,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,820
but what does this homegrown Mesoamerican
script teach us about the history of

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:09,654
writing?

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,870
I elaborate Rosa
characters onto a stealer.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,220
A tall stone brought in from far away
that's now standing straight up in the

7
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:26,800
middle of the city.
The characters he's carving.

8
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:30,790
Look more like detailed pictures than
writing, but don't let that fool you.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,630
Take a look at this block. It
means mountain, but it's not.

10
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:38,500
Although the graph standing for mountain,
it's not a rebus symbol. Brewer,

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,450
think of a word that rhymes
with [inaudible] mountain.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,840
It's actually a block of two sound
symbols that spell the word [inaudible].

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,190
The [inaudible] word for mountain.
That's great for climbers,

14
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:52,120
but chocolate lovers may instead prefer
to sampled these three symbols that

15
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:56,470
together though the word to cow cocoa,
there's a nifty shortcut here.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,600
This bit doesn't even mean car.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,590
It's actually a syllable
multiplier or iteration mark,

18
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:04,000
if you want the fancy name.

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,843
Sure.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,950
I think you're being watched
over there in the jungle.

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,803
Maybe not.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,893
Hmm.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,950
Major moments in the history of
writing both of these Maya glyphs,

24
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,920
combined syllable characters
into blocks to write words.

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,560
This is full fledged sound writing.

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,030
These are Loga graphs that happened
to be read as sounds. They are sounds,

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,250
sounds capable of writing any syllable
and the language in a full syllabary like

28
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,480
the classical Maya script.

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,020
There are separate characters for just
about every possible syllable in the

30
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,240
language.
No longer must have been meant.

31
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:48,590
New Word characters you can make do
with a much smaller set of syllable

32
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,570
characters.
Nice,

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,230
but syllable writing comes
with its own set of problems.

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,400
Here's a cliff that's quite
useful around these parts. Jaguar,

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,590
the word is actually belong,

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,870
but have you noticed something about the
Mayan syllabary consonant plus vowel,

37
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,530
consonant plus bowel,
more consonants plus more vowels.

38
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,140
All of these syllables,
Indian vowels.

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,610
How in the world are you supposed
to write the Lum in Balaam,

40
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,470
shifty, scripty syllabi
areas have grappled with this
problem and settled on two

41
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:25,070
solutions. One, leave
out the final letter.

42
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,630
Just ignore it.

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,160
The term for this is under spelling
because you're not fully spelling the word

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,390
and it's a good solution because you
know ignoring your problems makes them go

45
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:40,190
away. Option to spell the last
letter with an extra syllable,

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,120
but use a syllable that just repeats the
last vowel so that we know we can just

47
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:47,420
ignore the final vowel.
This gets called the echo vowel.

48
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,420
Mayan likes number two a lot.

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,470
So the cow is Kako wa well,

50
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,130
because times to Wa wheats,

51
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,430
the mountain is actually we see.

52
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,300
And your new pet Balaam is spelled Bala.
Ma.

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,320
Cross out the echo vowels and the
words practically read themselves.

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,040
Your new friend pulls you along
to show you another project.

55
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,810
He's working on an Amati Codex.
That's a paper book. Yes,

56
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,160
he has paper and yes books,
but that's not what's got him excited.

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,290
He folds open the book he's working
on maybe to share new ideas. No,

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,190
to brag about how inventive
and potentially efficient
his writing system is.

59
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,710
Know for his people.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,740
The invention of the new
wasn't about ditching the old.

61
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,160
He shows you how creative he's been
with the characters you learned.

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,070
He shows you a mountain
and calls it weeds,

63
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,360
and then a Jaguar and calls
it Bilam low good graphs.

64
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,000
Wait a second,
you stop and ask him,

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,040
which is the correct way to write belong.
He writes Balama.

66
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,670
You ask him to write it again,
and he writes the logo graph,

67
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,220
but with the syllable and again,

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,160
but he writes the Loga
graph plus two syllables.

69
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,060
He smiles mischievously.
They're all below them.

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,930
This is what he's proud of.
He can write the same word,

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,310
even the same syllable in different
ways and combinations without repeating

72
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,050
himself creative, but his use of
logo graphs plus syllables or calls.

73
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,340
The tension between sound writing,
meaning writing meaningful, determinative,

74
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,250
helped us choose the right
pronunciation for our rebus character.

75
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,720
And my end Luga graphs can still do that,
but the helping hand goes both ways.

76
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,510
The syllabary can also clarify the sounds
you should make when you read a little

77
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:37,950
graph.
Here's the character Jaguar,

78
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,680
but at a couple extra syllable hints and
you make it clear that we're meant to

79
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,150
read this cliff as Bala Ma
minus the echo vowel. So Balaam.

80
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,320
These are phonetic compliments,
pronunciation, clis,

81
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:53,620
sitting comfortably alongside logo graphs.
If that's all too complex.

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,530
Just remember that you can
write everything in syllables,

83
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,270
but before you have time to settle
into this land of Balaam and Cacau to

84
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:05,830
practice those syllables, a sandy
wind starts blowing in from the east,

85
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,270
uh, familiar reminder from a faraway
land. We're even more dramatic.

86
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,010
Changes are about to shape
the future of writing.
