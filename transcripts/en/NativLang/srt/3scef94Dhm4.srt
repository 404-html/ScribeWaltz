1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,930
Etymology,
semantics and meaning change.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,450
So far. We followed the trail of various
forms of a word as it changed over time,

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,430
but just stating that for example,

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:16,431
Quain became queen ignores one crucial
aspect and aspect that initially attracts

5
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,460
most amateur enthusiasts of etymology.
Semantics.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,260
When it comes to Etymology,

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:25,980
semantics deals with the meaning
of words and parts of words. Now,

8
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,060
semantics tends to be fuzzy in two ways.
First,

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:33,900
the relationship between the meaning of
a word and its form is generally opaque.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,393
Second,

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,500
the semantic relationship between word
forms given that they're meaning is known

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,640
and even between word roots and words
derived from those same routes through

13
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:48,020
word formation is
approximate and variable. Uh,

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,720
consider the relationship between the
meaning of house and the meaning of home

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,130
or the etymological re in
remain versus in reappear,

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,450
we cannot simply set semantic
relatedness to true or false.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,270
We have to be aware of and
capture the gradations of meaning.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,470
Like sound informed,
meaning changes over time.

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,080
We can classify meaning changes into
types abstract too, or from concrete,

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,340
general two or from specific
temporal two or from Lockette IV.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,180
We can also consider the origin of
a meaning change or the influence of

22
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,540
languages. For example, calcs, calcs form.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,380
When speakers borrow patterns found in
another language to express a meaning

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,650
rather than bar.
The Latin expressed the expression,

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,190
we are locked here for our
galaxy English speakers CALC.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,200
We are lack there as a new native
term Milky Way. Other times,

27
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:45,201
semantic loans occur when a language uses
preexist preexisting word or phrase to

28
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,740
cover a borrowed meaning.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,290
We can also talk about
meeting and use words in use.

30
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,190
Maybe this be described as
literary poetic, archaic,

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,320
obsolete, obsolescent
jargon, colloquial, slang,

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,980
preferred and so on.
But however we classify it,

33
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:09,660
semantic changes not as systematic as
sound change under the real regularity

34
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,180
hypothesis. We expect
that it, for example,

35
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:17,181
if the African became the in a language
words that once began with that,

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,140
we'll now start with Z.

37
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,570
Don't expect the same from say an
abstract to concrete semantic change.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,960
Not all abstract meanings will
become concrete in a language.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,150
A last note about meaning change.
Uh,

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,790
the basic core vocabulary of a language
contains words that tend not to be

41
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,440
replaced and whose meanings do not
shift as much as the name implies.

42
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,150
These words include basic terms like
family members, terms for for earth,

43
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:48,920
Sun and other words learned
early and often. Um,

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,420
let's go back and look at
our etymology of Queen.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,810
You saw that the word came
from old English Quinn.

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,440
Let's add our semantics in old English.
That word meant woman.

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,940
What's more the Proto Germanic word,

48
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:05,560
Quinn is and most cognates and other
Indo European languages like Greek Kunae

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,450
mean woman or wife.

50
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,520
It's safe to say that the pro Indo
European root Gwane also meant woman.

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,100
This is an example of meaning change.

52
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,990
The meaning shifts from general woman
to a more specific female monarch.

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,850
As you read etymologies
or build an etymology,

54
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,810
there are some conventions worth noting.
The source language,

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,350
word and meaning are indicated
for earlier attested forms.

56
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,620
Parts of speech are sometimes given,

57
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:39,310
such as now an adjective or verb language.

58
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:44,311
Names are abbreviated and dates and
sources support more thorough etymologies.

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,540
The complex relationships between cognates
and dialects are board boiled down to

60
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,500
clear examples with relevant semantic
information given. For each example,

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,730
either by choosing the most representative
attested word or by citing a

62
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,500
reconstructed ancestral form.

63
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,240
Comparative examples are also cited.
Again,

64
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,270
reconstructions are marked
with an asterisk and um,

65
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,300
words of trace back as far as possible.

66
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,300
Sometimes in etymology
becomes unclear contested,

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,680
in which case the uncertainty is mentioned
and the multiple possible origins are

68
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:21,790
cited. For instance, there a double
etymologies and cases of influence.

69
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,200
Um, the English. Now fuse
comes from Italian Fuso,

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,070
but it's a dermatology was
influenced by the French word fuzzy.

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,830
Let's conclude this discussion
of Etymology by considering
the context in which

72
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:39,740
we may stumble upon etymologies,
you'll often find it,

73
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:43,310
I'm ologies and major dictionaries
following definitions of many words.

74
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,110
You can also get your
hands on dictionaries of
Prodo language, root words.

75
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:52,520
If you're interested in doing etymology
and reverse determining the words that

76
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:56,990
have descended from some root word in
a specific reconstructed language like

77
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,290
Prodo, Indo European or Prodo, Mayan.

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,530
A common source of
etymologies is folk etymology,

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,150
the popular telling and retelling
of the stories behind the word folk.

80
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:13,151
Etymologies often focus on
names and popular phrases
like mind your p's and q's.

81
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,730
Of course, full get them ologies that
are not always factually correct,

82
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,870
but more importantly,

83
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:21,410
they're never accurate enough to count
as thorough linguistic etymologies.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,730
Folk etymologists are
interested in storytelling,
entertainment, and credibility,

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,030
not precision and evidential
support. Speaking of names, uh,

86
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,630
on a mastic studies,
the etymology of proper names,

87
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,620
automatics is different because the
meaning of words that turn into names, uh,

88
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,860
10 to become vestigial.

89
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,190
The name proper comes to refer to
the identity of a person or place,

90
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:46,850
but the etymology still
interests even non specialists.

91
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,200
What's more words derived from the same
source can change in different ways when

92
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,460
they're used as a proper noun.

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,650
Names may be more conservative over
time or capture the history of and

94
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,350
interactions with surrounding languages.
For example,

95
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,470
the French name Jack preserves an old
nominative singular case ending s which

96
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,370
common nouns lost in French.

97
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,680
The Spanish name [inaudible] contains
a visit gothic route with a patronymics

98
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:17,000
suffix. That's all for this
introduction to etymology.

99
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,600
I hope it's helped you understand it.
Analogy. From a linguistic perspective,

100
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,160
you can see that, well, an etymology won't
tell you what the word actually means.

101
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,010
That's determined by how speakers
of a language use that word.

102
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,450
It does tell the sometimes fascinating
and unexpected history of the development

103
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:36,110
of words in a language. The next
time you hear look up an entomology,

104
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,680
you'll be able to take a more critical
and rigorous look at the origin of a word.
