1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,040
In the last two videos you learn to think
about the structure of language using

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:17,450
logic. I introduced using symbols for
constants and variables and how to break

3
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,370
statements into subject and predicate.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,300
It's time to look at some logical symbols
that will give our sentences a bit

5
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:26,570
more structure.
Starting with quantifiers,

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,920
when we talk about a quantity,
we mean how many of something there are,

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,650
but ordinary language is fairly general,

8
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:38,540
even vague in its treatment of
quantity one house, two or more houses.

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,700
This is actually true of logic to,
we'll look at three basic quantities,

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,710
none.
Some,

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,800
which is one or more and all each
of these quantities is the symbol.

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,090
So we will have three symbols that
we can call quantifiers. First,

13
00:00:56,091 --> 00:01:00,440
here's the quantifier all. Remember
when we use predicates with variables,

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,680
we ended up with sentences
like x is a person,

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,800
but this doesn't tell us
anything about that x.

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,540
Let's use x as a quantified
for any x.X is a person.

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,340
Let's try that with the sentence.

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,120
X saw why we get for any ex ex SAL.

19
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:22,121
Why one step further with
four MDX for any y x saw.

20
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,400
Why?
When I use any with these variables,

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,150
I'm really referring to all the
things x and y can stand for,

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,750
so let's throw the universal
quantify are all into the mix.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,540
We get the sentence for all x.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,690
X is a person in ordinary language.

25
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:43,310
You can read that as all of them are
people or just all people or all humans.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,100
Let's look at another one for all eggs.
Jill saw x here.

27
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,740
We're basically saying
Jill saw everything,

28
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,760
but if we abandon these quantifiers and
just let the predicate we'd end up with

29
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,260
blank is a person and Jill saw Blake.
Okay,

30
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,860
let's move to another symbol.
This one is the existential quantified.

31
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,400
It acts like the universal quantifier.
All you just learned about,

32
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:11,870
but instead it means some or more
specifically there exists at least one.

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,520
Let's go back to our variable x.
In the phrase x is a person.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,060
Let's say we wanted to talk about
some person. In other words,

35
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,890
for some x where x is a person will
need to use an existential quantified.

36
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,270
We'll also, you need to use it for
the sentence. Jill saw something.

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,920
Remember that Jill saw everything.
Use the universal quantify or all,

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,990
but for Jill saw something,

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,790
we'll use the quantify or some
our final quantifiers the symbol.

40
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,370
No.
Take a statement.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,110
P This p might represent John
saw the movie or my house is red.

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,000
Then the negation of that statement,

43
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:54,620
not p would have the same form as John
didn't see the movie or my house isn't

44
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:59,090
red. I'm listening to ways of writing
the not symbol, but both have the same.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,120
Take another statement this time with
an individual constant and a predicate.

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,320
As you saw in the last lesson, you can
write, John saw the movie this way.

47
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,920
Now let's turn the state same
statement into a negative.

48
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,190
John didn't see the movie.
See how that works.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,810
Same goes for my house isn't red.
That's how a predicate is negated.

50
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,170
Same applies to the
predicates with variables.

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,650
X isn't a person x didn't see why,

52
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,060
but don't forget that you learned to
quantify or variables with all in.

53
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,920
Some take examples with a variable
like some person which I wrote as there

54
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,921
exists at least one x where x is a
person and all people or for all x,

55
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,630
x is a person. We can actually negate both
of these. Think about it for a moment.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
If we negate this some x,

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,970
what does it mean not for some x.

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,380
X is a person that's
no people or no person.

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,180
If we negate this universal quantifier
over here, what does that mean?

60
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,370
Not all x where x is a person.
Consider the difference.

61
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,570
If there is not some eggs,
then there is no x.

62
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,070
If there is not all ex,
we're still left with some ex.

63
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,500
Take another example to be clear on this,

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,890
something is a turtle versus
everything is a turtle.

65
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,240
If I negate the first one I get,
nothing is a turtle.

66
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,810
If I negate the second one I get not
everything is a turtle before you take one

67
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,080
of fires and run with them.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,430
Consider how we'd been using variables
with quantifiers instead of translating

69
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,390
all languages this way
we'll say for all x,

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,560
x is a language.

71
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,190
Same Way with the existential quantify
the logic for some fish is given some x,

72
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,960
x is a fish.

73
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,610
This is how you will use predicates and
variables to lay out logical sentences.

74
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,150
Let's look at how to render
more general terms in logic.

75
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,920
When we have words like someone somewhere,
some thing and the like,

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,080
the existential quantify or comes
into play. Someone is for some x,

77
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:08,920
x is human,

78
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,750
some thing is for some x or if you're
trying to bring out it's thingness given

79
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:18,190
some x, x is a thing. With that in mind,

80
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:22,600
what's everybody and everything in logic?
Take a moment to think about it.

81
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,730
Okay. If your answers you see universal
quantifier, congratulations. If not,

82
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,980
don't despair.
There are many more examples to come.

83
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,720
This gives you some perspective
on the scope of a quantifier.

84
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,770
Variables have a predicate,
are bound by a quantify or to their left.

85
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,690
The nearest applicable quantify or to be
precise acts is bound by quantify or on

86
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,790
x,
y by a quantifier on why?

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,310
In the proposition for all x x,
Y,

88
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,030
x is bound by the universal quantifier,
but why is free on the other hand?

89
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:59,660
Both X and y are bound in for all x.
There exists some y where x sees.

90
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,494
Why.

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,690
Notice that the predicate xcs why falls
within the scope of these quantifiers.

92
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,210
The variables x and y are also
bound in the following cases for x.

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,110
X is red,

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,030
and given y x sees why
in that second example,

95
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,290
why is bound, but x is free. Why
would you want to bind variables?

96
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,410
This is crucial to your logic.
Picture it this way.

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,460
The variables is like a blank space.
John saw Blake.

98
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,540
If you bind the variable,
you can form a sentence in a language.

99
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,470
John saw something,
otherwise you're leaving the blank space.

100
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,990
They're binding requires more work,

101
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,740
but it's crucial to logical thinking
and modeling real sentences, logic.

102
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,270
Now let's get to some translations
before we bring this lesson to a close.

103
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,450
Do your best to come up
with the following in logic.

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,613
Okay,

105
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,800
and there you have it. Next time we'll
take a look at logical operators,

106
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:28,530
which will add some flesh to the
bones of your logic skill on it.
