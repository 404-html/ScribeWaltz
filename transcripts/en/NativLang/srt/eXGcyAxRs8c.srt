1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,393
Okay.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,550
What is logic?

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,010
I'll admit I will have difficulty finding
a straight forward way of defining

4
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:29,011
what logic is that will satisfy everyone
who uses it and everybody who studies

5
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:30,424
it.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,510
But if you weren't watching this video
with me asking that question right now,

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,080
you'd probably head over to
your favorite no, it all site.

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,910
You know the one I'm talking about and
it would tell you that logic deals with

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,440
valid reasoning. Perhaps we
could call it structured thought,

10
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,100
maybe even well structured thought.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,150
I'll return to that difference
between reasoning and reasoning. Well,

12
00:00:55,151 --> 00:01:00,040
since that split does come up in the
historical back and forth dialogue on how

13
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,260
to conceptualize and understand logic,

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,520
but first let's travel back to but one
of the ancient peoples who started to

15
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:13,930
talk about logic explicitly and use it to
hone their language in their arguments.

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,490
In Ancient Greece,

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,710
there lived a talkative and thoughtful
fellow who was socially awkward enough

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,800
that he failed to respect
conversational boundaries,

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,150
yet smart enough that he knew how to
call people out on their full of ships.

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,680
This is of course Socrates who
actually didn't claim he was so smart.

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,710
He went around asking folks
about presumably basic
topics like courage and self

22
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:43,480
control, claiming that he didn't
really understand these himself.

23
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,290
He asked a parent experts to walk him
through the details so that he could come

24
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:53,760
to understand them at least a little bit,
but as Plato tells it,

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,630
these initially light conversations go
from bad to worse as the experts can't

26
00:01:58,631 --> 00:01:59,031
manage.

27
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:03,340
She gives Socrates a solid case for
their own perspectives on these topics.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,623
In fact,

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,990
they're routinely forced to admit that
they don't really know what they're

30
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,824
talking about,

31
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,180
but more than an ancient tale
of intellectual upmanship.

32
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,700
This is among history most iconic
demonstrations of logic, inaction

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,160
in a logical nutshell,

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,670
attempting to define words and sentences
meaningfully and precisely structuring

35
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:32,221
sentences into an argument and checking
to make sure that that argument and

36
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:37,180
those meanings produce a coherent line
of reasoning that has a shot at drawing a

37
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,014
true conclusion

38
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,790
like other figures in
other ancient societies.

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,040
Socrates shows us that we
can be thoughtful and precise
in a way that allows us

40
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,730
to build a solid argument and
come to a specific conclusion.

41
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,500
But there's a catch.

42
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,540
That cost is because our thoughts
are explicit and not vague.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Our argument can be evaluated and
corrected just as precisely and we can be

44
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,510
shown where we're wrong.
On the other hand,

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,220
our thoughts can remain vague and we can
remain free of any need to argue for a

46
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,054
point,

47
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,610
but then we have no reason to think of
the right so it's shallow of us to hold

48
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,790
that a certain precise conclusion is true.

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,660
This was the mistake of the
friends Socrates like to chat with.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,490
They assume they had something figured
out but had never really thought about it

51
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,324
logically.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,190
Aristotle put this way of thinking
under his scrutiny as best he could see,

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,850
he could reduce logical thinking
to a basic set of structures.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,480
The basic structure of an argument was
for Aristotle the syllogism and it runs

55
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:50,200
something like this.
If a is B and if B is c,

56
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,280
then a his seat. You can fill in a, B,

57
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,490
and c with your own favorite terms
to see what he was getting at.

58
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,200
Here's my preference.

59
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,300
If little Russian nesting doll fits
inside medium Russian nesting doll and

60
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,200
medium Russian nesting doll fits
inside big Russian nesting doll.

61
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,550
Then little Russian nesting doll
fits inside big Russian nesting doll.

62
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,780
All men are mortal. Socrates is
a man, so Socrates is mortal.

63
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,700
It may seem basic,

64
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,730
but in all syllogism we can use to
supporting pieces of information to draw a

65
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:33,550
novel conclusion that's not
in that information already.

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,770
This conclusion gets called an inference.
Okay.

67
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,840
We've used Socrates to look at logic as
a way of tightening up our understanding

68
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,390
of a topic,
the contents of our reasoning,

69
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,310
and we've used Aristotle to view
logic as a way of structuring thoughts

70
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,210
regardless of their contents,
the form of our reasoning.

71
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,530
That's second part of logic called
formal logic has done a lot to shape the

72
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:06,591
makeup of logic over the centuries by
thinking abstractly with variables and

73
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,670
operators to connect them.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,540
Magicians have contributed to
developments in mathematics,

75
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,450
computer science and many other endeavors.

76
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,010
Rewind to that syllogism stuff.
Logically,

77
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,410
this structure is considered valid.
That should mean it always works, right?

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,770
Not so fast. Look, look,

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,620
we can fill it in with some strange stuff.

80
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,390
The conclusion doesn't actually have to
be true for us to call this structure.

81
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:40,680
Logical,
valid logic gives us true conclusions.

82
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,230
If we have true information to begin with.

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,190
Verifying the accuracy of
your content means well,

84
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,160
doing your homework on whatever
it is you're arguing about.

85
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,670
We have so many disciplines that study
specific topics rigorously and in detail.

86
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,460
Meteorologists aren't stuck imagining
the reasonable possible conclusions they

87
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,930
can come to about the weather.

88
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,620
They can use logic to come to specific
conclusions backed by their observation

89
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,430
and historians don't just think about
logically possible sequences of events in

90
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:17,900
the past, but argue for specific
chronologies based on their studies.

91
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,960
It's still logic.
It's still logical,

92
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,400
but the content is as specialized as the
tools and methods used by the experts

93
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,850
in these fields.
If you've been paying attention,

94
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:32,570
as much as I expect anyone to pay
attention to some video on the Internet,

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,960
you at least get that logic has something
to do with how we think about stuff.

96
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,490
Maybe you even gathered that it has much
more to do with the thinking about part

97
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,310
than the stuff.
Pardon?

98
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,190
Way To keep up in all this thinking.

99
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,220
Does logic describe our thought process,

100
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,230
like an objective observer might or does
it judge our reasoning telling us how

101
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:01,190
we ought to think like an
impassioned partisan wood? Well,

102
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:06,110
some hopefuls have seen logic as at
least potentially a kind of physics of

103
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:10,160
thought. It's usually treated and
defined more like an ethics of thought.

104
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,110
It doesn't dictate how we think, only
how we should think if we want to reason.

105
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:15,944
Well,

106
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,300
that doesn't make logic subjective
in the sense of ultimately just up to

107
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,230
anyone's whims.

108
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,630
It just means that since we can be
logical or illogical in our thinking,

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,450
we've got to work at it.
If we want to be logical.
