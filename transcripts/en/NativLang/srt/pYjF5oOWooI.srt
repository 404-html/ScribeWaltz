00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,530
Welcome to another video in my series on
sound changes when I'm sharing the ways

2
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:18,070
that sounds change over time
in languages I've covered,

3
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,150
sounds becoming more or less similar
and sounds getting added or deleted.

4
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,340
This time I'll highlight a few other
sound change types starting with

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,040
[inaudible],
which means that a sound is weakened,

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,890
it becomes more voiced or less restricted.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,800
This weakening often
happens adjacent to other,

8
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,830
less restricted sounds
like vowels or fricatives.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,470
The ignition is potentially a
multistep process of United sound.

10
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:49,471
Might simply go from voiceless to voice
or plosive to fricative will have fully

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,790
lineated sound disappears all together.

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,010
The Spanish stop the is limited
to a fricative the between valves,

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,430
so this word is fun analogically Dow,

14
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:07,600
those most speakers
glide past this middle,

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,150
the with even less restricted airflow.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Davos some speakers take the [inaudible]
step further by omitting the entirely

17
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,050
douse.
The path of this llanishen was voiced,

18
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:28,051
stopped to voiced fricative to
voiced approximate to nothing.

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,340
There are two main paths alumni did sound
may go down if the sound and question

20
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:39,790
goes from a stop to a fricative to an
approximate like the Spanish one did.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,620
This process of relaxing the airflow
is called opening. For instance,

22
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,100
Tuscan Italian speakers
soften co two a fricative,

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,530
so they'll scan gets pronounced Toscano

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,140
if the sound goes from voiceless to
voiced and then becomes progressively less

25
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:01,720
restricted,
it's called [inaudible].

26
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,760
We can see sooner realization if we
extend the timeline for the Spanish word

27
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,740
Davos I gave before.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
That word descends from
a Latin word that toes,

29
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,470
you can see a clear example of [inaudible]
in this progression that those two

30
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,570
dot dose to Davos to dominoes to Dallas.

31
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,830
When sounds get weaker.
Becoming more like voiced approximates,

32
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,530
we call it [inaudible].
What about sounds?

33
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,410
Getting stronger towards voiceless stops.

34
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,770
That happens too and
it's called [inaudible].

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,410
Strengthening turns a less restricted
sound like an approximate or fricative

36
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,130
into a more restricted one
like an African or a stop.

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,860
As a simple example that you sound in,

38
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,950
you is fortified to an affricate Jay in
the colloquial pronunciation did you?

39
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,630
As [inaudible].

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,460
I'm going to move on to a handful
of other sound change types.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,070
So start making a list.
Don't fear though.

42
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,640
I'll give simple explanations and
examples of each one along the way.

43
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,730
If a consonant is deleted,
but the vowel before it is length,

44
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,760
and to make up for that loss,
it's called compensatory lengthening.

45
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,400
The protal Greek word, [inaudible]
foot eventually lost. It's Duh,

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,530
but ancient Greek speakers lengthen the
vowel ow to compensate for that loss.

47
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,540
So their word for foot was bowls,
not just both.

48
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,980
Speaking of the Greeks,

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,280
if two or more sound swap places that
has a fun Greek name metathesis in the

50
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,940
nonstandard pronunciation of ask as acts,

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,540
the two consonants and Sir get switched.

52
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,423
Similarly,

53
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,490
Sardinian speakers say four bolt instead
of the expected Dato inherited from

54
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,240
Latin towed,
or

55
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,430
if one or more vowels change to become
like another valve within the same word,

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,820
it's pleasantly called vowel harmony.
Two examples here.

57
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,370
First, the easier one. Turkish
builds words by tacking on endings,

58
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,780
but the vowels in those endings harmonize
with the last val in the root word

59
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,940
that they attached to. So the
Turkish, now ev means house.

60
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,800
And the pluralist avalanche houses
where the plural ending has the matching

61
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:37,730
vowel, eh, but the plural of be
not building is be not allowed.

62
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,400
Within a second example, the vowel Ah,

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,480
in the Proto Germanic word for people
was raised and fronted to eh in men under

64
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,140
the influence of the high front
vowel in the next syllable,

65
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,890
this change towards a high front
vowel is called [inaudible].

66
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,290
In the history of the Germanic
languages like English,

67
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,380
I'll cover one more change here.

68
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,400
We looked at stress and pitch acts
and in the IPA for language learning,

69
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,330
if the way a language accent
syllables changes over time,

70
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,910
the name for that is an accent shift.

71
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,040
Early Indo European languages stress
different syllables in different words,

72
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,010
which shows up in the way
Sanskrit and Greek accent,

73
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,000
the last syllable in
it does or [inaudible],

74
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,520
but the first syllable in mythos or Mithid
Germanic languages like English have

75
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,480
fixed the stress accent
to the first syllable.

76
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,340
And this accent shift explains why the
English equivalents of those words our

77
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:43,090
father and mother both stressed
on the initial syllable.

78
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,200
In just a few short videos,

79
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,230
you've been able to arm yourself
with the range of sound change types,

80
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,690
but instead of longwinded pros,

81
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,870
can we capture the sound
changes in concise formulas?

82
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,070
The video,

83
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,670
we'll tie up this series by showing
you the most common and traditional way

84
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:05,830
linguists visualize the sound changes
that I've explored in this series.
