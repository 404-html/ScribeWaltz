00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,970
Welcome to the second
lesson in native Ling. Dot.

2
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,810
Comes course on language
change in language history.

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,130
This time around we're going to look
at the kinds of concepts we need to be

4
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:26,900
familiar with in order to evaluate whether
or not two languages are related and

5
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,720
how they're related,
how closely they're related.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,430
The first thing we need to consider is
what part of language are we going to be

7
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:34,941
looking at?

8
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:39,200
What part of a language are we going to
be comparing and through trial and error

9
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:43,250
it seems the best practice that's been
established is to look at what's known as

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:47,960
basic core vocabulary.
Basic core vocabulary is a range of words,

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,990
vocabulary items that stand for common
concepts including family members

12
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:57,110
including basic concepts that
are found in nature, animals,

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,400
pronouns,

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,230
very common everyday items that at least
in theory aren't replaced very much and

15
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:08,210
are passed down to the next generation
of speakers early and often will also

16
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:11,990
need to know what to look for when we
compare the basic core vocabulary of one

17
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:15,350
language to another.
When we look at vocabulary items,

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,270
which are just single words.

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,510
What we'll find is that when
two languages are related,

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,300
they'll share a resemblance,
a common root.

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,370
So the two vocabulary items
will ultimately derived
from the same common sorts.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,020
We use the word common to mean that
at one time they weren't the same,

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,240
but they diverged over time in different
areas, in different speech communities,

24
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,240
into distinct words in
two different languages.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,400
But suffice it to say that cognate is
just a term for saying that these two are

26
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,700
related words that come
from some common ancestor.

27
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,870
That's what we're looking for
to establish a relationship,

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,360
but that's not the only reason that two
words would look similar to words might

29
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:04,280
also look similar to each
other due to chance. In other
words, randomly over time,

30
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:08,360
especially with small words in languages,
we'll find that similar words.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,290
Similar sounding words will
stand for similar concepts,

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,370
so we might find that the word for water
and one language resembles the word in

33
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:20,690
a completely unrelated language and the
two words may not be related at all.

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,860
When one language comes into
contact with another language,

35
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:28,760
it often borrows words from that
other language. It takes words,

36
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:33,260
especially for concepts that it doesn't
already have. For example, in English,

37
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:36,260
we borrow the word cafe from French cafe.

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,420
The two words aren't genuine.

39
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,200
Cognates that developed independently
in English and French rather.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,460
English speakers at some point
borrowed the word cafe from French.

41
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,200
The same analysis helps us when we look
at the basic core vocabulary list of

42
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,600
English.
We have a word person.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,340
The word person is a fairly basic word,
yet it was actually borrowed.

44
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,100
It's a native dramatic word in
English. Well, it's a native word now,

45
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,220
but it was at some point
borrowed into English,

46
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,310
so when we find languages like Spanish,

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,600
Italian and French that
inherited this word from Latin,

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,370
we can't genuinely say, let's compare the
English cognate to the French cognate,

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,760
where the English cognate to the
Spanish cognate because at some point,

50
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,210
English borrowed that word,
whereas the other languages inherited it.

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,861
At this point,

52
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:30,430
you have some understanding of cognates
and language and an understanding of

53
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,770
similarities that will show up due
to things other than cognitive.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,530
Namely borrowing and chance.

55
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,370
Now we'll be able to move on and compare
individual languages and start to look

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,820
at family relationship.
