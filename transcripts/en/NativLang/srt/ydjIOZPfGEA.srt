1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,860
Languages change over time,
but you already know that much.

2
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,380
If you've gone through my
intro to language history,

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,420
you've seen how an individual word changes
as it passes from a protal language

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,770
interrelated daughter languages where
it transforms into distinct words called

5
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:26,604
cognates.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,230
The differences between cognates show
up most noticeably in the way the words

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,123
sound.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,510
We were able to use these differences
to spot sound correspondences that mark

9
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,490
cognates in their related languages,

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,810
but also to recognize the sound changes
that separate the daughter languages

11
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,900
from their common parent.
In this series,

12
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:50,160
we'll take a closer look at the types of
sound change that shaped the history of

13
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,450
languages and language.

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:56,451
Families all around the world foreign
and familiar like historical linguistics,

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,360
often split sound change into two halves,

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,660
regular changes versus irregular changes.

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,110
A regular sound change takes place
systematically and in every instance of an

18
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:13,170
environment. For example, if a
language undergoes a sound change,

19
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:17,680
where are becomes pronounced?
Ooh, every er will change too.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,840
If in that same language turns
into mm between a vowel and a B,

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,360
then every mm found after a val and
before a B will undergo that sound change.

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,100
Early in the 20th century,

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,110
the regularity hypothesis proposed that
all sound change naturally works this

24
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:41,970
way. Irregular sound changes
are quirky in nature.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,020
They're actually known as sporadic
sound changes because the sound change

26
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,810
doesn't occur routinely
in a given environment.

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,060
Let's take an example from English.

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,710
Some older dialects of English
pronounced the word for a male Fox,

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,740
Fox and the word for a female of the
species fixing in other dialects.

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,360
The two words started with a
VA thanks to dialect mixing.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Modern English speakers inherited a bit
of both leaving us with Fox and vixen.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,020
The change from dramatic foe to
modern English in vixen is sporadic.

33
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,600
Since it doesn't match up with
any regular across the board.

34
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,430
Sound change in modern English.

35
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,120
To understand sporadic sound change,

36
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,570
we'd really need to look into the
features of local dialects and regional

37
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,530
language patterns.

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,060
That's at least the case in the Fox
vixen example I gave where the two words

39
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:38,310
descend from two different dialects.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,790
We aren't going to attempt to uncover
the background behind that kind of sound

41
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,770
change here.
Instead,

42
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,570
the topic of regular sound change will
be the order of the day. This series,

43
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:53,040
we'll look at the various types of regular
pronunciation change that are common

44
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,480
to languages around the world,

45
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
be they foreign languages like Japanese
and Arabic or native ones like English.

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,970
We'll also see how these changes very
often make combinations of sounds easier

47
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,650
to pronounce.
In other words,

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,240
one of the key motivations for
speakers to change a sound is ease of

49
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,200
articulation.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,880
For any viewers who aren't yet familiar
with language change and reconstructed

51
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:20,170
languages, I'll leave you with
another link to that series. Also,

52
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,870
since we're going to focus on
the change part of sound change,

53
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,580
you'll need a basic understanding of
sounds. If that's where you're at.

54

first in the next video.

55
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,370
It's onto the various processes of
stem change starting with assimilation.

56
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
Thanks for watching.

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:43,980
Okay.
