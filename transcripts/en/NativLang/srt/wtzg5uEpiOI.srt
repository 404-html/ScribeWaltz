1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,930
Oh wilfy civilization
once spread across Italy,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,230
founded ancient cities and may have left
us with words like person and Rome and

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:13,590
even the alphabet. The Romans. No, no,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,513
not them.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,500
I mean an earlier people whose
language was almost lost to us almost,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,730
but not quite.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,940
Let me take you back to Egypt.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,620
In the mid 18 hundreds a European traveler
has been touring the local sites and

9
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:35,100
now he's shopping for a souvenir,
wandering the streets.

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,050
He chances upon the perfect bargain,

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,670
a sarcophagus with the mummies
still wrapped up inside.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,620
He hauls it back to Vienna and sets it
up as a creepy showpiece in his home.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,060
After his death,

14
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:52,290
it's donated to a museum
where something odd is found.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,251
The mummies,

16
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:58,170
bandages are filled with letters
and not a few letters, either.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,440
A whole book,
a puzzling book.

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,010
It wasn't Egyptian at all.
The ink red,

19
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,660
like inscriptions from Italy
made by an ancient civilization.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,960
The Romans called it
through ski or to Ski.

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,470
Today we still call their homeland Tuscany
and now here was this mummy wrapped

22
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,730
in the longest to trust. Can
text ever seen? It was precious,

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,360
but this linen book had a problem,
a problem.

24
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:30,480
It's shared with thousands of
other interest in inscriptions.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,870
The language looked nothing like any
other mysterious but not on deciphered.

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,590
These letters go from right to left,

27
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:44,220
but flip them and you'll see that
they are basically our letters.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,060
See the popular story goes that the ABC
spread from the finishings to Greece to

29
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,120
Italy where Rome inherited them.
We're missing a piece though.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,300
It was the trust skins who spread the
alphabet in Italy and it seems the Greek

31
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:04,200
alphabet they inherited had to Lenny
sounds for them it trust skins were fine

32
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,090
with voiceless patrol car,

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,740
but they didn't need the voiced
but go in an inscription.

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,800
They even wrote the word
for Greek as Craig Gay.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
This is why the Romans, when they borrowed
the alphabet, originally pronounced,

36
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,950
see as both coc and [inaudible]
looking at the Greek alphabet.

37
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,660
It should have only made the sound gum
and in my video on Latin, let her modding.

38
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,840
This is why we met a vexed Roman
who added a tail to that seed.

39
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,340
Create our letter g,

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,390
but a trust skin did make use of
sounds that might be harder for you to

41
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:38,490
distinguish.
Get your ears ready.

42
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Buh Buh [inaudible] versus
aspirated par tar car.

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,710
Like pursue mask,

44
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,740
a word that lives on right in the
heart of our English vocabulary.

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,020
Ancient reports tell us that they
were also missing the vowel ow or

46
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,930
linguistically we'd say that they
didn't distinguish. Oh from Ou.

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,960
If we the claim that Rome took
its very name from a trusting one.

48
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,390
Interesting example is the word Houma.

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,350
So this book was missing letters but
it also added letters like this curious

50
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,020
eight looking symbol earlier written
plus the Romans cut out the h and left us

51
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,670
with f.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,300
So this is a f it trusts gins also
had many letters for s sounds,

53
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,040
but only use two of them at a time.

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,670
A hint that they distinguished from.

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,570
But what do these letters mean?

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,480
The answers lie in an ancient dictionary
written by the last known speaker,

57
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,700
emperor Claudius who work was lost.

58
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,360
No dictionaries,
no grammars.

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,880
And find after find after.

60
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:56,140
Find frustratingly never uncovered
in a trust skin. Rosetta stone.

61
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,780
The experts turned to guests. Ology
pull words out of the text and guests.

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,700
Is this by chance? Indo European?
No, clearly Semitic. Wait,

63
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,500
it's like bask. No, no.

64
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:12,130
Hungarian fed up with
this circular approach.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
He trusts ecologists took a new path.

66
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,170
Don't pull words out of artifacts,

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,620
leave them in then like
a code without a key.

68
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,560
Try out combinations.
Look at each inscription in its context,

69
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,490
combined different meanings in different
contexts until you find meanings that

70
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,120
unlock every text.
It was brute force,

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,740
but slowly this at Tory
technique yielded results.

72
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,640
We caught glimpses of a real
language with real grammar.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,710
It had singular and plural
nouns. Clen, [inaudible] ice.

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I said there were case endings like
nominative a on kraken pronouns like me,

75
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,850
meaning and verb tenses tool had a
past tense two two care when covered a

76
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:06,010
language with dynamic and changing
sounds. Vowels. We're trending simpler.

77
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:11,011
Over time the hero Ajax was once Ivus
but later became ava us or gave us the

78
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:17,170
word for the gods. The highest
a trust can concern was ice it.

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,440
And later a said they used nucleic
consonants where we might expect vowels,

80
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,850
loathing or maybe faint.
Val's like utter lumper.

81
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,220
These smashed a trust can word suggest
the language under wit, a big shift.

82
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,500
Centuries into its written history,

83
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:40,501
inscription start to drop [inaudible]
after the first syllable via trust.

84
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:45,430
Skin name for themselves was once
[inaudible] but became rustler.

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,840
And in one inscription, a Latin
word gets chopped down to pressure.

86
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,270
It's a major clue that it trusts can
words started with a heavy accent on their

87
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,950
first syllable,
not cross center,

88
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,220
but Ross and comparing translations
and glosses yielded even more results.

89
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,860
Take quasi bilinguals.

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,820
These inscribed to trust can artifacts
with the Latin or Greek doppelganger.

91
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,880
My favorite are talking objects,

92
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,830
aristocratic gifts that
speak for themselves, meaning
Moolow, Veronica, Lottie,

93
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:21,260
svelte corners.
It's very quirky,

94
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,700
but it's plausible when we find out that
objects also talk like this in Latin

95
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,990
and Greek and phonetic,

96
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,540
we were even finding hints of a context
for the language itself, a language.

97
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,790
So unlike its neighbors,
uh,

98
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,791
fascinating stone from the Greek island
of Lemnos features a soldier surrounded

99
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,370
by letters and words that
really resemble a trust skin.

100
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,930
Is this a lost sister language dialect,

101
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,720
perhaps a trust in wasn't so alone?

102
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,830
Did it belong to a larger
family of two rhenium languages?

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,570
The language of that linen
book is still mysterious.

104
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,430
We don't know how this text got to Egypt,
but thanks to all this work,

105
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,370
we can tell it's a kind
of ritual calendar.

106
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,480
It's sometimes we can follow
whole threads of text.

107
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,180
Kaylee who through Mish
[inaudible] Tate streak.

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,360
It's almost like if you close your eyes,

109
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,450
I could take you right back to
the days of fluent to trust skin.

110
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,950
But ask how to say a simple yes
or no, and we're lost. Again,

111
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,460
stick around at subscribing for language.
