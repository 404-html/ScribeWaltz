1
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,230
All the basic features of romance,
Bourbon, the helping verbs.

2
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,030
You'll meet this time also.

3
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:04,820
Yeah,

4
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,290
that reflect those same basic features,
so you'll need to be familiar with them.

5
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,340
Can Be present,
indicative IBS,

6
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,850
predatory rbst or present subjunctive
IBS to throw just a few forms your way

7
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,730
with all of those endings in mind.
Take a look at to helping verbs.

8
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,800
I bet. Eh, an s setting. Why can
they act as helping verbs? Well,

9
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:33,700
they sometimes sit next to a
meaning heavy verb like Cantara,

10
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,460
but do most of the grammatical

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,393
work.

12
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,110
The main content for in this example is
in some invariable born less variable

13
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:56,160
forms.
These forms are typically nonpersonal.

14
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,490
They carry no person number
information in their ending.

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,090
You've met one of these forms already.
The infinitive light got Darren,

16
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,420
but verbs also have a past participle.
Like

17
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,500
these can be adjectives as
in vegetable can tattoo,

18
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,810
but they're also very handy and
phrases with our Beta [inaudible],

19
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,830
Jarons and present participles also exist.

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,460
Rewind to that example I
showed you with can tattoo.

21
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,720
Perfect.
What's going on here?

22
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,330
It's the same thing that
happens in English. Have some,

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,840
the main grammatical verb have isn't
the same as the main content from sun

24
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,270
in French, Italian and other
central romance languages.

25
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,830
The verb aesthetic comes into play with
verbs of motion at other verbs that

26
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:23,030
don't take direct objects. As
said, it has unexpected forms.

27
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,850
So for venue to come we find
is 22 and these languages

28
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,600
[inaudible] La Vinny

29
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,290
with [inaudible] participles describe
the person performing the action so they

30
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:53,930
have to match the number
and gender of the subject.

31
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,810
He Lou Phil You is 22 verses Isla Philia
is Venita not so with our Betty Elu

32
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,770
Phileo at he left Phelia at Kentucky

33
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,340
Iberian and Romanian languages
use Ebay with all verbs.

34
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,850
Venita included Avenida I've a neat

35
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,700
Romanian Italian romance.

36
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,730
French and Sardinian use this perfect
tense for their regular past tense instead

37
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,230
of the Predator.
It can tie,

38
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,220
which we find for example in
formal written Italian or French,

39
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,250
compare this to Spanish or Portuguese
which continue the use of Kuntai

40
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,150
colloquially.

41
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,030
It is some,
it is done.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,600
This same way of forming the passive is
founded in romance with aesthetic plus a

43
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,100
past participle Cantata scree.

44
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,760
But I meant to write script too.
It's the past participle written.

45
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,460
What do you think as scraped domains?
That's a perfect construction.

46
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,800
What about s scrape too?
That's a passive.

47
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,900
There's another very popular
romance passive that goes like this,

48
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,770
says Cribbet.
Literally it writes itself,

49
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
which we'll learn about later.

50
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,040
The help of romance,
helping verbs doesn't stop there.

51
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Modal verbs like the auxiliaries
can want to need to or ought to,

52
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,990
our mood verbs that introduce
an infinitive [inaudible].

53
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,190
Another use of auxiliaries.

54
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,680
Western romance languages
have the equivalent of Goto
before an infinitive for

55
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,050
near future events.
Much like English does

56
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,730
vacant you've vegetable tea and
one more use of helping verbs.

57
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,180
Western romance languages,
not including French.

58
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,770
Can you start it as a helping verb
with a Jaron to point out something

59
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,560
done right now.
Start Cantando

60
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,463
stumbles

61
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,790
Sardinian users s set in this same way.

62
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,410
Socket
sames contaminate

63
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,650
and I bet it get a lot of it

64
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,100
mileage and the modern languages
beyond their users. Auxiliaries.

65
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,610
I bet it is hurting many
everyday phrases like

66
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,650
as family and [inaudible]

67
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,580
a series the Copula we're linking verb
luck Cassez Manga or Eley Fiji tsunamis.

68
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,873
Okay.

69
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,550
If you've been following along so far,
I congratulate you.

70
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,450
You've made it through romance
verbs and now you're prepared.

71
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,280
Rona.
