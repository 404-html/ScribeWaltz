1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,820
This is the last lesson in the grammar
of words where we're going to explore

2
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:16,180
some of the properties that don't become
apparent until we put multiple words

3
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:19,900
together, but that are still often
reflected in the form of words.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,760
Remember that this entire time we've
been concerned with form morphology.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,860
So let's consider for properties
possession, modification, agreement,

6
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,360
and government. Let's stick with those
four for now. Starting with possession,

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,730
it has a fairly descriptive name.

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,410
You can probably guess that it tends to
deal with one down possessing another

9
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,020
now, and that's the
gist of it. In English,

10
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:48,460
we show possession by adding an apostrophe
s suffix or clinic to the Noun that

11
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:52,390
is the possessor and placing that noun
before the noun that is the possessed.

12
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:57,391
Now an example would make this
clearer John's car or the dog's bone.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,890
Both of these examples use the aloe morph
of the apostrophe s morphine to show

14
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:07,330
possession. Other languages show
possession in other ways. For instance,

15
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,790
the romance languages
used periphery assists.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,850
So does modern German in languages that
have won a genitive case is perfectly

17
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:17,830
fine for showing possession.
So for instance,

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,640
in Latin [inaudible] [inaudible]
would be the girls dog.

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,230
And in that instance we do the reverse
of English in the romance languages.

20
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,620
A pair of frosted construction
developed that replaced the old Latin

21
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:33,520
construction. So you say the
equivalent of the dog of the girl,

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,290
and basically every romance language,
let's move on to agreement.

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,721
Agreement involves,
yeah,

24
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,390
there's one word matching the
same property of another word.

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,740
That's an awkward way to say it, but let
me give you some examples. In Spanish,

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,540
a masculine noun will be described by an
adjective that takes a masculine ending.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,680
A feminine now will be described by an
adjective that takes a feminine ending.

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,400
We sum that up by saying that
the noun and the adjective agree.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,060
The adjective agrees with the Noun.
That's a case of agreement.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,140
The same thing happens in English
between subject nouns and verbs.

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,970
The word talks agrees with He.
So we would expect to say he talks,

32
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,490
but not I talks or you talks.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,540
So talks agrees with the third person,
singular subject.

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,490
That's another case of agreement.

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,710
The verb has to take a third
person singular ethics to
show that it agrees with

36
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,630
the third person singular subject.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,200
Let's distinguish
agreement from government.

38
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,550
The traditional account of government has
us look at the word that is governing.

39
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,410
In other words,
we look forward.

40
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,440
That forces another word to
comply with a certain property.

41
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,670
That's another awkward definition,
but let's move on to some examples.

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,830
In English we have prepositions if
they take a pronoun, in other words,

43
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:51,750
if they govern a pronoun like me,

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,100
we expect that the preposition is followed
by an object pronoun rather than a

45
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,200
subject. Pronouns. In other words,

46
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,050
the word accompanying the preposition
must be in the object case.

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,230
So I would say for me, but not
for he. I instead say for him,

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,550
I don't use the subject case Pronoun
after the preposition for or any

49
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:15,460
preposition for that manner.
I use the object case,

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,290
so we say that prepositions
English governed the
accusative case of pronouns or

51
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,390
the object case of pronouns.

52
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,130
It's very important to notice the
government applies to verbs as well.

53
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,800
If I say I saw him.
The verb.

54
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,390
See here in the past tense saw prompts
us to use an object case pronoun him

55
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:39,370
rather than another subject case Pronoun.
That's another example of government.

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,260
Contrast this with agreement.
Agreement matches a property equally well.

57
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,740
Government pushes a word to have a
property that the other word doesn't have.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,160
Now let's talk about modification.
When an optional word is added,

59
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,030
that changes the meaning of another word.
It modifies that other word,

60
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,630
adjectives and adverbs are the
main modifiers. In English,

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,430
we have an example like the gray cat
ate dinner in which gray is an adjective

62
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,000
that modifies cat.
You can see that if we remove gray,

63
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:14,550
the cat's still makes sense.
Adverbs work similarly.

64
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,610
For instance,
if I say the rabbit runs swiftly,

65
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,590
swiftly modifies how the rabbit runs,
we could just say that the rapid runs,

66
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,670
the extra material isn't necessary,
but it does add something.

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,080
It modifies the action.

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,850
Notice that these properties start to
push us away from looking at the form of

69
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,490
words. We're already talking
about the arrangement,

70
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,500
the order of words and sentences,

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,520
and with that you're ready to move
on to the grammar of sentences.

72
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm glad you stuck with me throughout
this series and thank you for learning.

73
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,310
I am.
