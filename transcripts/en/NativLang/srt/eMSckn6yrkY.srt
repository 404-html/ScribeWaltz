1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,160
I'm going to give you an idea of what
a grammatical rule is by helping you to

2
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:15,700
formulate a rule to explain it.
Grammatical feature of English.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,620
Before we do this,

4
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:21,490
I should bring up two more symbols
that some linguists use when analyzing

5
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:26,080
sentences. We've already seen
brackets which can enclose phrases,

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,640
another symbol as the asterisk which is
placed before sentences that are judged

7
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:35,080
not to be examples of a language
and another is the question mark,

8
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:38,980
but just placed before sentences
that are judged as questionable.

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,980
In the last lesson we saw that English
speakers tend to use subject verb, object,

10
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:49,120
word order in a statement like
you were there, but verb subject,

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,260
object ordering questions with
the verb be like were you there?

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,720
Let's come up with a way to describe how
English speakers ask questions with the

13
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:03,721
word be and sometimes with have compared
to the declarative sentence he has done

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:09,481
the work to has he done the work in both
examples it looks like the verb and the

15
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:14,530
subject invert the subject and the verb
seem to switch places when you ask a

16
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,364
question.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,720
So let's try and formulate a rule using
the concept of inversion to describe the

18
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:24,670
situation in English and see how well
it applies English speakers in for the

19
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:29,671
noun phrase of the subject and the verb
to ask a question that works fine for

20
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:34,270
the example. Are you there? But how
well does it explain the second example,

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,520
has he done the work?
In that case,

22
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:41,500
our main verb is actually an auxiliary
with the past participle. It's as done,

23
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,920
but the whole phrase has done,
doesn't switch,

24
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:49,921
doesn't invert with the subject only the
verb has does so we don't find that we

25
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:53,980
ask has done he the work we asked,
has he done the work?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,300
We realized that we don't
move the whole verb phrase.

27
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,010
We actually extract a verb from it's
verb phrase and place it before the

28
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:03,521
subject.

29
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:08,380
Now it doesn't look like we're inverting
anything because the subject now and

30
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:10,690
doesn't end up inside the verb phrase.

31
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,250
Instead it looks like we're actually
just extracting that one head verb and

32
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,460
moving it before the,
now with that in mind,

33
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,580
let's formulate a new rule
to describe the situation.

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,440
Let's say English speakers extract the
head verb from it's verb phrase and move

35
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,050
it before the subject.
Now to ask a question.

36
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,000
Now we have a descriptive rule that
seems to work for both of the examples we

37
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,834
have at hand.

38
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,210
So we're going to change our rural
slightly to produce similar sentences,

39
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,230
but the slight change we're making
is a move toward imperative logic.

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,940
Extract a verb from it's verb phrase
and move it before the subject.

41
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:53,290
Now this gives us a set of instructions
that if applied to the declarative

42
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,230
sentence produces the
question as it's output.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,640
This be have asking rule will work pretty
well until we get to an example like

44
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,040
he will have done the work on Friday,

45
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,170
we'd expect will he have done the
work on Friday? But we get have,

46
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:16,120
he will done the work on Friday. These
rules are a work in progress. Then

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,000
I hope you now have a handle on the
basics of the grammar sentences and thank

48
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,050
you for learning with me.
