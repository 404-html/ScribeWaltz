1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
[inaudible].

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,710
Here's the language and heres a brain,

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,330
and this is a brain on language.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,010
Just look at this brain in case you're
not up to date on all the sites.

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,180
There's a whole lot going on here.
There are neurons and glial cells,

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,920
capillaries and myelinated axons.
All this anatomy,

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,460
but the sexiest stuff to focus on has
been the nerve cells in your cerebral

8
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:45,520
cortex.
That's this outside layer here.

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,480
The inside looks whitish.
This stuff looks gray.

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,450
Hence the terms of white
matter and gray matter.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,040
The first real evidence of the brain's
role in language came not from observing

12
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,300
normal healthy brains using
language but from damaged brains.

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,640
This started back in the 18 hundreds
when pioneering researchers dissected the

14
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:12,700
brains of a phase JAKKS.
The ancient Greek word, uh,

15
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:17,701
pasea simply means speechlessness
patients suffering from Aphasia have head

16
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:22,240
injuries that disrupt their abilities
to understand or produce speech.

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,750
It turns out that specific linguistic
difficulties were associated with lesions

18
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:31,150
in specific parts of the cortex.

19
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,950
The logic involved in pinning down these
language centers of the brain is pretty

20
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:39,244
simple.

21
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,450
If someone doing action a
has a healthy region be,

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,900
but someone else who has
damaged to region B can't do a,

23
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,870
then it looks like region B
is necessary for action. A

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,700
in 1861 of French surgeon named Bull
Balka began to study the brains of a phase

25
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:06,160
yaks and hunted down just such a region,

26
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,380
apparently crucial for speech production.

27
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,070
A region we today called Broca's
area inspired by broke his findings,

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,670
a German doctor,
an anatomist Carl van Nica,

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,220
went and found another such region.

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,990
This one linked to linguistic
understanding, as you might've guessed,

31
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,340
that region is called Venegas area.
A little side note for you,

32
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,800
anatomy buffs or anyone
looking for extra credit.

33
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,960
Today's most widely used
system for cutting the brain
into regions was proposed

34
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,290
by another German
anatomist Corbion Broadman.

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,780
This outer surface of the brain we've
been admiring has over two dozen of these

36
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,150
Broadman area's brokers,

37
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,170
corresponds to Broadman area's 45 and 44
well 22 his home to Veronica's area in

38
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:57,880
your brain specifically.

39
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,840
Both of these are most likely
in your left hemisphere

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,020
with all of the technological leaps
forward we've made in brain imaging since

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,430
broke his day looking inside the brain
to see what's lighting up where has

42
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,590
obviously become even more important,

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,860
but don't let the Uffizi acts mislead you.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,170
What we're searching for inside the
brain isn't necessarily straight forward.

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,480
The way researchers speak about it,

46
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,510
it's not as if neuroimaging gives us
the exact brain location of language or

47
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,540
have love or any other human concept.

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,620
Instead we get to see
the areas of the brain,

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,700
the activation of the actual brain cells
that are involved in performing a task.

50
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,181
These days.

51
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:51,181
There are two fields that tackle our topic
of the day where teachers language on

52
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,030
a burn, and Chris, you've
already forgotten the first one.

53
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,530
Neuro linguistics makes an
entire discipline out of
the kind of research we've

54
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:04,120
been chatting about
cycle linguistics or related field,

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,760
as the name implies is
crazy about language,

56
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,060
but it takes on general questions like
how do humans acquire language and how do

57
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:17,491
humans speak and understand with a
focus on the role of the mind in these

58
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,610
activities.
The two fields inform each other,

59
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,700
meaning that there's a high degree of
interdisciplinarity here with all this

60
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:31,480
stuff about the brain
going through your brain.

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Think for a minute about two 20th century
models of language in model number

62
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:38,950
one,

63
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,810
human language is a collection of
behaviors that are conditioned by external

64
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:46,150
stimuli.
Verbal behavior,

65
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,540
language that gets a favorable response
will be reinforced and repeated.

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
This is a perspective called behaviorism
and it places the brain in a background

67
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,264
role.

68
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,610
Model number two is a very popular
linguistic model of language known as

69
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,510
nativism.

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,710
It holds that language is
an innate mental faculty.

71
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,740
Grammar isn't just a
linguistic concept anymore.

72
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,460
It's actually born into
every healthy human brain,

73
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,450
but instead of marginalizing the brain
by focusing on external behavior and

74
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,710
operant conditioning,

75
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,340
and instead of bringing linguistics to
the brain by mapping grammatical concepts

76
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,640
onto brain areas,

77
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,630
perhaps we could be a little more
considerate of what the brain is actually

78
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:38,680
doing. When we articulate our
understanding of language. Yes.

79
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,681
Being that specific with our familiar
general academic terms will require a bit

80
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,550
more intellectual muscle than ignoring
the brain or slapping stickers like

81
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,750
language, grammar, speech on
to some part of your cortex,

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,160
but consider it an invitation,
an invitation.

83
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Get to know your brain and your
brain on language a bit better.

84
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,950
Thanks for learning with me.
