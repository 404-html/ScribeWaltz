1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,383
Okay.

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,180
The first video of the series
presented logic as a language,

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,260
a formal language that can help us think
about human language and individual

4
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:22,094
languages.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,210
Now that we've seen why it's useful to
have a logic that's a formal system with

6
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:28,490
constant symbols at variable symbols.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,630
I want to explore the parts of statements
and the constants and variables you

8
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,720
use to represent those parts.
Small parts of statements in logic,

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,580
so we'll start by dividing all statements
we could make into subjects and

10
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:41,414
predicates.

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,400
So far I presented words and statements
as symbols and used even simpler

12
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:50,690
alphabetic symbols to stand for
those words and statements like x,

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,810
n p.
Now in our symbols,

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,260
names something or focused on a
topic they're called subjects.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,210
All of the individual constants we've
used so far like h for house and he for

16
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,910
the English language
can be used as subjects,

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,650
but subjects are part of a larger frame.
The frame includes the predicate,

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,260
which relates information
about the subject or subjects.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,800
If you went through my intro
to the verb in its arguments,

20
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,090
especially the first two videos on
arguments and valence. See you've have,

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,330
you've got a linguistic perspective
on subjects and predicates.

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,100
You saw that verbs, take
arguments, send the Bourbon.

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,190
It's arguments from the
core of a sentence frame,

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,460
but you don't need to be a linguist to
get a feel for the difference between

25
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:34,790
subjects and predicates and you don't
need to take it all the way back to

26
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,890
Aristotle's heavy discussion on the topic.

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,410
You just need to consider
the two terms in relation.

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,730
The rough idea is that a subject
is a term that a predicates said.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,870
Something about at a predicate is a term
that says something about a subject.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,450
Let's look at those predicates. If a
predicate says something about a subject,

31
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:56,330
it makes sense that a predicate
does not include the subject.

32
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,730
Some examples of predicates are
is red is a language or sees.

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,570
Let's simplify these predicates
by using constant symbols.

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,790
Unlike a variables x,

35
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:12,080
Y and Z and individual
constants like h and e,

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,370
the symbols for predicates or capital
letters using capital letters for

37
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:20,180
predicate Constance is a convention and
logic so the predicates send up looking

38
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,510
like this.
Our first two predicates.

39
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,390
Say something about a single subject.
For example,

40
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,940
we could say that English is a language.

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,030
Then we could write English
is a language in logic.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,090
That third predicate
has multiple arguments.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,390
We could say John Sees Mary or Jill sees
the movie and we'll write the sentence

44
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,440
in symbolic logic like this.

45
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,950
Notice that the predicate comes first.

46
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,510
This is true when the predicate constant
is the predicate of a single individual

47
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,180
or when it's the predicate
of multiple individuals.

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,580
Notice that we used constants for a
predicates and that holds true for all

49
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,960
predicates and basic logic,

50
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,590
but let's scrap our individual constants
for a moment and speak a bit more

51
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,190
generally about using
variables with our predicates.

52
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,760
Instead of speaking specifically
about English as a language,

53
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:17,350
we might want to find out whether or not
something is a language. In this case,

54
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:22,120
we'll use x to stand for that.
Something I mentioned in the last lesson,

55
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,190
but it's worth repeating
for clarity's sake,

56
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:29,191
that that variable x can be filled by
many values but it doesn't stand for any

57
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,490
specific value.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,260
A fancy way of saying this is a variable
ranges over the domain of discourse

59
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,130
where the domain or the universe of
discourse is just a set of everything that

60
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,480
the variable can represent.

61
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,380
So when it comes to is a
language you can think of.

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,470
This combination of predicate and variable
as blank is a language and this one

63
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:55,000
as blank is running at this one.
As you guessed it,

64
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,290
blank sees Blake more precisely.
Blank sees some other Blake.

65
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,170
Of course,
if you have strong analytic skills,

66
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,450
you can always think in terms
of the variables. Instead,

67
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,451
x is a language x is running at x
sees why with variables in mind.

68
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,090
Let's look at the valence.
See of our predicates.

69
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,830
This refers to the number
of terms that are predicate.

70
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:20,020
Says something about the predicate
is a language at is running.

71
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,490
Say something about one term which
we can symbolize with the variable x.

72
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,050
So they have a valence of one.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,130
The predicates sees on the other
hand leaves two slots open for us,

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,000
one for x and another for a y.
So it has a valence of too,

75
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,890
but let's not stop there.

76
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:40,891
The deceptively short predicate gave has
a place for a giver x a thing given why

77
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,940
and they give ie or recipient z.
So the valence is three.

78
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,530
We can even turn to these
variables themselves, x, Y and Z,

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,110
and view them as terms with zero valence.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,320
If you're familiar with
mathematics or computer science,

81
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:00,610
you'll see similarities between these
concepts and the concepts of function and

82
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,800
argument or sub routines and parameters.

83
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,880
The specialized applications of those
terms have been refined from logic.

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,710
Now let's back up for a moment.

85
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,430
Consider something I mentioned
in the first logic video.

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,740
Whole logical statements maybe
represented just by the symbols p and Q.

87
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,720
This gives you options.

88
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,110
You won't always need to drill down
to the level of individual predicates.

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,250
And this may even be a better option if
you're evaluating statements as a whole.

90
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,260
Okay. Now you've gotten a bit of a handle
on subjects and predicates and logic.

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,920
So here's some ordinary language
statements to translate it into London.

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,513
Yes.

93
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,130
So you've seen the simplest and
stand for words and statements.

94
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
You understand constants and variables,

95
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,470
and now you know something
about subjects and predicates,

96
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,540
but this is all amateur stuff.

97
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,300
It's time to move on and look at
quantifiers and bound variables,

98
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,250
which will really tighten
up your logical statement.
