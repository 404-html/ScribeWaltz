1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,630
Riding. Listen, always faceless
lines and abstract symmetry.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,440
Originally it was a bunch of pictures.
Come see how it all started.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,740
It's 17,000 years ago.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,050
It's cold out and getting colder.
Possibly dangerous too.

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,520
This may be France and this
may be the history of writing,

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,850
but there's nothing for you here until
you take shelter in a nearby cave and see

7
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:38,450
how creative some of your ancestors
really were drawing on their enlarging

8
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:42,170
brains and a long prehistory of
building evermore complex tools.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,800
These early artists took to etching
and painting beautiful visual

10
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:49,460
representations of the animals
around them. These aren't words,

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,030
they're not stories.
They're pictures. Early.

12
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:55,370
Pictures like these start
to become very routine,

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,780
not necessarily depicting the world,
but marking and standing for things.

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,890
A place to hunt,
a place to eat.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,300
These are pictographs.
The story gets sketchy here,

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,080
but it's important to notice
that pictographic symbols
like these Petroglyphs,

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,350
rock carvings weren't words.
They weren't language,

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,160
but they became more than personal
and communal artistic expressions.

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,380
They became regular and repeatable,

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,100
possibly mapping to specific things
and for that these pictographs earned

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,940
themselves.
The fancy label of Prodo riding.

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,330
Many pictographs have an
intuitive giveaway quality.

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,400
They look like drawings of the things
they represent. Draw me a human easy.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,600
Draw me a horse. Sure.
A river. There it is,

25
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,760
but how do you clearly and simply draw
less tangible ideas like playing around

26
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:50,420
or taking it easy or don't
even think about it. Uh Oh,

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,810
watch out for this major moments in
the history of writing meet metonymy.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,770
This principled fellow lets you represent
a general nebulous idea with the

29
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:05,771
related pictogram or part of a pictogram
or a pictogram combo that's pretty

30
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:10,580
specific and obvious. Ancient stick
human is a regular old pictogram.

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,680
If you cut off sticks legs,

32
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,820
you can get across the general
idea of what walking, removing.

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,050
What about a man leaning against a tree?
What's the idea here?

34
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,130
Taking it easy. Resting.
These are idiot graphs,

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,940
symbols for ideas and concepts.
In some sense.

36
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,450
All of these drawings express ideas.
The concept of a horse,

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,860
the concept of a human,

38
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,960
so they're all idiographic but with a
little imagination and a lot of time

39
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,490
extended idiot graphs that you've cut
and combined basic pictographs to be far

40
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,110
more expressive and abstract.

41
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,220
Just when you're ready to grab that
Chisel and get your pictographic and

42
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:53,270
idiographic carving on someone more
inventive than you comes along.

43
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,980
Your pictures and ideas aren't enough
for her. Gone are the old cave days,

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,190
the world outside changing and
she needs words, words. My friend.
