1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,313
Watching.

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,200
We use the word logic and words derived
from that same Greek root logo center a

3
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,100
variety of ways.

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,210
You've probably said that someone was
being illogical because they were too

5
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:24,980
emotional or didn't agree with you.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,360
You might've thought of logic as a way
of proving things or reasoning better.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,040
I plan to dig a little deeper and talk
about logic is one basic way to approach

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,350
our use of language.
For starters,

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,280
that means I'd like to distinguish
between logic as a way of talking about

10
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:40,821
thinking,

11
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:45,821
especially reasoning and truth and logic
as a way of talking about language and

12
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,690
what goes into using language.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,830
I don't mean to propose this division
as a hard and exception list rule,

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,260
but however you plan to use logic.

15
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,450
As long as you're communicating
with other humans,

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,110
you're basic starting point will be
logic as a way to analyze language,

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,920
but since the systems we
use to communicate analysis
are themselves languages,

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,120
that means we'll have to consider logic
itself as a language. This short series,

19
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,880
we'll introduce logic as a language.
More specifically,

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,240
I'll present logic as a formal language,
a formal,

21
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,020
not because it's more polite but because
it focuses on form instead of meaning

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,010
before getting into the basics.
Consider what I,

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,650
I will and will not cover in this series.
Um,

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,500
you will get to consider
logic as a language.

25
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,530
See how to translate into that language
and look at symbolic logic as a kind of

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,990
backbone model for the fuller
statements made in everyday language.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,110
I won't spend time analyzing good or bad
arguments, you know, syllogisms informal,

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,870
informal fallacies and the like.
Um,

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,780
I won't discuss inductive
versus deductive reasoning. Uh,

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,530
and we'll consider admittedly
important questions like,

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,020
does logic underlie both
language in reality,

32
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,310
one of the various types of logics and
how do they relate to or differ from each

33
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:06,311
other or apply the logic of the language
of logic to any particular field.

34
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,800
On with the basics, I threw the
terms logic and language out at you.

35
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,060
I know those are abstract terms,
but think about learning a new language,

36
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,190
a language spoken in some foreign country.

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,310
If you reflect for a moment on
the components of that language,

38
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,730
you'll have to take on new sounds,
new parts of words,

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,190
the specific words used in that language,

40
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,150
the meaning of those new words and the
rules for constructing well-formed to

41
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,530
phrases and sentences.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,850
One way to simplify all of this is
by trying to find some core concept.

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,510
We might imagine that speakers use
language to convey things to listeners.

44
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,760
For example,
when I tell you about a house,

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,250
you might think of something
very much like this,

46
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,940
so the word house acts
as a symbol for this.

47
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,070
Here we took words as our core concept
and said that words are symbols,

48
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,920
but it looks like words
aren't just symbols.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,770
They're fixed symbols with
specific definitions. When
you parse the word house,

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,640
you related the word to a single concept.
The word house.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,510
At other words act like
constant symbols or constants.

52
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,730
One key feature of these constants like
House dog and blue is that they have

53
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,130
semantic value there.
They're meaningful.

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,830
These meaningful constants,

55
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,270
constants can relate to one another
and a variety of ways to broaden basic

56
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,030
relationships.
Our intention and extension.

57
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,080
Intention refers to what a word connotes.

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,370
Other words commonly associated with
that word or other words that are

59
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,690
properties of that word.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,880
This connotes house red and so on.

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,350
Extension is what a word denotes
it's definition or it's examples.

62
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,860
For example,
house extends to this.

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,600
Of course,
we don't just speak in single words.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,080
We also make statements like the
houses red or fish can swim and those

65
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:09,790
statements are meaningful so we
would consider those symbols to.

66
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,530
So far it follows at those statements
would also work like Constance,

67
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,460
but now we're taking on so many symbols,
all kinds of things,

68
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:22,390
all kinds of sentences. We can say
about things. All of these are symbols.

69
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,680
It would be hard to count all of them,
let alone, let alone analyze all of them.

70
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,910
What if we could strip language
down to just the symbols?

71
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,190
That's the aim of symbolic logic.

72
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,850
We want a set of symbols that helps
us evaluate structure without getting

73
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:40,690
tethered in the meaning and the use.
We may still want constants,

74
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,270
but we'll definitely need symbols that
aren't so fixed since their meanings

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,090
wouldn't be fixed. These symbols would
vary, so they're called variables.

76
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,590
To make it easy on ourselves, we'll use
very simple symbols for variables like x.

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,280
We can use these variables for words.
This x can mean a house,

78
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,770
but it's not limited to that value.
It might mean a dog.

79
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:01,960
It might also represent
an entire statement.

80
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,540
This house is red or I'm speaking English.

81
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,980
These symbols will help with strip are
our language down and take a good look at

82
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:13,570
the structure. For variables. I
can use symbols like x, Y, andZ ,

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,310
four statements with some truth
value. It's common to use p. And Q.

84
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,480
These are all conventions.
Of course, in concrete cases,

85
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,840
you will want to use a symbol that helps
you make sense of the logical form,

86
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,190
say e,

87
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,570
when you're exclusively reading he
as the English language or English.

88
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,651
In this case,

89
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:36,760
you're using that symbol as an individual
constant and name with a specific

90
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,350
interpretation. Well, that's
background for the upcoming videos.

91
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,140
In the next lesson,
I'll talk about subjects and predicates.

92
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,740
I'll also use variables and constants
to take a look at the logic behind some

93
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,230
normal language sentences
using formal logic.
