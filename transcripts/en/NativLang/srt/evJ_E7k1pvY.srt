1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,490
Languages change over time,
but to some evolve faster than others.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,810
Let's say you fall into a coma, hearing
your language spoken all around you,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,650
you snap awake in the same place,
but at a different time.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,280
They're still speaking your language,
but you can't understand a word.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,620
How long were you out?

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,490
We'll try to answer that
question in the next two videos.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,000
Starting this time with the
speed of language change.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,560
[inaudible] ha ha.
No.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,250
[inaudible] the name of a
language in Queensland, Australia,

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,840
a very quirky language.

11
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,530
First brought to our attention at the
turn of the 19 hundreds and full of so

12
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,670
many unexpected features that the grammar
written about it or in the status of a

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,210
linguistic epic.
Thanks to this book.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,170
Even from my first linguistics class,
I heard fantastic tales of dribbles,

15
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:59,490
fascinating features,
features like it has four genders,

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,350
human males and animals,

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,800
human females and fire and
water and harmful things,

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,490
edible things and other
or inanimate objects.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,180
It has incredibly free word
order to the uninitiated.

20
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:15,390
Dribble sentences might seem
about as organized as word soup.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,740
The people than jitterbug them
have a no vagueness policy.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,270
They couldn't save vaguely. She made me
laugh. They'd have to be more specific.

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,480
She told a joke and I laughed.
She tripped and I laughed.

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,410
She tickled me and I laughed
and in this language,

25
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,720
there's not even a
general word for language.

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,040
If that's not enough to tickle you
consider my favorite of durables.

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,090
Eccentricities.

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,860
A woman had to speak very differently in
earshot of her father in law and a man

29
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:47,090
around his mother-in-law.
They called this jungly.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,520
It had the same grammar as normal speech,
Google,

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,200
but the content words were switched out
to avoid offense Joe when we came in

32
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,660
handy and other complex social situations,

33
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,050
but it always involved speaking with
completely different vocabulary.

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,540
It sounds extreme,
but it happened.

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,340
Jibo was so peculiar and so influential
that linguists have even gone as far as

36
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,290
to say that without Dixon's grammar,

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,190
our understanding of the world's
language diversity would be much poorer.

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,390
Something odd happened when linguists
returned to study the language just

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,380
decades later. Traditional Jubal was
mostly a memory. A new durable young,

40
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:28,980
durable had taken over.
The class system had been reworked.

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,020
Word order was no fixed with basic
subject verb object sentences,

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,050
just like English.

43
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,580
The mother-in-law language
had been appended some
everyday words were being used

44
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:41,400
in new ways and others were
being forgotten for good.

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,690
Where we watching durable
dismantle itself in front of us.

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,620
Can the core features of a
language really evolve this fast?

47
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,700
What is the speed of language change
and how could we even measure it?

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,880
Well,
ask Morris Swatis.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,270
He's the first person I know of who laid
out a method for calculating the rate

50
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,410
of language change.

51
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,610
He developed a one size fits all solution
he swore would work for every language

52
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,444
around the world,

53
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,570
from Norway all the way to the
northern rain forest of Australia.

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,100
Take a list of words, basic words
that kids learn at an early age,

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,390
the kind that ideally don't get replaced
very much from generation to generation.

56
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,140
Compare it to the same list of
words and a descendant language.

57
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,920
What you should find is that some
words that had been replaced,

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,650
but many are still essentially
the same word. Sure.

59
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:34,450
Some sounds will get tweaked and it may
take an expert's eye to recognize their

60
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,790
sameness. So Dixon tells us that
the jury will word for dog is good,

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,580
but when he documented a
neighboring language and Bob them,

62
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,740
they told him their word
for dog, his dog. Seriously,

63
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,370
nothing to do with English though.
It's a coincidence.

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,960
It turns out that this word is
cognitive with Gouda for Swat Ish.

65
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,660
That counts as a retention.
On the other hand,

66
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,240
water is [inaudible] in all dribble
dialects except one where it's gone.

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,650
This counts as a change once you know
the proportion of retained words.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,970
Next comes the fun part. Gelatto
chronology, timing. Tongues.

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,650
Swatis thought that basic vocabulary
works like radioactive decay,

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,880
meaning that all languages replace words
at a constant rate over long periods,

71
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,510
and he felt vindicated when he checked
his assumption against history.

72
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,350
Say the time it actually took from Latin
to turn into the romance languages.

73
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,770
The method look solid.
After a thousand years,

74
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:37,120
a language keeps 86% of the
100 words on Swat issues list.

75
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,950
It's an amazing thought.

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,120
Just looking at a list of words in a
language he could calculate how old it is

77
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,070
and how far it is from its relatives.

78
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,680
He could even construct
a lexical chronometer.

79
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,170
That's the nerdiest
thing I've said all day,

80
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,760
but it predicts how long it takes to hit
major vocabulary milestones and end up

81
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,410
with a brand new language.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Remember our hypothetical
coma patient you have,

83
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:03,880
there'll be waiting a long time before
Jubril changes into a new language,

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,830
another 900 years. Because
languages change at a constant rate,

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,610
except they don't come back next time to
see why not and learn a bit more about

86
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:18,010
Australia's languages as we ask.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,140
How long can a language last before it
becomes unrecognizable? That's right.

88
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:27,420
A two parter because this is
too interesting and because
my drawing hand needs a

89
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:31,180
rest, so stick around and
subscribe for language.
