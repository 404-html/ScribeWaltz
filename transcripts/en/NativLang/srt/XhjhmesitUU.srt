1
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,130
Last time we looked at basic sentences
and Volcker, Latin and romance.

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Simple sentences have one finite for
which means a verb with person number

3
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:54,970
endings.

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,240
These contrast with non finite forums
like this infinitive in romance grammar.

5
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,660
A clause is a chunk of language
revolving around one finite contests.

6
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,960
VKC Library,
Tata [inaudible] case.

7
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,690
These are all clauses that you've seen

8
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,720
became,
they say deacon quote,

9
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,930
they say that God does Bna.
You sing well,

10
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,310
he can quote contest Beignet Dean kick,

11
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,090
Qantas Bang [inaudible] Bay.

12
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,010
These could Sean to be for,
they say that you sing well,

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,430
the mood of the second Ferb contrariness.

14
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,940
This example will be subjunctive
instead of indicative.

15
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,360
If the first verb has a whiff
of the counter factual about it.

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,450
[inaudible] I want that you sing where
you may or may not sing verses suck of

17
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,623
contests.

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I know that you sing where
you are definitely singing
Romania and uses the word

19
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,390
sunk to connect the two finite verbs
and the verb after sa is always

20
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:22,100
subjunctive.
CouldN'ta she sings Fidel.

21
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,280
I want video.
Second day,

22
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,400
literally I want that she sings.

23
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Notice the structure of sentences like
I want that you sing in romance in

24
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,130
English.

25
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,720
This is normally I want you to
sing with an infinitive to sing.

26
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,910
Why the difference? The subjects
of the two verbs are different.

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,800
Echo volume.
I want to contests you sing,

28
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,030
so they're attached with
quotes or romance, quay or key,

29
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,670
but this verbs in the subjunctive
there that gives us the right sentence

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,320
when the subjects of the two verbs
are the same like Eggo volume and echo

31
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,700
Canton. The second one's
left as an infinitive. Hey,

32
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,380
go Vallejo cantata and not ego volume.
Oakwood Eiko Canto.

33
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,650
So boy, you can tag your
Schulty where you can diary.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,470
That's the difference between what
to sing and want that somebody sing.

35
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,260
But this isn't true of Romanian where
two verbs with the same subject can still

36
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,910
join [inaudible].
I want [inaudible],

37
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,790
which literally means I want that I sing

38
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,510
modal verbs are normally found before
an infinitive with this finite plus

39
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,410
infinitive structure.
Most [inaudible],

40
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,130
they'd be oak and Tati

41
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,340
classical Latin had
passive endings for verbs.

42
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,830
Contact sings.
But it is some,

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,560
those passive endings didn't survive.

44
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,250
But that doesn't mean the
modern languages avoid passives.

45
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,280
They've created other ways
of expressing the same thing.

46
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,930
Here's the one we've seen.
If you recall as said,

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,090
a with a past participle
is to Cantata Tato.

48
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
Yeah,

49
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,860
as script too.

50
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,320
Ilulissat Lewis script too.

51
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,990
Extremely common in romance is the use
of reflexive say with third person verbs.

52
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,900
Contact. Well, you know what that
means by now, sick. Untapped.

53
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,460
Literally it sings itself for it is some

54
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,440
scary bit.
Say Scream.

55
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,300
It literally it writes
itself for it is written.

56
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,100
The verbs number singular or plural
matches the number of the subject.

57
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,310
[inaudible] Cribbet the book is written.

58
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,470
He loves Libra, SIS, grievant.

59
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,200
The books are written this passive
with say this heard across the romance

60
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,790
speaking world from Romania to Portugal.

61
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,730
A few languages have generic third
person pronouns that can approximate a

62
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,120
passive French on Shaunte.

63
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Romance in Santa Cleaver.

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,390
French leans heavily on this
way of forming the passive.

65
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,030
We've run through a range of sentence
types to give you a feel for romance

66
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:13,980
syntax. We've now seen the basics
of how nouns, verbs, pronouns,

67
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,490
adjectives, adverbs, and
sentences work in vulgar,

68
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:22,170
Latin and the romance languages. Thank
you for taking the time to learn with me.
