00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,520
Here's a quick introduction to an
ongoing controversy about the operational

2
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,140
definition of language.

3
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,590
We'll get down to it by
asking two simple questions.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,780
Where's language located and where
does language come from? Biology,

5
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:29,980
genetics, psychology, neurology,
artificial intelligence, anthropology,

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,010
and so many other fields have
contributed to this debate.

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,880
Great minds of even hung their hat
on one particular answer to those two

8
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:41,410
questions. In the abstract, they
have offered two main answers.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,410
The first is linguistic nativism,

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,950
which holds that the basics of
language and grammar are innate.

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,550
This is the nature or
the internal perspective.

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,110
If things are innate, they're built
into every human being at birth.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,650
It follows that for nativists
the origin of language.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,160
It is rooted in the history and
development of the biological organism,

15
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:05,230
which contains the language instinct.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,690
They point to a parent
linguistic universals shared
by all humans as evidence

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,600
for them.
Language is in the genes.

18
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,430
The second perspective
is linguistic empiricism.

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,750
Empiricists think that
language is entirely learned.

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,260
This is the nurturer or
the external perspective.

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,480
If language and grammar are learned,

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,420
they are features of the
organism's environment.

23
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,220
Empiricists point out that
we lack evidence for language
specific adaptations in

24
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,090
human biology and that all known features
of language match features of other

25
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:44,320
cultural developments. For them,
language is a cultural artifact.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,320
Other options abound.
For instance,

27
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:51,460
some cognitive psychologists think that
the brain has essential equipment for

28
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,330
making sense of grammar against
the strong empiricists assertion.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,740
Even if this equipment contains no
linguistic information like grammatical

30
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:04,450
categories or frameworks for pronunciation
against the strong nativist assertion.

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,800
These perspectives influenced the way
their proponents collect and evaluate

32
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,350
linguistic data,
linguistic data,

33
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,320
our sounds and text gathered
in specific languages.

34
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,210
In order to study those languages,

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,070
nativists are likely to think that
since people are born with a universal

36
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:26,310
grammar, we all have an
intuitive grammatical sense.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,150
Speakers can judge a grammatical
sentence from an ungrammatical one.

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,250
For the typical nativists you check if
a sentence is grammatical by asking a

39
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:40,251
native speaker against this empiricists
charge that actual use and not intuition

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,930
determines which sentences occur in
which do not in a given language.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,810
For the average empiricist,

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,840
you check your sentence against a
corpus containing many examples of the

43
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:55,080
language you're asking about.
The more frequent it's appearance,

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,760
the more likely the sentence.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,273
Okay.

47
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,210
The topics in my linguistics lessons
for language learners series start from

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,060
less controversial claims.
First,

49
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,440
the human body makes noises through the
air and marks on the page that other

50
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,440
humans recognize as language.
Second,

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,810
a variety of languages have been used
in a variety of ways and in a variety of

52
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,610
societies.
Throughout human history,

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,210
we observe difference or
change over time and space,

54
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,360
concrete observations of people using
language ground abstractions made based on

55
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,190
that data and not the other way around.

56
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,500
I hope you've gained some
understanding of this Meta issue.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,150
It will allow you to
appreciate the tension between
variations and universals in

58
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:45,950
any discussion about human language.
