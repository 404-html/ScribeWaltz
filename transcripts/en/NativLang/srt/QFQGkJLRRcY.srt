1
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,353
Hey

2
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,190
in the videos on Bulger Latin and romance.

3
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,200
Now you learned about number in gender.
The now Lupo is masculine.

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,980
Gus says, Feminine
Lopez, masculine, plural,

5
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,990
and Cassie's feminine, plural. You
also found out about agreement.

6
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,380
The article Elu matches the
masculine singular noun in Isla loop,

7
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,280
but the feminine plural

8
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,970
Alaska says that covers the
basics of adjectives to Bonu.

9
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,790
Good has forums like Bono, Bono, Barney,

10
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,980
and Barney to match the noun.

11
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:39,720
It describes Benet dare born the looper.

12
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,430
Bonu. An English adjectives
are said before the noun,

13
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,760
but most romance adjectives
follow the noun. You dare delay,

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,670
delay,
delay.

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Some adjectives have four forms like
Bonu with typical masculine and feminine

16
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:04,720
endings. Others just have
two forms, a singular

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,800
in a lake and the plural like UCI lays
plurals work just like noun plurals.

18
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,020
So there's the expected
eastwest split bonding.

19
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:22,021
He Day in the East Bonus Das in the West.

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,360
He Day in the east.

21
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,750
Eds with delays in the west.

22
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,260
Determiners also work
a lot like adjectives.

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,700
These include the definite
and indefinite articles there.

24
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,120
The demonstrative is for this and that

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,540
you stay there and the possessives
like male my to your nose through our

26
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,600
May. I you Dan, most right there

27
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,550
question words began with quo like the
pronouns queen and Queen or the adverb

28
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:25,644
Quando.

29
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,733
Yeah,

30
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,450
the determiner.
Wiley for which agrees with,

31
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,900
it's now widely there.

32
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,773
See,

33
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,010
pay attention to the order of adjectives
and other agreeing words within a noun

34
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:50,620
phrase. As mentioned,
adjectives tend to follow them.

35
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,230
A few very common adjectives
like bono precede the noun.

36
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,660
Okay.

37
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,660
On the left most side we find determiners
like articles or possessive or even

38
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:07,710
both articles and possessives.
Mab wanting you death.

39
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,500
[inaudible]

40
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,523
right.

41
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,580
Classical Latin had endings for
comparative adjectives like easier and

42
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,680
superlatives,
like easiest.

43
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,370
The modern languages used phrases with
more instead with mice or pluse for more

44
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,700
[inaudible]

45
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,570
Louis [inaudible]

46
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,300
for easier.
Then it's mice Faqih liquid

47
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,780
or blue.
Spiky liquefy.

48
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,470
Yeah.

49
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,830
The superlative is most
often illuma is fuck you lady

50
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,990
or [inaudible] Bay.

51
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,490
Although the old ending is
CMO has survived for emphasis,

52
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,050
meaning really easy.
A small set of adjectives.

53
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,030
Stubbornly retain their old
Latin comparative forums,

54
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,350
notably Bonu good meliore better,

55
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,910
but best is normally
Illuma, Yoda, and optimal.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,930
Once best now means really good or great.

57
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,863
Okay.

58
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,020
We'll spend a few moments on adverbs.
Adverbs include words like Bennet,

59
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,200
well in contact banner sings well
and 80 yesterday in Eddie can tie

60
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,250
languages can also form adverbs
productively out of adjectives.

61
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,240
When Western romance
languages attached the ending

62
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,200
maintain to a feminine adjective.

63
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,830
It's already made adverb collateral,

64
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,930
clear Colada maintain comes to
me clearly in Portuguese, French,

65
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,250
Italian, and so on. Romanian
didn't share in this innovation.

66
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,140
There's so much more to share,

67
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,210
but this quick tour has opened the door
to adjectives and adverbs in the romance

68
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:42,630
languages.
