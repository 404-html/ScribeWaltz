00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello world and hello
people of Native Lang.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,320
I'm Jessica from comp Tom and I'm so
excited to be a guest here talking about

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,330
the intersection between
language and code.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm also really excited to be
here at Youtube Space New York.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,010
There are amazing cameras.
The super talented crew.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,630
You even get to see me dance can
laugh at it. Comment. All right,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,890
let's get down to business and find
out if computer languages even count as

8
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,160
languages.
I think their new spoiler alert.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,640
I am so jealous right now.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,510
I just found out that 10th graders like
Sally are gonna Start getting foreign

11
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,510
language credit for learning to
program games on their iPhones.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,800
No slugging through years of conjugating
Sarah and a star like I had to do.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,500
But you know Sally's mom,
she's a,

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,580
she's a bit iffier about this because
she says that programming languages with

15
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:55,581
all the curly braces and weird semi
colons and strange Matthew symbols are

16
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:59,190
nothing like a foreign language.
Is She right?

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,420
Is Matthew looking code like
this really a language language.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,050
Welcome to come chomp the only show on
the Internet where we crack jokes in

20
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:18,051
binary zero one one zero one one
zero m zero one don't get me wrong.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,870
I actually really enjoyed my
time in high school Spanish.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
Maybe don't ask me to order a meal when
we're out because you were most likely

23
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,960
going to get the Cabeza.
They cheapo. Sorry.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,280
Now I'm a programmer and I get to look
back and wonder what I was learning

25
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:35,970
Spanish. Was I really doing
anything different than
when I was learning to code?

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,340
I mean in my code I use words.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,230
I use syntax to put those words together
and I even use related languages and

28
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:47,520
dialects. Oh, that's right. In
programming, there are language dialects.

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,560
It all sounds so languagey,

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,980
but does it look languagey facts alert.

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,580
Woo.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,520
You know it's going to be good facts
because these are my good facts. Glasses,

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,900
if you want it to.

34
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:06,260
How do you think you could tell whether
learning to program was like learning a

35
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,160
foreign language.

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,990
You could round up a bunch of programmers
and just shove them into an MRI and

37
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,880
scan their brains while
they're reading code.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,840
And that is exactly what
Yanet Sigmund and team did.

39
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,980
Trudeau is guys,
actually no,

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm a programmer and I really hate in
close spaces. Don't put me in there.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,720
So let's say that you're a coder and
you're holed up in an MRI machine and they

42
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:36,800
show you this. What does it mean?
Well let's read it together.

43
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,310
I'm a program stick label Var one on the
number 23 and another label of our two

44
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:48,020
on the number 42 now pull out a label
temp, but don't put it anywhere just yet.

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Now take temp and stick it where of our
one is then PLF var one and stick it

46
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:58,900
over there with bar too. And you can now
take far too and put it backward temp.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,940
After this whole run around, which
number did our label var would end up on.

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,290
That's right. We switched them. All
right, this, this is kind of fun.

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,010
I like reading code. Let's do
another one. I'm a program too.

50
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,040
So this is auto.
Who wears the name tag word.

51
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,850
Give me a switch to flip when I get the
right answer and give that switched the

52
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:19,840
name tag result.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,550
Start one counter counting up from zero
and another one counting down from the

54
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:28,480
end of the word as the first counter
counts up and the second counter counts

55
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,030
down, you go until you reach
the middle of the word.

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,350
And at each count compare the two
letters and if they are the same,

57
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,660
keep going.
But if they're different,

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,280
flip that results which to false and
stop doing everything you're done.

59
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,530
Just tell us whether
result is true or false.

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,700
Did you figure out what this did yet?
Come on. I know one of you language guys.

61
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,540
Has it figured out?
We just checked if auto is a palindrome.

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,360
And for those of you that aren't sure,
auto is,

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,460
so what type of brain patterns do you
think lit up when coders were reading code

64
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,294
like this?

65
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,010
Probably just the ones that deal
with math right or totally wrong.

66
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,560
It's the ones that deal
with language and memory.

67
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,550
Basically being a fluent coder looks a
whole lot like being a native speaker.

68
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,260
One, two punch. It's my upper
cut or I don't know my job.

69
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,580
Go out right now and demand
foreign language credits
for your programming smarts.

70
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,490
If your goal is to teach someone
to think in a new language,

71
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,510
you pretty much can't go wrong with
programming unless you're teaching basic.

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,500
You need to stop teaching the kids basic.
It is not a good idea.

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,330
Details to come later,
tragic traumatic details,

74
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,621
but you know,

75
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:42,550
if your goal is to have a whole cultural
experience to read Don Quixote and

76
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,620
accidentally ordered the visitee Chico,

77
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,730
it's not really something you
can do and see. All right,

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,750
I hope you'll spend a few more videos
with this program are talking language.

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,520
I'm Jessica from comp champ.

around here on native Leng where we're
doing a short series of videos together

82
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,580
about the awesome overlap
