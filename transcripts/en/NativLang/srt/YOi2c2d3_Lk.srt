1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,660
Translating your family tree into
another language should be simple, right?

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,520
Just pick a family member and look
up the kinship term. So in some, wow,

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:12,630
your sister is your ouzo
unless you are her brother,

4
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:17,130
in which case she's your 12th
[inaudible] and for the Ashanti,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,960
your parents nephew is your cousin.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,270
They accept your father's sister's
son who might also get called father.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,690
Clearly there's not just one
way to talk about family,

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,350
but the intriguing thing is with
thousands of languages around the world,

9
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,710
there aren't thousands of kinship systems.
In fact,

10
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:36,540
there may only be a handful.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,110
Let's start with you.
Your generation zero by your side.

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,470
You have siblings.
Let's give you a brother and a sister.

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,090
One generation up. We meet your
parents, mother and father,

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,670
they have their own siblings, your aunts
and your uncles up one more and oh look,

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,870
your grandparents, okay,
back to your uncle and aunt.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,000
They're children are down in your
generation and they are all cousins.

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,060
No matter which aunt or uncle
on which side of the family,

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,490
what we just described is the
Inuits kinship system. No,

19
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,970
not English that we do use this
system. See. Traditionally,

20
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,480
the world's languages are
grouped into six kinship systems.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,460
Languages in this Inuits system treat
close family differently from family to

22
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:32,070
the side of them,
their collateral kin.

23
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,360
Now imagine if we dropped this
lineal collateral distinction,

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,560
the terms for aunt and uncle would become
indistinguishable from the word for

25
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:45,120
parents and siblings and cousins would
use the same terms for each other,

26
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,780
which is exactly what
happens in Hawaiian kinship.

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,550
It cares about something else too.
Are you a brother or a sister?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,790
If your sister to your sister
or brother to your brother,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,220
you use one word taekwondo,

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,460
but a brother to a sister
or a sister to a brother.

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,810
They have their own brother or sister
words. That's still not enough though.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,140
You also need to respect age.
In Hawaiian,

33
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:15,141
there's one sameness word for an older
sibling and a different sameness word for

34
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,680
a younger sibling.

35
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,840
The younger brother of a brother or a
younger sister have a sister Archinaut.

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,770
Well,
just like English has anyone at kinship.

37
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,270
There are other languages that use the
Hawaiian system to remember the psalm one

38
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:35,040
word. Ooh, so sometimes shortened to
oops, that's for siblings. Sameness to,

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,130
and this can get confusing here.
Let me make you a chart,

40
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,240
save it and please review it before you
ever try and translate brother or sister

41
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,950
in a Mulatto Polynesian language.

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,530
Notice how these two systems we've
been using lump terms together.

43
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,320
So many distinct people
under the same word,

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:56,490
cousin as so many different people
getting called Auntie and uncle. Well,

45
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:57,900
what if we broke these apart?

46
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,770
What if we gave terms to every single
relation from yourself on the tree?

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,480
Your wish comes true in the
Sudanese kinship system.

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,850
If you studied Latin,

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,030
maybe you tried to map ancient family
terms onto your English ones or in at ones

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,830
in English.
It's a strange world,

51
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,580
but the old Romans didn't
talk about family that way.

52
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,030
They had distinct terms for each of your
various aunts and uncles and cousins.

53
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,960
Your mother's sister is not
your father's sister. After all,

54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,040
this isn't just some ancient system today,

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,310
Chinese kinship terms aren't
leased as descriptive as this.

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,160
Plus they demand you pay attention to age.

57
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,900
Just imagine the piles of basic kinship
terms mandarin has because of this,

58
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,490
I've even read that finding the shortest
path between kin members in your family

59
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,220
answering questions like what
do you call your mother's uncle?

60
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,610
But that gets tricky enough that you're
better off using computer algorithms to

61
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:02,410
solve it. But Hey, at the very least,
everyone is clearly labeled. Okay,

62
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,530
a simpler one.
Start from our terms,

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,710
but then switch up how you
label your parents. Siblings.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,650
Your father's brother
is also called father,

65
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,530
and your mother's sister
is your mother too.

66
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,580
It's their opposite sibling that
gets the auntie uncle status.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,110
Your father's sister is your aunt and
your mother's brother is your uncle.

68
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,030
Logically the children of your mother's
sister and your father's brother become

69
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,900
your siblings,

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,030
but your father's sister's children and
your mother's brother's children are

71
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,864
your cousins.

72
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,000
The result is the Iroquois system and
it draws a very clear line between

73
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,900
parallel cousins and cross cousins
right there and the everyday vocabulary.

74
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,150
Why would you want a system like this?
Well,

75
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:50,350
you might want it if you culturally
pay attention to cross versus parallel

76
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,730
cousins because you consider cross
cousins and marriageable partners,

77
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,100
but you keep your parallel
cousins out of it.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,170
The Ashanti Kingdom and
Ghana have a similar system,

79
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,660
but as the British learned
through experience,

80
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,030
there was a small but critical difference.

81
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,590
The Ashanti King inherits a royal
throne called the golden stool.

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,430
British colonizers were eager
to groom some regal allies,

83
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,790
so they sent the king sons away
for a good English education,

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,020
but they were left scratching their
heads when the golden stool skipped right

85
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,980
past these princes. See,
when your father passes away,

86
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,330
the next in line to take care
of things is his sister's son.

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,250
That's right on his death.
Your cousin becomes your father.

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,360
When that happens,
it's a kind of crow kinship.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,810
You're still the uncle and your father's
brother and daunting your mother's

90
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,940
sister,
just like an Iroquois,

91
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,390
but you do something very
interesting on your father's side.

92
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,590
Your father's sister is your aunt.
Okay, but here's where it gets strange.

93
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,320
Her daughter is also
your aunt and her son.

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,210
Her son is your father.

95
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,700
It's rare for terms to cut
across generations like
this, but in the cro system,

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,080
aunt and father do.

97
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,970
The normal reason given is that crow
kinship pays attention to maternal lines

98
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,710
through the father's sister.

99
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,310
If only the British had known you could
do the opposite of this or the mirror

100
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,960
image.
Start from Iroquois again,

101
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,140
but this time use the same term for your
mother's brother and for your mother's

102
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:31,241
brother's son calling both of them your
uncle and so who ends up being your

103
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,540
uncle's daughter, the mother's
brother, uncle, not the cousin, uncle.

104
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,610
She is your mother.

105
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,530
This is called Omaha kinship and if
we're going to blame mom's sister for Cro

106
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,530
will chalk this one up
to patrilineal societies.

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,030
Earlier on I told you there were
traditionally six kinship systems,

108
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,760
so then we're done.
Hold on.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,940
Consider this kin system from south India.

110
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,910
It seems like just
another Iroquois system,

111
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,390
parallel cousins or siblings
and cross cousins, our cousins.

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,890
But watch what happens when we
zoom out and take a wider look.

113
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,470
There's even more crossness going on.

114
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,650
This is Dravidian kinship,

115
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,600
a system that said to prefer across
cousin marriages. It's complicated.

116
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,070
If you focus on you,

117
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,750
but keep that goal of marrying your cross
cousin in mind and go up a generation.

118
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,620
Think about the cross cousins your
parents could have ended up marrying.

119
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,260
Let's circle all the cross
cousins who were there,

120
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:35,261
potential spouses for your
mother and for your father.

121
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,180
If your parents married one of them
instead their kids would have been your

122
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:45,950
siblings. You can marry your siblings,
so these are your parallel cousins.

123
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,170
The ones your parents couldn't marry
would give you cross cousins and marriage

124
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,370
material for you.

125
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,200
That is the opposite of what we'd
expect from an Iroquois system.

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Father's male cousin and mothers,
female cousin.

127
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,970
Having kids that are your parallel cousins
while they're opposite cousins have

128
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:09,530
kids who are across cousins to you.
Well there you have it.

129
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,440
Our world's seven kinship systems.

130
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,750
At least that's the traditional count,
but before I let you go,

131
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,130
what about these questions that kept
coming up is I spent my nights researching

132
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,090
kinship for you.

133
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,280
What about systems that are hybrids that
don't quite fit or are even seemingly

134
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:32,000
untranslatable. Also, why
do these systems exist?

135
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,290
Where did they come from? Finally,
I've been using family trees.

136
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,920
But what if our assumptions are wrong
and these terms aren't really about

137
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:42,740
genealogy or ancestry.
Now,

138
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,080
I don't mean to sell you a rug
just to pull it out from under you,

139
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,420
but these questions would
make a great followup,

140
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,700
which is something you can vote for.
If you are my patron on Patrion,

141
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,220
you can grab some unique rewards and
stay updated about native laying.

142
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,750
Like this time I posted about a
kin term explorer I coded for you.

143
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,540
If you're a patron,
you should definitely come try it out.

144
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,550
Thank you to patrons for voting for this
video and to everyone. Until next time,

145
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,230
may you and your family stick
around and subscribed for language.
