1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,850
I recently finished my biggest project
yet all animated tour of the history of

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:11,020
writing, but before we move on, I wanted
to take some time to cover two things.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,380
One,
what we missed and to what we got wrong,

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,950
but I think there's someone better
for this job. The narrator herself.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,290
Hi, I'm Jessica. Uh,

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,180
hopefully you already know me
as the voice of thoughts pill.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,160
If you haven't had a
chance to catch that yet,

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,620
I highly recommend it and there's
a lot of great stuff in there.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,550
I'm also the girl who was about to start
showing you how your life is made of

11
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:38,090
code over at comp comp,
but a thoughts pill. Yeah,

12
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,930
this was really a labor of
love and as it stands now,

13
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:46,931
we put about 10 to 15 minutes into this
film for every single person that's

14
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:50,570
watched it so far. So that's a
very personal connection for us.

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,430
99% of that as Josh. Ah, he did all
of the art, the animation, the music,

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,060
the scripts for the animated history
of writing, even recorded himself,

17
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:02,960
narrating the whole thing
over and over and over again.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,760
But he ended up liking my version
better. And so, yeah, I'm the narrator.

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,520
Um, one thing that that
meant was that, uh,

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,700
there were a lot of parts
where you actually hear the
like languages that we're

21
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:16,490
talking about and I don't
actually speak those languages.

22
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:21,140
So we ended up cutting that. Um, but let's
talk about what else we didn't get to.

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,303
So,
uh,

24
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,310
in the beginning we had pre history and
the cave rushes over so much of history

25
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:32,030
and speculation about proto writing and
we kind of used it as a metaphor just as

26
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:34,130
much as an actual historical place.

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,340
And when you leave the ancestral
cave and inter the civilized world,

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,960
we need Loga graphs.

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,460
The original plans had us pan from the
dark cave up to the wellness world above

30
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,090
once we were up in those cities,
we profile a handful of them.

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,200
Some of them like the Minoans and creek
just barely get a mention later on in

32
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:53,240
the series.
And if you start digging,

33
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:57,100
it's not hard to find other early scripts
that we skipped all together like LMI

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,980
or Cypriot or is that the tech and
the questionable unsolved mysteries of

35
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:04,370
prehistoric writing like Vincia
symbols and into scripts and whatnot,

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,310
integrating those really
started to sidetrack the story.

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,230
So after going down the
birth of writing hitlist,

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,980
we ran into that early tension
between meaning and sounds. Well,

39
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:19,490
we originally had a second tension
for these cradles of civilization.

40
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,890
What is writing for these symbols helps
civilizations expand. CARF propaganda,

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,470
track their goods,
time after time.

42
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:30,830
These old loba graphs
are about kind of boring,

43
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:35,831
mundane things like counting goats and
barley or that king so and so ruled for

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,790
such and such a long time and smoked
all of his enemies throughout his many,

45
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,030
many days of being awesome. But, uh,

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,400
fortunately for the
romantic and all of us,

47
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,660
some writers were capable of turning
even these early symbols into verbal art.

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,450
The most famous early
example is Gilgamesh.

49
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,950
A story that top the cuneiform bestseller
list for over a thousand years,

50
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,000
which is really,
uh,

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,940
we ended up folding the idea behind
this tension into the flexibility and

52
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,160
creativity versus consistency.

53
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,800
Tension that shows up when
we talk about the manuscript.

54
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,070
It was particularly sad
for us to cut Gilgamesh.

55
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,210
It's a story that reminds us that
civilization and its innovations team,

56
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,170
the savage human,

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,310
but at a cost nature is wild
and mortality as elusive,

58
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,850
but civilized humans can live on through
their physical achievements during

59
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,930
their lifetimes. It was sort of an
uncanny prism for thermoses warning.

60
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:33,010
In the introduction. Oral ideas
are embedded, but thoughts pill.

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,650
The technology of writing DM beds you
and offers some degree of immortality to

62
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,350
your thoughts and actions.
Okay. Onto rebus writing,

63
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,520
we talked a lot about taking a character
and using it for it sounded like value.

64
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,451
Of course,

65
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:49,960
there's another option beyond using the
same character for smaller or larger

66
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:54,580
chunks, and this will apply to later.
Innovations to the character can change.

67
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,450
And the process.

68
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,440
Anyone who's ever learned to read another
writing system has the experience of

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,050
painfully copying every little nook,

70
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:06,280
cranny and Seidler of assemble before
finding out which strokes are meaningful

71
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,870
and which ones can be left out.

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,150
Add service to an I and
you're fine believe that.off
the top and things kind of

73
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:17,290
get weird unless it's in Turkish and
then they're entirely different letters.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,530
Although it's a crucial step in
learning to script like a native.

75
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,650
The stroke game is something
that's obvious from the inside,

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,960
but can really perplex outsiders.

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
I contrasted using characters
for syllables and cuneiform
versus continents in

78
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:32,081
Egyptian.

79
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,700
Hieroglyphs to technical
details got cut out here first.

80
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,930
The writing direction,

81
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,250
we later mentioned when we get to China
that were words go and where they stop

82
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,300
matter in writing.

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,380
We were going to be a bit more specific
for hieroglyphs showing you that when

84
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,170
you're reading hieroglyphs
you read into the bodies.

85
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,390
Some materials will
tell you into the faces,

86
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,900
but even when there's no face around body
parts still face against the direction

87
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,550
you're reading unpacked.

88
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,500
And for cuneiform we had a whole section
on Josh's favorite cuneiform court.

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,310
That's right. He's got a favorite,
those Sumero grams and it came to grams.

90
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,040
That evolved as the script was
passed around the Fertile Crescent.

91
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,320
It didn't really fit well into the script,

92
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,220
but it became its own video and this clip
from that video made its way into the

93
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:19,210
documentary when we talked about how
the early choice to use syllables shaped

94
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,920
every later version of the script.

95
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,780
So there was also an important question
to ask here and when they hit through

96
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,680
other close to home,

97
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,760
is it surprising or novel that the
leader scripts around the Mediterranean,

98
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,780
you know the ones that lead
to our alphabet end up using
consonant segments like

99
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:39,781
the Egyptians had already been doing in
an ask it whatever onto determinative.

100
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,680
This revolved around Chinese and
spills over into the part on Maya,

101
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,670
but it's really worth taking some time
to read up a bit on how this happens in

102
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,650
other scripts and how
they use determinitive.

103
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,800
Egyptian and cuneiform
actually use them too.

104
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,010
It's one of the reasons each section
in this story is structured a specific

105
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,870
development in the history of writing.

106
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,980
We're looking at these as common solutions
to problems faced by multiple scripts,

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,150
not just cultural teams.
Uh,

108
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,830
the other reason is we wanted to jump
around to exotic locales because traveling

109
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:14,690
is fun, even if it's just in a
cartoon. Anyhow, a determinative,

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,290
I lumped classifiers and
determinative and radicals together.

111
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,160
If you're interested in putting those
concepts apart and digging deeper,

112
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,170
I recommend starting with this paper on
the use of complementation in the Maya

113
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,830
script.
Basically,

114
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:31,070
it argues that we should use the term
determinative for a meaning sign that

115
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:35,300
helps us choose the spelling of a word
and classifier for our meaning sign that

116
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,700
tells us which category
the word belongs to.

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,270
Another thing when it comes
to China is stroke order.

118
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,710
The way of writing the characters. Josh
actually thinks this is so important. He,

119
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:49,520
uh, wants to write a whole separate
script and do a different video for it.

120
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,990
I know he recorded a rant
a really long one. Uh,

121
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,870
I don't know if he's planning on
animating it, but if you're interested,

122
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,840
you might want to let
them know. Oh yeah. Uh,

123
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,430
both Chinese and Maya remind us that sound
writing isn't the right way to write.

124
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,340
Be Era of history doesn't inevitably
point from meaning to sounds.

125
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,600
Inventing phonetic characters does not
mean that you abandoned your lower graphs.

126
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,370
Innovations and traditions can hold hands
and it mixed writing system like this.

127
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,330
Uh, and a lot of you picked up on
that but I wanted to make sure that we

128
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:24,230
specifically put that out there.
So from Central America we flew to Egypt,

129
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:28,880
which reminds me we're going to stand
by this title for now. Provocative,

130
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,060
yes, but not misleading. Uh Oh.

131
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:36,290
I will say one other thing about Egypt
by focusing on the trajectory to our

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:36,771
alphabet.

133
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:40,550
We totally missed out on another thread
that was in the initial story plans from

134
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:43,280
Sogdian to Mongolian.
I don't know about you guys,

135
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:45,650
but I personally would love
to have seen what kind of fun,

136
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:48,950
crazy characters Josh came up
with for covering Mongolian.

137
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,470
I'm getting Iskcon is one of my favorites.

138
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,740
Gene just however you want
to say his name, the same.

139
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,130
Oh man came up later too when we didn't
get to tell the stories about to carry

140
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,920
on and Ethiopic Alpha Cilla Berries,

141
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,540
although at least the Abita did squeeze
in there for one quick little exercise

142
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,960
at the end of India.
Speaking of Alphabets, uh,

143
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,500
I really liked the way Greece turned out.
Josh wants you to know,

144
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:16,250
he thinks it's a bit funny that the Greek
is that the Greeks and thoughts pill,

145
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:20,120
no etic stuff that wasn't common.
Iem acknowledged in ancient times.

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,200
You're a new friend friend talks about
Troy and the ancient Greek script that

147
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,850
actually predates the alphabet,

148
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,420
but he stopped short of calling
it linear B. Truthfully,

149
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,720
it's already an anachronism that he knows
about this script in the first place

150
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,520
and can mention how it works.

151
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:38,060
Since early documents written in the
Greek alphabet suggest that Greek

152
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,400
civilization fell into
complete illiteracy.

153
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:45,500
Essentially they all forgot how to write
and that brings us to an interesting

154
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,540
idea that actually didn't make the cut.

155
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,980
It's what I mentioned to Josh when he
shared his outline the first time people

156
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,850
losing writing.

157
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,970
This animation looks at writing as
a of inventions and improvements.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,930
But what about the steps backwards and
sideways and even away from writing?

159
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,340
What impact did those have on writing
to get a grasp of the strangeness here?

160
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,290
Think about the use of
pictures and nonverbal layouts
of information on websites.

161
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,920
And what other ways do we supplement
or move away from the written word? Uh,

162
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,260
speaking of Alphabets,

163
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,130
we brought up the correspondence between
symbols and sounds and then the birth

164
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,060
of the Latin alphabet.

165
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,200
We originally wanted to go down the road
a bit and discuss historical spelling,

166
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,430
English and French spelling, guarded
tutorials for this. But over time,

167
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:33,090
the alphabetic principle can get a little
lax since a word might be spelled the

168
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,920
way it was when this system started,

169
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,690
even when its pronunciation is modernized
and flagrant disregard for the ancient

170
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:40,730
tongue.
Uh,

171
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,780
the example we plan to show for this was
from Irish and it went like this, right?

172
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:50,640
The word who are, yeah,
that's right. Uh, oh.

173
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:55,040
And yeah, we totally hear you. That
we did not cover uppercase, lowercase.

174
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,590
It's definitely a topic
that we want to go into,

175
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,500
but we didn't have time to fit
it into thoughts, pill. Um,

176
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,880
it really is worth a video of its own.
Okay.

177
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,090
So on to ob dots that the pirates trader
was a reminder that writing back in the

178
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,610
day wasn't some guy grunting
and making crude marks.

179
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,630
There was already an entire industry
behind each stroke of the pen or press of

180
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:19,800
the stylists into clay.

181
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,310
Think of all that it took to make an
ancient Mediterranean text harvesting to

182
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,680
book Paris, cutting the stocks
open and cutting it into strips.

183
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,870
Loing layers of those strips together
crosswise to make a sheet using well

184
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:36,960
developed trade networks to distribute
that paper overseas. It goes on and on.

185
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,490
The Phoenician merchant was a mental
prick to help remind you of the obvious

186
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
that writing leans on the development of
civilizations, the materials, resources,

187
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,434
trade routes.

188
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,830
It was also a way of getting you to
think of the economy of writing and

189
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:54,750
extending that to get you to ask
questions about how the economy shaped the

190
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:58,680
look, the use, and eventually
even the dispersal of writing, uh,

191
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:02,310
writing on the horizontal Recto or
front of the book pirates instead of the

192
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:06,870
vertical verso of the proprietress or
how ancient letter shapes changed from

193
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:11,280
chiseled to inky. On the Mediterranean
map, we see some scripts pop up.

194
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,590
One of them is in Iberia.
Well,

195
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,590
the rather unique Paleo
Iberian scripts are semi Cilla.

196
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:21,180
Barry's derived mainly from Phoenician
with some possible Greek influence.

197
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,520
Okay.
Time is getting away from us here.

198
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,770
I promise I'll just
mention a few more goodies.

199
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,780
In Phoenicia we tackled matrass and
pointing and originally asked a bunch of

200
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:34,140
questions for you to ponder
what's better in a writing system.

201
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,590
Optional extras like fouls added
in only when you really need it.

202
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:41,700
That set things straight or a system that
demands clarity even when that clarity

203
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,230
is a peripheral less. Um hmm.
Let's skip ahead to king. Say Dawn,

204
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,050
who's heard exotic tales
of the west of India.

205
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,190
This was a nod to the concept of
India as the West in East Asia,

206
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,400
the most well known example
of this reference is in the
Chinese novel journey to

207
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,710
the West.
But if you start reading,

208
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:03,280
you can dig up a whole history of
relationships. Here's another hint.

209
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,640
The Go Juwann of Japanese Kona have
an order strikingly reminiscent to the

210
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,970
layout of Devanagari used to
write Sanskrit. Uh, yeah. Okay.

211
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:14,310
So in Korea,
uh,

212
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,550
since feature alphabets get treated
as a separate type of writing system,

213
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,850
we thought it was worth
including in our major moments.

214
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,950
Some of you definitely disagreed.

215
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,210
Korea is also the location
of our technical error
that just stands out like a

216
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,570
sore thumb. Josh switched the
name of two of his sheep keys.

217
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:34,540
So these Korean characters got
swapped out in the final cut.

218
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,290
So after Korea we end with a look back.

219
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,560
But our idea of a look ahead at the
future of writing didn't make it.

220
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,510
What about changes in how we communicate
like pictograms or signs or relying

221
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:51,040
more on videos and images to communicate?
What about emojis?

222
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,770
Are we communicating
better info faster now?

223
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:57,180
So writing is just less necessary and
it's not doing the same job at once.

224
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:01,240
Debt West Cecil shared a similar
thought in his talk about the future of

225
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,640
language and it's been on our minds.

226
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,420
Oh and a do different scripts do
different things to our brains.

227
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:11,320
How does growing up with a different
writing system impact anything else?

228
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,880
Like the way you think about language or
ideas or even the way you store words?

229
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,080
Uh, finally, and Josh has been trying
to get me to stay quiet about this,

230
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:24,050
but I want to tease and say that there
were a decent number of Easter egg

231
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:25,480
scattered around the world he built.

232
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,990
I don't know if all of them showed up
in the final camera angles and whatnot,

233
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,020
but a lot of them do. MMM. Okay.

234
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,050
So that wraps this up.

235
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,110
I just want to thank you guys so
much for taking this journey with us.

236
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,010
I'm really glad I got roped into this.
I was very hesitant at first.

237
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:46,070
I said they're not going to want to hear
a different voice on the channel. Um,

238
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,760
but you guys were so welcoming and your
feedback in the community has just been

239
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:50,630
fantastic.

240
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,670
If you're interested in seeing more of
me or learning how your everyday life is

241
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,900
made up of code or hopefully both,
uh,

242
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,930
you can check out my
new channel comp chomp,

243
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,970
Josh is going to be over there animating,

244
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,450
making stuff fly around the screen and
coming up with a lot of the cool topics

245
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:08,330
that we do on that channel as well.
Uh,

246
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:12,620
and if you have it already
and you definitely should
subscribe your native lane

247
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,350
and encouraged Josh to keep
doing videos about language.

248
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,440
Otherwise I'm going to steal him and he's
only going to be doing computer stuff.

249
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,610
Now. I know he's really busy with classes
and has some other projects, but um,

250
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,080
your encouragement when it's genuine, it
really matters. And, uh, even if you know,

251
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:30,440
you just had him get some
quicker sketchier art out
there. The videos are fun.

252
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,170
Anyway, subscribe for language and now
subscribe for programming language.

253
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,090
Fun to jump.
