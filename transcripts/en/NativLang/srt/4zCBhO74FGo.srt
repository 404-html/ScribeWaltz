1
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,720
Let's add one more feature
of romance verbs to persons,

2
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,970
tenses and aspects.
It's called mood.

3
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,290
So far the verbs we've met
gave us information about
who performed an action and

4
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,730
when they were all matter of fact
about it, kind of tasks for you,

5
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:06,990
seeing fantastic for you
sang that kind of thing.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,810
We might even say that they all indicate
who does what there in the indicative

7
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,760
mood plain statement. Send
questions, have indicative verbs,

8
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,460
whatever the tents, contacting
Latino, Qantas in Latino,

9
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,960
such verbs ask for or provide
information in a vanilla way.

10
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,570
Did this happen? Yes, that
happened. Is it? Yes, it is.

11
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,930
These kinds of statements. It's account
for so much of what we say in right,

12
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,880
including most of my narration.

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,740
What if the mood isn't so indicative?

14
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,360
Latin and romance verbs also mark
actions as possibly contrary to fact.

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,460
We're not necessarily the case.
This is useful when you want hope,

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,700
fear, doubt, need or recommending action.

17
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,720
Continuing with my apparent
fondness for the verb Cantata,

18
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,170
compare one indicative form can Thomas
to a subjunctive what containers as in

19
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,510
sped at and teams she hopes that we sing.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,450
It's a matter of fact that she does hope.

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,560
So that's in the indicative but
we may or may not actually sing.

22
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,200
So this second for this
and the subjunctive,

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,620
I slid a little word quoting there.

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,160
It's the word for that in Latin and it
becomes something like gay in nearly

25
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:41,171
every romance language we use k to connect
the subjunctive or to the verb that

26
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:46,190
triggers the subjunctive as
in hope that want that need,

27
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:48,830
that recommend that and so on.

28
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,940
So we did quote is
followed by an indicative

29
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,160
but spirit quote by a subjunctive

30
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,560
notice the thematic vowel,
it switches.

31
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,060
This is a key feature that distinguishes
indicatives and subjunctives.

32
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,630
That's present tense subjunctive stuff.

33
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,740
We can also use a past
subjunctive this past door.

34
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,320
Imperfect subjunctive is especially
useful in hypothetical's.

35
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,410
I beer in languages also developed a
future subjunctive for uncertain future

36
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,370
actions like when I will
sing or if I will sing,

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,290
which remains in Portuguese but
not Spanish window can perish.

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,130
Western romance languages have conditional
endings that work a lot like the

39
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,500
future indicative ending,
step attached.

40
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,380
The verb for have to the
end of an infinitive.

41
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,360
These are fractions.
Someone would do.

42
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,440
The imperfect of have is
used in France and Iberia.

43
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,800
Hmm.

44
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,470
The predicate of have is used in Italy.

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,440
Yeah.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Other languages including Romanian
and Sardinian built phrases or use the

47
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:49,730
imperfect indicative to get
the same conditional meaning.

48
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,883
Yeah.

49
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,500
Imperatives issue a command. The
basic idea is simple. Take the verb,

50
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,740
add the thematic.
Val got into

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,150
some common verbs. Are you
thinking shorter? Deek, Tara?

52
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
Also plural,

53
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:15,860
forms for ordering around
a group of people via data.

54
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,450
A negative command uses this
subjunctive in Iberia. No one contests.

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,740
The infinitive is used in Italy,
northern Canada,

56
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,280
in languages that use third person forms
to address you politely like contact

57
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:37,670
for both sings and you sir or Madam Sing.

58
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,860
The subjunctive comes back into play
for both positive and negative commands.

59
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,973
Contact

60
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,103
content,

61
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,180
person number, tense aspect, mood.

62
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,960
You now all the basic features of romance,
verb endings.

63
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,420
Next time it's on to helping verbs.

64
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,140
Notably [inaudible] to
have an aesthetic to be.
