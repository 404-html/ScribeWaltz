00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,460
This video is part of a series that
expands on the basics of historical

2
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:18,720
linguistics by exploring various
types of regular sound changes.

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,690
Today's sound changes assimilation.

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,610
Two sounds are involved here and one
of them becomes more like the other.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,710
The assimilating phoneme picks up one or
more of the features of another nearby

6
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:35,250
phoning the Latin root.
Sim is the key here.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,620
The two sounds become more similar.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,300
You've learned about phonemes
and their features in my series,

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,340
the IPA for language of learning,

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,080
the place of articulation and manner of
articulation of consonants will come in

11
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:53,490
especially handy for the basics of
assimilation. Let's take an example.

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,680
The Latin phoneme.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Doug has the features dental plosive and
voiced the phoneme s has the features,

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,570
Alveolar fricative,
the Latin word,

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,440
odd prefixed to the word Simi.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,320
[inaudible] results in the
pronunciation as see me Latier.

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,663
In other words,

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,820
d comes to share all the features of the
nearby s and is completely assimilated

19
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:21,354
to s

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,533
okay.

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,160
Speakers of languages the world over
use a simulation to make words easier to

22
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,560
pronounce for ease of articulation.

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,160
There are different types of assimilation.

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,690
Does d assimilating sound take on every
feature of the phoneme that triggered

25
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:46,380
assimilation? If so, the
assimilation is complete.

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,190
If it only takes on some of,
or even just one of the features,

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,830
that's only a partial assimilation.
The assimilation in the Latin, uh,

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,880
see me laugh too.
Above is complete,

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,200
but when I pronounce and
as em before p and input,

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,240
that's a partial assimilation.

31
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:03,920
Okay.

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,970
The two sounds are both by label, but
one's a nasal and the other's a plosive.

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,453
Okay.

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,120
Are the two sounds side by side,
we'll call that contiguous assimilation.

35
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,690
Are they more distant from each other?
Not adjacent. That's non-contiguous.

36
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,130
The two examples of assimilation I
have given you both involved contiguous

37
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:26,964
phonemes.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,160
If my tongue gets twisted
and I accidentally say a
Russian shoved marine for

39
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:36,030
Russian submarine,
the assimilation is non-contiguous.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,050
Does the change sound come after the
sound it's assimilating to that's a

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,730
regressive assimilation or is it heard
before the sound it's assimilating to

42
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,770
that would be a progressive assimilation.

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,630
My embarrassing mispronunciation in
Russian submarine is an instance of a

44
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,130
regressive assimilation,

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,020
but the assimilation of n two and input
is a fine example of a progressive

46
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:02,854
assimilation.

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,690
We can also label assimilations by the
features that are changed in the process.

48
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,690
If the assimilating phoneme
is originally voiceless,

49
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,810
does it pick up the feature
of voice from the other sound?

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,450
This sound changes called voicing.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,410
Nearly all vowels in
human language are voiced.

52
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,100
Consonants often become
voiced between valves.

53
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,290
Some Italian speakers pronounced the
phonemes or as between two vowels asZ ,

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,130
like in Lamea causa my house.

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,170
The change from s two Z is an
instance of interval Kalik voicing.

56
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,920
If the assimilated phoneme is voiced,

57
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,980
does it pick up the feature voiceless
from the other sound or from being at the

58
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:54,770
end of a word? That's the opposite
phenomenon called d voicing,

59
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,280
so the word have ends in
the voiced phoneme vote.

60
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,190
The word too begins with the
voiceless t. Some speakers, Dee voice,

61
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,840
the two foot when they pronounce
the expression, have to as Hafta

62
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,690
does the assimilating sound move its place
of articulation closer to the palate.

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,180
This happens when the sound
it's assimilating to already
has a palatal or near

64
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:22,010
palatable place of articulation.

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,420
This is called palatalization and
it's significant triggers include the

66
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:30,260
consonant. Yeah, and the
vowel e. For instance,

67
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:35,261
some English speakers pronounced the
word student as student in rapid speech.

68
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,790
The alveolar to assimilate to the
palatal. Yeah, and becomes palatable.

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Vilar Chuck student does the
assimilating sound change its manner of

70
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:50,660
articulation so that the airflow
is closer to a fricative.

71
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,210
This is fricking to visitation and
less restricted sounds triggered.

72
00:04:55,211 --> 00:05:00,211
This kind of change including fricatives
and valves stops often undergo this

73
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:01,484
assimilation.

74
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,420
I've both heard and said
the mispronunciation up
through four up through that

75
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,980
pronunciation.
Fricker devices,

76
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:14,981
the plosive puck as it is simulates
to the fricative for of course,

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,920
the phoneme can assimilate to any
place or manner of articulation.

78
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,930
I won't list all of them here.

79
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:25,160
Further examples of assimilation to
specific places of articulation include

80
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,600
Labor utilization.

81
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:30,710
When the assimilating sound
becomes more lady and valorization.

82
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,910
When the assimilating sound becomes
more Vilar when it comes to matters of

83
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:39,620
articulation, the assimilating sound can
become a plosive and African and so on.

84
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,690
There's an opposing change
known as this simulation.

85
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,250
Two sounds are involved here too,
but one becomes less like the other.

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,200
The disseminating phoneme loses one or
more of the features that shares with

87
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:59,000
another nearby phoning the two
phonemes more dissimilar. As a result,

88
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,850
the English phoneme is a
voiceless by Labor stop.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,070
If you say Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers as fast as you can,

90
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,290
chances are you dissimilate one or
more piece by pronouncing them as an f.

91
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,170
Here becomes less like the surrounding
piece by turning from a stop and do a

92
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,800
fricative, but there are more
serious examples in language history.

93
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,190
The Latin root pedagogian getting comes
into English as pilgrim rather than peer

94
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,880
grim.
The first are dissimilar rates to an l.

95
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,860
The simulation has the same
characteristics found in assimilation.

96
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,280
They can be progressive or regressive
contiguous or non-contiguous involve

97
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,450
voicing or d voicing and et cetera.

98
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,640
The one consistent difference is that
this process involves two sounds becoming

99
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,500
less alike.

100
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,970
That's all for assimilation
and dissimilation watch
again next time when I'll go

101
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:03,300
over the kinds of sound changes that
involve adding and getting rid of south.
