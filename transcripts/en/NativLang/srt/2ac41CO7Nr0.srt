1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:03,880
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,630
Last time on comp top cold war
computers were showing real promise at

3
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:11,770
translating Russian into
English Georgetown University
stage to successful tech

4
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:16,600
demo and the press was impressed. Times
were good for machine translation. Aye.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,180
Aye. Aye. Okay. Now that we're back,

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,920
the money starts rolling in because if
the public support something politicians

7
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:25,420
can't lose by throwing money at it,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,200
but people started taking
sides round one fight.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,340
In this corner you had your
linguistically minded perfectionist.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,380
They wanted to feed computers,

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,350
all the detailed grammatical
rules about every language.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,930
And in this corner there where your
brute force crowd brute force or is,

13
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,620
we're all about the evidence.

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,340
You set computers loose on real sentences
and they should be able to find the

15
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,520
patterns on their own.
Unfortunately,

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,030
progress from both sides just wasn't
living up to the bold claims made after

17
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,410
Georgetown and the public.

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,650
They started to notice in 1962 hypers
ran an article titled the trouble with

19
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,810
translation and with a title like that,
you know,

20
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,540
it was going to be fair and
objective. The, uh, author.

21
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,000
Recall the demonstration of
machine translation where
the computer was given the

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,500
scriptural nugget. The spirit is
willing, but the flesh is weak.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,840
The output we are told is laughable.
The liquor is holding out all right,

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,650
but the meat has spoiled.
I just want to pause for a moment.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,260
The dymo reported there didn't happen,

26
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,520
but this story and Harper
is really illustrates how
far machine translation had

27
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:32,140
fallen a few years earlier.

28
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:36,460
Those exact same reporters were just
heaping praise on it and now it was the

29
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:41,170
butt of their magazine jokes.
The scientist's stepped in
for some damage control.

30
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,070
Do you remember Bar Hillel? Our first
full time machine translation man,

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,550
he argued that our expectations
were just unreasonable.

32
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,350
Natural language could be ambiguous
and computers can not handle ambiguity.

33
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,470
We shouldn't expect them to
translate languages for us.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,980
We should just get them to help
us translate for ourselves.

35
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,000
Translating languages was way more
complex than even the experts could have

36
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:08,350
guessed. It was a literally turning
out to be harder than rocket science.

37
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,420
Now in the face of souring public opinion,
the u s government, because again,

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,730
they only like throwing
money at popular things.

39
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,930
They commissioned the Alpac Josh,
is that a Lama? Wait, no, sorry.

40
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,340
It's not a Llama.

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,730
It's actually an elite group of seven
experts tasked with deciding the

42
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,870
usefulness or uselessness of machine
translation and computational linguistics

43
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:33,340
as a whole. That's quite a
task. Their verdict. Oh, we'll,

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,210
we'll get into that. But first there's
something you need to understand.

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,240
Throughout the history of
artificial intelligence,

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,480
people get sold on promises far beyond
their wildest dreams and it happens so

47
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:49,150
often that there's a term for it,
the Ai hype cycle,

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,640
and when things go wrong,

49
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,210
the chill sets in a chill
with lasting effects.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,520
It's called an AI winter, and no amount
of jackets protect you from that chill.

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,100
So the verdict,

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,520
the 1966 ALPAC report concluded that we
do not have useful machine translation

53
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,790
and there is no immediate or predictable
prospect of useful machine translation.

54
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,820
Ouch.
Computer as it turned out,

55
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:20,500
were twice as expensive as human
translators and they were doing way,

56
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:25,330
way worse. The officials were convinced
and machine translation was defunded.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
The first AI winter set in

58
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,720
computers and language
obviously had a rough start,

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,480
but I promise it gets better.

60
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,730
Eventually subscribe,
go eat your Borscht and uh,

61
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,010
write some code chunk.
