1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,260
This isn't even a full word,
but can you guess which language in says?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,860
Chances are you can thanks to that very
Spanish letter and yet hold on there.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,580
Once upon a time. This end with the deal
day wasn't so Spanish. Take it apart.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,900
You'll find the tail of an ordinary
mark that evolved into an extraordinary

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,734
letter.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,380
Spain has a national hero, a really old
one, like almost a thousand years old.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,140
They call him and see, or if feed. Look,

8
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,740
Spain is notorious for lifting its fees,

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,120
but out here in the western hemisphere
and even over there [inaudible] it's

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,950
[inaudible] and sit at the stuff a
good national heroes supposed to do.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,850
He wielded a legendary weapon.
He fought cunningly for various factions,

12
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:52,110
but always kept bigger goals in mind.
He won the hearts of the peasants. Oh,

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,520
and he loved about Viet Guy.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,960
His trusty steed one legend tells
us how they met when he was young,

15
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,560
super the Reno. His Godfather took
him out to pick his very own horse.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,570
He was treated to a parade of
beautiful stallions. Go on, pick one,

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,620
the Betty Best one.

18
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:12,621
You see somehow and seed peered through
all this splendid mains and cuts side of

19
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:17,940
the most awkward horse in the
bunch. This one, I want this one,

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,160
God father couldn't believe it, but
Viet Guff for, why'd you pick that one?

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Whoa buddy. At Guy. Yes. I think
his name shall be Bobby [inaudible].

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,020
He'd be a good horse.

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,480
US mean you spent centuries weaving tails
like this about your beloved said the

24
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:37,110
most epic of these epic tales is a
poem written in the 12th century.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,160
Gunther Daimyo seed.
Some of my PsyD. Sure,

26
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,700
there's this older Latin history written
closer to the events, but the people,

27
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,870
they liked the epic poem.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,380
That poem was preserved for us in one
single rare manuscript and if you want to

29
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:56,370
read this medieval manuscript, you need
to know old Spanish, not just Spanish,

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,060
no older Spanish,
different words with different meanings,

31
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,310
different spelling and pronunciation,
different grammar,

32
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,590
but before you can jump into any of that,

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,690
you're blocked by this
scribes handwriting.

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,370
The problem isn't really his handwriting.
He was a fine scribe, neat and tidy.

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,990
The problem is this script
is not your script. Yes.

36
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,840
It's the Latin Alphabet,
but even once you adjust to the letters,

37
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:23,190
there's something strange. Get your
nose close enough to smell the paper.

38
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,900
Actually, the big amino parchment, close
enough to see the little squiggles.

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,750
Interesting thing about parchment.
Back in the day,

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,900
scribes didn't go to the store and
pick up packs for pennies. A page.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,080
This book making stuff was
a very expensive endeavor,

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,840
partly because of that ancient scribes.

43
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:44,160
It started coming up with ways to save
paper but keep their manuscripts. Pretty.

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,250
One trick was to make words shorter.

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,160
With hundreds of years of scrabbled
practice behind the medieval scribes had

46
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:54,420
amassed a treasure chest of symbols.
They can get fancy,

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,700
but here's a simple one
you'll see all the time.

48
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,630
The did DLoose what it for.
We'll look at the letters below it.

49
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,580
Sometimes they're shorten words.

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,450
Scribes were abbreviating everything
from sacred names to run of the mill

51
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:11,620
pronouns. When they did this though,
they left a nifty over mark as a hint.

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,440
It has a more specific use though.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,770
Look at the words Mundo commanded and
also don't Lord and Donya lady from Latin

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,580
dominus and Damina.

55
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,150
The scribe could spell them out or he
could remove one consonant and write this

56
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:31,720
tittle loose on top of the letter before
it. Notice which consonant got removed.

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,170
The nasal n writing ends on top of
previous letters instead of inline isn't

58
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,950
something we can blame the seed for.

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,570
It had been trending for centuries
for both Latin nasals ends and ams.

60
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,320
Good luck getting through
too many medieval manuscripts
without it ends above.

61
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:51,220
Val's ends on top of consonants,
ends everywhere, but these ends,

62
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,510
we're still optional.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Take the word for year on those
which had two end side by side.

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,310
That word became Spanish
on you as a scribe.

65
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,340
You could take that second day in and
write it as a [inaudible] loose above the

66
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,174
first,

67
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,200
but you could just as well take the first
and have it hop on top of us or just

68
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,110
leave them side by side.
Over time though,

69
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:15,580
the other marks fell away and [inaudible]
the former double end was left all

70
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,190
alone in Spain.
Seemingly one of a kind.

71
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,020
Why did only this one remnant
stick around? Well, it was useful.

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,240
The other nasal marks were interchangeable
with a full on n but Latin double n

73
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,100
evolve to have its own
pronunciation in Spanish. Yeah.

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,100
Ania this leftover did to loose isn't
as lonely as it first seems though.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,950
Just next door,
Portugal found this same mark,

76
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,760
very useful for writing nasal
valves in modern Portuguese.

77
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,770
They still use it not above end though,
but to mark nasal. Ah, and Oh hmm.

78
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,420
Hmm hmm. Oh, and here's a fact
drop to impress your friends.

79
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,490
The name for this mark
did to loose became delay,

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,080
which got borrowed into
English as Tilda in Spanish.

81
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,180
Though the day doesn't
just mean this thing,

82
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,350
it's the word for any special marker
diacritic including the accents.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,000
But today's NBA isn't an end with
a funny mark on it out in Spanish.

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,270
One more change had to be made and image
change that academia Hispaniola Royal

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,540
Spanish Academy got together in the
early 17 hundreds to organize and oversee

86
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,100
Spanish vocabulary time to impose
some order on this language.

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,860
Their dictionary still the gold standard.

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,940
But back in 1726 to group was barely
taking a first stab at this dictionary

89
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,860
business with their Dick
soon audio authority.

90
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,540
That is now you won't find any listed
as a letter on the spines or title pages

91
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,890
of any of its six volumes.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,180
But entries that start with an
ea are listed separately after n.

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,430
It's a move the academy has since fully
committed to today and it has its own

94
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,830
seat at the Spanish alphabet table,
middle keen say,

95
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,960
and it's so quintessentially Spanish
that it's become a symbol of Hispanic

96
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,260
culture. Here I just localize my
channel for Spain and Latin America.

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,110
You laugh, but that is how some companies
do it. So what? We're in his seat,

98
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,920
stay ordinary marks on parchment.

99
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,880
Found a way to outlast the rest of them
and become a full fledged Spanish letter.

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,050
A letter that only catches the occasional
reflection of its younger days in

101
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,570
scattered relatives from
not to distant lands.

102
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,190
Stick around for more linguistic
stories and subscribe for language.
