1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,020
Recognizing patterns and
applying them in new situations.

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,170
Maybe two key features
of language and thought,

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,040
but what happens when the patterns wrong?

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,810
Last time I pulled out a critter
you've never seen before, uh,

5
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:27,520
Schwab and I think we agreed that we'd
immediately know what to say if I had

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,870
five or six of them,

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,940
but that's not thanks to the chuffed so
much as it is to our understanding of

8
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:34,774
plurals.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,180
There's a paradigm for plurals in English
and it works for words big and small,

10
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,290
short and long,

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,690
so we have reason to be pretty confident
that this is just how plurals work in

12
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,524
English.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,110
Then eventually we run into some
word that doesn't fit the paradigm.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,840
We've abstracted and analogize
this general idea about plurals,

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,250
but its inadequacy is
staring us in the face.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,380
This roadblock is not just a problem
for the grammar of English plurals.

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,320
If you ever had to fight your way through
some basic logic before you noticed

18
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:18,321
that we use general statements like all
this or every that to draw conclusions.

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,960
But just like with mice and alumni,

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,470
we're always at risk of running smack
into something that doesn't fit with the

21
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:33,100
general statement. We've worked so
hard to abstract and apply by analogy.

22
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,660
If you were living in the 17 hundreds
and your name where David Hume,

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,180
you would have pushed
this point very hard.

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,390
Wondering why from this experience we
form any conclusion beyond those past

25
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,270
instances of which we have had experience.

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,220
This gets called the problem of
induction and it asks us frankly,

27
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,790
why we should have predicted that the
plural of mouse would be mouses just

28
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,380
because the plurals of other
words and in in s of course,

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,310
if I'm learning English,
this seems like a fairly trivial event.

30
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,320
I note the exception. I hope that I
remember it next time and I move on,

31
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,390
but not all failed.
Applications of paradigms are this Mundane

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,060
Nassim Nicholas Taleb uses the
metaphor of the Black Swan.

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,380
Swans are white,

34
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,470
not black or so Europeans thought until
British ornithologists John Latham

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,350
stumbled across real life,
black swans in Australia,

36
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,020
black swan has since become a mascot
for rare events that have a surprisingly

37
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:40,130
huge impact.

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,080
These abnormalities drag us
has obvious after the fact,

39
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,820
just as obvious as it is to an English
speaker that mice is the plural of mouse

40
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:53,930
and to modern avian enthusiasts
that not all swans are white.

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,380
We can of course incorporate this new
information and maybe even be little

42
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,860
smarter with our paradigm by
hedging against big unknowns.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,960
But can we go the other way?

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,920
Let's turn to plurals just one more time.

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,360
Children might get corrected
for saying mouses. Sure,

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,900
and they might step in line,
but at some point,

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,250
English speaking children applied
this same paradigm incorrectly,

48
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,680
but instead of incorporating
the correction,

49
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,840
they grew up to overturn old norms.
Sometimes we simplify.

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,790
Other times we preserve the irregularity
and there's even room for creativity.

51
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,250
As brand new patterns emerge

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,590
as we learn about language and thought
and use thought and language to learn.

53
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,290
Exceptions to the rule can give us some
use for feedback about the patterns we

54
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,040
think we see.
