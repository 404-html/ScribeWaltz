00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,180
This series now contains over a dozen
videos presenting the basic grammatical

2
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:52,420
features of Volcker Latin
and the romance languages.

3
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,960
Each video contained many
examples pronounced out loud,

4
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,650
but none of them address the
topic of pronunciation directly.

5
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,020
This video finally offers a rough sketch
of the pronunciation of vulgar Latin

6
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,340
and early romance with some notes on
how that pronunciation developed and

7
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:13,180
splintered as Proto Romance divided
into the modern romance languages.

8
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,570
Classical Latin valves had two values,
short and lung.

9
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,350
The name refers to how long the
val is held short versus bond.

10
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,543
Ah,

11
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,830
you can hear that long vowels are held
out longer in time in vulgar Latin.

12
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:42,850
The quality of a vowel became a major
difference between short and long vowels.

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,740
Some vowels sounded different even
if they weren't held longer, shorter,

14
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,970
long and short,
but short a long,

15
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,540
a short or long, Ooh, short,

16
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,300
long.
Ooh.

17
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,780
For example, Benny has a short
a well Belterra has a lung.

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,853
Hey,

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,030
notice how crucial the differences
in some prodo romance words.

20
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,400
The all in song is short,
but the o in Solo is long.

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,440
You can see that long mark
Macron above the long vowel.

22
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,890
Sometimes the short mark
is used above short valves,

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,120
but usually the valves aren't written
unmarked outside of educational materials.

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
The length of a is trivial. The
modern languages, most of the have a,

25
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:41,480
whether the val was a
longer short I in Latin,

26
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,290
but the historical length of
other vowels matters more often.

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,980
Sometimes what were once just long and
short versions of the same vowel or

28
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,000
spelled quite differently in the
modern romance languages. For example,

29
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,200
the verb bolted he can with a
short all comes out as Spanish way.

30
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:04,940
The French old Italian Walter

31
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,810
classical Latin used develop
vowel combinations I n hour,

32
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,880
which tended to but didn't always
merge with devours a and o.

33
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,310
Here's the word. Oh, cool. And
some of it's modern cognates,

34
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,240
and this is the word Christ Yona,

35
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,500
which was regularly pronounced
you on it in early romance.

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,080
Diphthongs also occur
for short a and short.

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,320
Oh damnit.
Spanish DNA.

38
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,670
Italian DNA. French. Yeah,

39
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,480
or both the Spanish way,

40
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:59,880
the French Romanian Wata.

41
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,510
Most consonants are pronounced
very much as they are in English,

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,320
but pay attention to these ones.
The stops written.

43
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,470
P T and c are an aspirated,

44
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,810
so they're pronounced without that
puff of air in or h sound that often

45
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:28,620
accompanies them in English.
So this word is pronounced battery,

46
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,710
not pottery.
This is to not to,

47
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,410
and this one is Gallo rather than Kelo
considered this an important note for

48
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:40,770
English speakers.

49
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,190
Okay.

50
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,830
The you in Wa and doesn't
fall silent and vulgar Latin.

51
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,810
So lingual and linguists

52
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,390
where aqua and aqua

53
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,470
or

54
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,470
Quando instead of French and Romanian
gunned late Latin speakers drop their H's.

55
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,740
So earlier Latin Hora became vulgar.
Latin aura.

56
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,020
The letter r was trilled
like aroma or threes.

57
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,510
V was pronounced,
not wa like it wasn't classical.

58
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:24,511
Latin Vino v later merges with B and
a few languages including Spanish,

59
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,090
which has been no

60
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,180
double consonants were pronounced long,
just as they still are.

61
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,000
An Italian flammer Ila,

62
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,440
the letters c and g represented stops.

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Casa Kelo both with a cuff sound,

64
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Gusto and gained both with a Gus sound
eventually see was soft and before Eni

65
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,950
originally palatalize to something
like Chia and eventually so sure.

66
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,590
Or some cello,
Spanish Filo,

67
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,270
Romanian change.

68
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,280
The same thing happens to
GE or GM before he and I,

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,640
which comes to sound like Joe
or Joe and later in Spanish,

70
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,610
Portuguese, Italian,
Jen Bay, Spanish Kane.

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,880
Uniquely Sardinian doesn't do this.

72
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,881
So g and c stay close to their original
and Gus sounds before he and I in

73
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,030
Sardinian cello,
French CN,

74
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,580
Sicilian shell, but Sardinian, Caillou,

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Kya and gear.

76
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,090
Our examples of palatalization vulgar
Latin consonance turn Palatal by

77
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,020
pronouncing a short, yeah, after the
consonant and before another val.

78
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,100
This why sound is written
with an I or sometimes the j,

79
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,690
so and or no is palatalized
in the word bowel.

80
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,210
New l gets palatalized in Maryetta,

81
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,190
t is palatalized in Gracia.

82
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,270
This little y sound has a lasting
impact on later romance words.

83
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,403
For example,

84
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,470
that palatalized t in Grotzia doesn't
stay a t thanks to palatalization that

85
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,730
Tiaa eventually becomes
a sung in French glass,

86
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,290
sir, in Italian Grotzia
and in Spanish. Yeah.

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,970
Palatal consonants don't
always get treated the same.

88
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,120
Either take the Prodo romance word venue,

89
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,560
which has the Palatal [inaudible]
sound in Portuguese and Galician.

90
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,760
This comes out as venue and Benu,

91
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,820
but Italian and Spanish
have vengo and Bingo,

92
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,710
which no longer have palatal
sounds, romance, consonance,

93
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:59,711
where sometimes soften between valves and
this was routinely the case in western

94
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,320
romance languages like
French, Spanish, Katelyn,

95
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,270
oxygen and Portuguese.

96
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,050
This process called [inaudible] explains
why the final t in Tato becomes voiced.

97
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
D and Portuguese [inaudible] a the sound
in Spanish gone tallow and disappears

98
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,840
entirely and Caribbean
Spanish going to allow.

99
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,740
This is also how he's single.

100
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:29,741
S comes to sound like zoom between two
vowels in many romance languages aside

101
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,280
from Spanish and Romanian,
Casa, Italian, Gaza,

102
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,240
Portuguese causa,
but Romanian Casa,

103
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:43,921
vulgar,

104
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:48,921
Latin and early romance syllables often
contain a vowel or a consonant plus

105
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,520
avowal better equaled a single
consonant may close the syllable factor.

106
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,780
Yeah,

107
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,780
consonant clusters were also found like
plug in [inaudible] or the script in

108
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,433
script.

109
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,370
Most words had a prominent louder
syllable and this stressed syllable was

110
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:14,480
typically the second to last one,

111
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,020
like in [inaudible] or Casa.

112
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,940
Sometimes it was the third to last
syllable, like in Pearl spittle or Betty,

113
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,500
the other syllables where unstressed,

114
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,290
unstressed syllables where sometimes cut
out. This happened at the end of words,

115
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,530
particularly in Romanian, French, Occitan,

116
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,450
Katelyn and Romance Burrow
Sparrow becomes French post spare,

117
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,520
which lost its final syllable
and solid becomes Spanish son.

118
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,930
Without that final e,

119
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,600
sometimes the middle syllable
was cut out better equal.

120
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,540
Lou was shortened to Betty clue
and later Spanish belly grow.

121
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,910
This has been but a rough sketch of
vulgar Latin ed romance pronunciation.

122
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,990
It's meant to help you understand the
pronunciation of words throughout the rest

123
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:08,760
of this grammar of romance,

124
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,870
but it's also a springboard for learning
more about the pronunciation of Latin,

125
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,970
of individual romance languages,

126
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,850
and of the historical sound changes
that took place between them. Validity,

127
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,480
and thanks for learning with

128
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,630
me.
