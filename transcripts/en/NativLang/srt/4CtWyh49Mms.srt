1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,610
Studying up on early modern English taught
me how an old letter end up printing

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,670
press made us start
mispronouncing a Scottish name

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,760
in my search for the true
sound of Shakespeare.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,880
Long hours at the library paid off with
way too many amazing subplots to squeeze

5
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:25,000
into one video before I tuck them into
my notebook and turn out the lights.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,190
Let me share one story I really loved
about a different kind of English.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,520
Thanks to a lung linguistic pass.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,850
There are more varieties of English and
the British isles in in the rest of the

9
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:39,550
English speaking world.
At the extremes,

10
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:42,070
these actually behave
like different languages.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,390
We meet one of those
extremes in the far north.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,090
Scott's not Gaelic,

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,650
not standard English with a
truly Scottish bear. Scots,

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,660
it's the local lowlands way of
saying Scottish, just as their word.

15
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:00,760
Inglis evolved to ingles.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,790
Scotus shortened to Scott's.

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,860
Consider your company carefully before
you weigh in on calling it in lead or a

18
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,100
dialect. It's a bit of a
charged issue, but either way,

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,500
sculpts has its own separate history.

20
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,660
The northern edges of Middle English
gained a strong foothold in the lowlands

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,150
pushing Scottish Gaelic to the highlands.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,860
The Scots lead emerged and evolved
into its own sub branch of England,

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,060
complete with Scott's dialects and even
a literary form with quirks of its own

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,790
quirks like Yo.

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,640
This early English letter was a form of
Ge used for a few sounds including the

26
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:44,080
glide Yang Yi and the recipe sound
at the end of its own name. Yo,

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,570
this letter didn't last down.

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,710
South Claxton's printing press
would print g and you like this,

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,230
but when Scotland got it's printing Press
York was still alive and Yi you and in

30
00:01:56,231 --> 00:02:00,730
the name McKinney. Kenny. Hi.

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,000
See, back then printing
involved wouldn't sticks.

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,320
Metal pieces forms to people to ink
in press. It was a whole process.

33
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,230
These weren't the days of holding down
a key on your phone until you got a

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,250
little pop up to choose.

35
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,450
The right special character type was
literally metal pieces stored in a type

36
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:20,050
case, so you'd print with the type you
had on hand and you would keep around just

37
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:23,510
enough to print. That's spelled
the beginning of the end for y'all.

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,850
The story goes that when the presses
in Scotland didn't have the type,

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,610
the middle piece for yoga and
there wouldn't type cases,

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,710
they just grabbed the letter zed
instead close enough. Right? I've,

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,690
especially since they're handwritten
forms look so similar at the time.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,970
It's not that confusing either.
After all,

43
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:42,550
whether you called this
letter zed or is it modern?

44
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,600
Scott still doesn't use
it much for the sound,

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,410
but some words became so well known in
print that eventually people base their

46
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:52,570
pronunciation on that printed spelling,

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,730
reading a XA sound back into a word
that never had it in the first place.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,670
This shortcut didn't impact
thing in or dramatic,

49
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,570
nor the earlier spelling of the I yet,

50
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,070
but it is how mckenny
turned into Mackenzie.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,170
This cork is a great example of how
language varieties can preserve a little

52
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,100
bits of history,

53
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,760
even events as specific as hauling a
printing press into town and picking

54
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:21,860
letters out of a box. All
right, and I'll follow up.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,930
I'll get back to work on the next full
tail. The one you patrons voted for.

56
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,060
Consider becoming a patron yourself.

57
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,960
If you want to help me spend more time
making videos, I deeply appreciate it.

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,950
Most importantly,
stick around and subscribe for lead.
