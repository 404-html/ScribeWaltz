1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,530
Languages change over time,
but how fast,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,940
let's say you fall into a coma, hearing
your language spoken all around you,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,810
you snap awake in the same place,
but at a different time.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,530
There's still speaking your language,
but you can't understand a word.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,570
How long were you out?

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,040
How long can a language last
before it becomes unrecognizable?

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,500
Last time we met in eccentric
Australian tongue called Jubal,

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,350
a language where nouns
can be edible or harmful,

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,710
where you have to talk completely
differently around your inlaws and we're

10
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,790
speaking vaguely is considered a serious
flaw and they don't even have a word

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,660
for language.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,490
At least it used to be that way because
when linguists came back to visit the

13
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,360
jitter ball non decades later,
they're language had changed.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,160
Then we heard from Swatis
who argued that actually no,

15
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,530
all languages change at the same pace.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,630
Replacing core vocabulary to constant
rate keeping over 80% of their most basic

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,051
words.

18
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:09,051
After a thousand years swat ish then used
his vocabulary lists and calculations

19
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:14,130
to draw a line marking how long we'd
expect to wait before dialects of a single

20
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,880
language evolve into separate tongues.
A line in the sand,

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,400
the elusive moment of change itself,

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,550
spot any problems with this idea
these researchers shore did.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,580
They grabbed their Swatis lists and
pointed them at two sibling languages,

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,800
Norwegian and Icelandic.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,070
The basic question they wanted
Swatis to answer was this,

26
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,600
how many years had passed between old
Norse and Norwegian and how many between

27
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:43,710
old Norse and I [inaudible] looking
at wordless for replacement,

28
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,420
plugging that stable rate assumption,

29
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,960
it looks like Norwegian
diverged a thousand years ago.

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,270
Not a bad estimate actually.
Well,

31
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:55,410
modern Icelandic is 200
something years old.

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,910
In other words, no one should be speaking
Icelandic right now. Call Up Iceland.

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,130
Your language is a mistake.
The numbers don't lie

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,100
today thinks to debunkings like this
and the fact that Icelandic exists

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,570
historical linguists except that the
rate of language change varies and for

36
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:16,080
various reasons.
According to this paper,

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,130
one factor could be population size.
In a computer simulation,

38
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,900
smaller populations borrowed and replaced
words faster than bigger communities.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,570
The author of that Dribble Grammar
Dixon himself proposed another factor.

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,780
He called swatting as idea that Kimra
of glottal chronology and argued instead

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,200
that languages have long,

42
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:41,850
stable periods but then change in
punctuated bursts during moments of social

43
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:46,110
upheaval. So is that why Gerbil
changed so much? So fast,

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,370
a small population and a
quick punctuation? Well,

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,940
a careful look at the switch from
traditional durable too young,

46
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,190
durable suggests another variable.

47
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,700
The biggest reason why the language
changed much in just decades.

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,710
Language death.
A few decades before Dixon's grammar,

49
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,740
about 30 [inaudible] still lived around
the upper Tully river hanging onto the

50
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:14,920
old ways. But these days it seems
like nobody is learning durable,

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,520
threatening,
even young dribble with extinction.

52
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,330
It's not just assimilating to Australian
English or turning into a bare bones

53
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:26,260
pidgin or creel. This researcher
tells us it's not that simple.

54
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,620
Behind the steep change from
traditional journal too young,

55
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:32,350
durable was this smooth,
oldest to youngest.

56
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:37,030
Dropoff durable has been dying
its own death and language.

57
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,530
Death is its own variable
with all these complexities.

58
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,250
How long do we have to be out before
we wake up to a brand new language?

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,200
It depends.

60
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,920
Some tongue seem to keep their
shape over a thousand years.

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,670
Others do indeed changed
quickly within centuries,

62
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,340
but take another look at that question
we started with how long can a language

63
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,130
last before it becomes unrecognizable,

64
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,870
not unintelligible to earlier speakers,
utterly unrecognizable.

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,890
See, even if a time traveling Jubal
speaker couldn't understand the language,

66
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,410
they might still be able
to pick out familiar words.

67
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,670
How do we know this will happen?
Because it has happened.

68
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,220
This isn't the first time
[inaudible] has evolved.

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,700
We got a glimpse of its past changes in
part one when we met a relative of Juba

70
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,670
where the word for dog,
his dog,

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,500
that word took linguistic know how to
prove it was actually related to durable,

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,490
not English,

73
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,660
but other patterns among Australia's
languages are easier to recognize.

74
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,650
Whatever you think about Swatis lists,
here's a fun use for them.

75
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,460
Compare basic vocabulary from a bunch
of Australian languages and look for

76
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:49,570
cognates. Comparing cognates
and sound changes in grammar.

77
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,250
Linguists focusing on
Australia's languages looked
far back beyond dribble to

78
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:58,360
recover its entire family,
the Pama Newman languages.

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,620
There is dissent. Dixon in particular
came to reject this grouping,

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,030
but the consensus is that Paul Newman
constitutes the largest family on the

81
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:11,200
continent by far using
various lines of evidence.

82
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,460
Pama Newman is held to be
around 4,000 to 5,000 years old,

83
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,740
which is intriguing because look what
happens when we estimate the ages of other

84
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:24,250
language families.
We get similar time depths.

85
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,200
The one aberration here seems to be Prodo
Aphrodisiac of story for another time.

86
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,680
Some historical linguists worn that.
They don't do dates,

87
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:35,110
but some that do see a limit here.

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,090
Comparing languages can only take us
several thousand years into the past.

89
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,480
Of course,
in my tower of Babel first language video,

90
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,030
we did meet some mavericks
who dare to go even further,

91
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,160
so how long should we keep
that hypothetical linguistics
patient under to make

92
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,520
sure they wake up to a change to language?
Well,

93
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,190
within hundreds of years
we could expect degraded

94
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,000
with hand waving on dates and exactly
how understandable it will be,

95
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,370
but within many thousands of years,

96
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,460
even distant traces of the
language may have dissolved.

97
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,330
They'll keep your apologies handy
in case this answers too vague.

98
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,164
For the general bond

99
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,370
stick around at subscribed for language.
