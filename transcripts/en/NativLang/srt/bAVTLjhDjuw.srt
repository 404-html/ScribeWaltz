1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,060
You might use the word
abstract when someone's making
ambiguous statements or to

2
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:17,320
refer to groups of things you lumped
together or to talk about things you can't

3
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,200
pin down to a single
object in space and time.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,920
Research papers have abstracts.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,210
Art can be abstract and we can
engage in abstract thinking,

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
but what is it about something
that makes it abstract?

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,200
Give me a pattern. Here's
one. Orange basketball, we'll,

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,970
what's the pattern here? Well,
when you compare them side by side,

9
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:47,530
you get this idea of round
just by focusing on this shape,

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,570
we can abstract this shape from these
three objects in the world around us.

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,310
Of course, if you're more of a top
down guy like Plato was, I get that.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,530
You start with the idea of round and you
can go out and find instances of realm

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,410
things, wheels, balls and oranges.

14
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,060
It was comparing things in our world
that made us stop and think about the

15
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,710
abstract concept round.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,090
That kind of comparison is a huge
step when that gets us humans.

17
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,850
We're really far,
but that's not quite enough.

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,270
Let's look a little closer at the steps
we took to get to that abstract notion

19
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,330
round.
I mean looking at this object alone,

20
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:33,331
we could have easily ended up abstracting
wheel or spokes or tire or something

21
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,170
else. When we place it
next to the other objects,

22
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,590
we compare them to see
their common features,

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,680
but that's still not enough.
Think about it.

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,370
We have a list of specific features each
object has and one of them on each list

25
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:55,300
happens to be shared, but if we take
away the details of each object,

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,190
we get to the abstraction
in the 1960s to know region.

27
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:04,600
Computer scientists recognize the
technological power of abstractions.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,940
They introduced classes which allowed
programmers to define abstract concepts

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,210
like say us fear and objects,

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,410
which let programmers create
specific instances of that class,

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,600
like a golf ball or a globe.

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
They used abstraction to give birth to
object oriented programming and there are

33
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:29,230
many more examples of the
technological power of abstractions,

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,000
but abstract thinking isn't just
the stuff of new technology.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,930
It's something we do every
day with language and thought.

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,130
Even though,
say every cat is different,

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,550
we can have just a word
for the abstract cat,

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,010
same four person.
We can set up conceptual hierarchies.

39
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,240
We can even abstract numbers away to
a simple variable that can take on any

40
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,110
value we need it to. This kind
of thing is extremely convenient.

41
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,120
What's even better is that if
we just go one step further,

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,720
abstractions become even more powerful
and we'll take that step next time.
