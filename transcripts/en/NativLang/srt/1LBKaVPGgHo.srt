MMM.

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,750
Welcome to part three of
native lane.com score.

3
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,920
Send using the international phonetic
alphabet to learn about pronunciation in

4
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,890
language.
This time we'll focus on syllables.

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,120
The previous two videos looked
at vowels and then consonants.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,150
If you grasp the basics
of vowels and consonants,

7
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:35,580
you already have the material
you need to make a syllable.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,400
Vowels sit at the heart of the syllable,

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,190
which is actually called
the nucleus of the syllable.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,080
Consonants are built around that nucleus.
Consonants before the veil,

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,230
before the nucleus are part
of this syllables onset.

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,890
There may be a one or more consonants
in the onset consonants after the vow,

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,510
after the nucleus or the Coda,

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,600
which is Italian for tail of the syllable.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,610
So we can have syllables with consonants
before the nucleus and then after we

16
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:10,200
can have syllables with consonants after
the nucleus and none before we can have

17
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,380
a syllable with consonants,
both before and after the nucleus.

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,550
We can even have syllables with no
onset and no Coda, just a nucleus.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,460
Languages have different ways of building
a syllable. For instance, in Japanese,

20
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,240
you'll tend to hear syllables
that end in a vowel syllables.

21
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,280
Don't have consonants after the nucleus.

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,970
These open syllables have just a
vowel or a consonant plus a vowel.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,780
The vowel can be long or it can be short,
but you'll still stop there.

24
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,980
So the next consonant would be part
of the following syllable in English.

25
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:47,400
However, we can have open
syllables just like Japanese,

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,200
but we also find fairly overloaded
syllables that involve three consonants

27
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:56,790
before and three consonants after
the vowel nucleus. In all cases,

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,290
you can still use the concepts of
syllable onset, syllable, nucleus,

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,320
and Coda to analyze syllables in a
language we haven't yet touched on more

30
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:11,961
complex val nuclei like diphthongs when
we have multiple valves within the same

31
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,150
nucleus,
that's called a dip thong.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,860
Many languages have multiple Val's
sitting at the heart of the same syllable.

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,970
For example,

34
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,560
the English word height contains the
Diphthong Iy at the nucleus of the

35
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:30,090
syllable. There are vowel type
sounds like the glides. Yeah,

36
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,013
and we're,

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,110
which I represented an IPA like a j
and a w and Wa are treated as consonant

38
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,010
sounds,

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,300
but their vowel like sounds that can
straddle a main val to form a diphthong.

40
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,030
Sometimes the vowel in the nucleus is
simply held longer. It's the same val,

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,730
but it's held out for a longer time.

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,210
You can represent such long vowels in
the IPA with a double mark after the

43
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,040
vowel,

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,040
so the vowel e can be to e I've
been talking about val nuclei,

45
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,840
but a consonant may sit inside the
nucleus of the syllable instead of a vow.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,810
Take the English word nerve.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Some speakers pronounced that word
nerve with an art as a syllable nucleus.

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,850
When we write syllabic consonants
like this are in our IPA,

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,320
it's conventional to place a small stroke
beneath the consonant to signal that

50
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,000
it's acting as the nucleus.

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,990
Okay.

52
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,410
Let's talk a bit more generally about
transcribing speech for a moment.

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,710
You've seen slashes around my IPA text.

54
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,210
These slashes are used to open
and close the IPA characters.

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,340
For example, this is a transcription
of the English word dashes,

56
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,210
and this is the transcription
of the Italian word Fata.

57
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,110
Both transcriptions are
enclosed in slashes.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,060
You can break your transcription into
syllables by placing a load dot a period

59
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,130
between each syllable like this.

60
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,570
Okay?

61
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,231
These basics.

62
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:06,470
We'll get you started as you tackle
syllables in any language you're learning.

63
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,150
