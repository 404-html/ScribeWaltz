00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,570
At the end of the last animation I asked
you to share your own stories of uneven

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,310
understanding share.
You did more than I could have imagined.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,480
We built one of the Web's largest
collection of asymmetric intelligibility

4
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:16,500
stories right there in the comments.
You also called me out.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,610
Could I maybe share something personal
about my journey into language?

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,010
That's something patrons have asked for
two, since we have a bit of downtime.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,610
Today's a good day to do that.
In my life,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,150
there hasn't just been one thing
that connected me to language.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,320
It's been a bunch of small moments,
little experiences.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,450
Some of these end up in my videos,

11
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:41,880
so I guess keep watching
to get the full story,

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,490
but if I'm sharing personal experiences,
it might have to be this one.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,310
It's not what I expected today,

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,290
but there are events,
struggles,

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,430
things in my earlier life.
I wouldn't be here without.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,150
These are my scars.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,920
Literally scars at the time.
It's so superficial,

18
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,620
but as a kid I was kind of shy.

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,770
It's something I slowly grew out of,
thanks to a happy family team,

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,501
sports,

21
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:21,501
great friends until I ran into
that life wall called adolescence.

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,140
And that means different
things to different teens.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,530
I got some of the normal
awkwardness and acne,

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,950
but on top of that I began to get serious
scabs and rashes and worse all over my

25
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,940
face,
my hands and my neck.

26
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,540
I tried to cover it up
or at least play it off.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,380
I couldn't always find ways to cope.
Uh,

28
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,910
I'd make it through a school day and I
had rushed to be alone, study or draw,

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,330
ride my bike off on my own on tough days.

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,920
I remember sitting behind bus benches
instead of waiting up front like a normal

31
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:02,580
person, just so my latest scars
weren't out there for everyone to see.

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,660
Why am I telling you this?
Because it mattered.

33
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,300
I was uncomfortable and struggling to
find worth in my own skin and that made it

34
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,920
tough to connect superficially.

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,960
I had to look past my skin in lean on
ways I knew to connect on a deeper level.

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,970
I did this with language.
It helped me relate to people,

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,020
people with their own scars,
people who pass it and present,

38
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,770
opened up and shared stories of
languages and cultures with me.

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,730
They gave me riches more meaningful
than if I'd never had this struggle.

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,400
Eventually it took years,
but eventually I got a diagnosis.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,440
My skin was sensitive to fragrances,
laundry,

42
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,360
deodorant, Cologne, shampoo,
hair products, washing dishes.

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,580
They were all leaving scars.
I made changes and the scars healed.

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,010
That's what they do.
I,

45
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,860
the day my mom helped me take off my
sheets and wash everything and fragrance

46
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,694
free detergent.

47
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,330
I got to leave it behind usually for my
skin and definitely from my mind what

48
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,120
the clucks tick and scars fade.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,770
I get to make up for lost time
for the most part I've moved on,

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,570
which is one reason why these
videos take awhile. Yes,

51
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,560
animation is a thing that takes time.
I've learned how true that is,

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,960
but there's more to my story in an effort
to be a productive part of our future

53
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,810
world and pay for those
hand baskets of food.

54
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,350
I've been on my own years long
journey to be a better programmer.

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,340
Maybe a bit later in life than I expected.
But while you've been watching,

56
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,020
I've been putting in the
work, taking classes, getting
certified coding projects.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,180
This balancing act doesn't pay well, but
in many other ways it's been rewarding.

58
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,780
It even shapes the videos you watch now.

59
00:03:55,781 --> 00:04:00,430
The part of my journey that would become
native Lang is another story when I

60
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,450
shared with patrons,

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,520
but I'm compelled to keep coming back
partly because of those earlier days when

62
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:10,450
language distracted me from my scars.
Well,

63
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:14,740
I've talked about where I've been. What
about you? What is language meant to you?

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,940
Was there a little moment
or a meaningful experience?

65
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,800
I offer patrons much gratitude
for all your support,

66
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,580
and thank you for sticking around
in subscribing for language.
