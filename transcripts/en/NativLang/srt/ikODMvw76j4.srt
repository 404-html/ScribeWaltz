1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,980
Here's the tail of a language.

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:06,540
They can build impressively long words
and why it ended up alone in Europe,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,450
surrounded by languages
that work so differently.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,090
Central Europe,
a patchwork of nations with Jagat borders.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,700
Let me switch to a language map though.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,780
What do you see and probably
still patches, a patch of German,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,760
a romance language, some Slavic
languages and this patch here, Hungarian.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,520
Now look again at this map of language
families that Hungarian patch is a

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,540
language island surrounded on
all sides by Indo Europeans.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,370
After I learned about this isolation and
then calculated out how long Hungarian

11
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:45,180
words are,

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,930
I just had to try out on my young yet
the Hungarian language for myself.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,800
I am not Hungarian though.
Practice along, and correct me,

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,170
but this tail is too good not to share.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Go back 1,122 years to a time when the
Carpathian basin flat landlocked in

16
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:07,020
surrounded by mountains was being
squabbled over and who better to settle

17
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:12,021
squabbles then tribes of nomadic horseman
known to Europeans as angry but to

18
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,910
themselves by the name of their foremost
tribe. Modular led by Arthropod,

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,290
the modulars conquered the basin in
the homeland, taking of eight 94, uh,

20
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,480
homeful Galosh yes,

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,320
lush s is shut and this is how you write
an s but don't flip it or you get a

22
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:33,321
judge on Darien for decades after
these masters of the bow in the stirrup

23
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,560
consolidated,

24
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:39,120
their rule drove a wedge between South
Slavic and the rest of Slavic and rattled

25
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,180
nerves all the way to Italy,
France and Spain.

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,330
It said they even had westerners
on their knees praying.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,320
They see these women got older,

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,340
me better knows Domina
arthropods descendants did
manage to settle in warm up to

29
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:55,800
the west,
right at the turn of the Millennium,

30
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,530
Stephen the first established
a European kingdom,

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,660
a surprising bastion of Christendom,

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,850
but success left Hungarian isolated.
And by the end of this tale,

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,940
this language with it's oddly long words
will reveal just how alone Hungarian is

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,200
and is not. Do you remember
my longest word, adventure?

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,190
Those languages stretched words by taking
a base word and compounding it with

36
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:23,610
another base. Like say you
have two towns, Buda and pest,

37
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,860
and you smash them together into one name.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,460
But that's not the reason Hungarian
pops out. Long words left and right.

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,430
It's base words at a bunch
of grammatical slots,

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,040
mostly at the end slots for everything.

41
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,700
I swear the verb Yelland
means notifier report.

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,290
It's already itself built
from smaller pieces, but
whatever. Let's keep it simple.

43
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,090
Put a bay in front and the action
goes inwards or into Balent.

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,550
Add the reflexive Kazic and your reporting
yourself into logging in while you're

45
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:57,330
at it. Chinks, this subject
to be Olympic Isaac.

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,230
Oh and don't forget slots for tenses and
moods like the conditional Ne Wood in

47
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,490
bail and cause nick nouns
have hoards of forms.

48
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,700
They put Latin to shame.
Take em,

49
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:11,500
but say you wanted to give
something to that human,

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,850
you'll need the date of case embedded
neck. If there are multiple humans,

51
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,470
they're embedded. And if there's
something for all of them embedded CONNEC.

52
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,400
Wow, look at all those intimidating
sounding cases down the list.

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,470
These are just forms for say,

54
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,160
up to being on top of going into,

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,360
going out of and so on.
Same for adjectives.

56
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,980
Knowledge is great, but let's step
this up a bit. Mazzetti great.

57
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:43,300
Like means wonderful using the
same endings. You can have plural,

58
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:46,900
wonderful things and save them
for a wonderful one. Note,

59
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:51,070
city neck or for many wonderful ones,
not city ethnic.

60
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,720
Whoa,
there's more.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,170
How about a slot for comparing
wonderful things to find out which one's

62
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:56,901
wonderful.

63
00:03:56,901 --> 00:04:01,901
Ular built city but and a superlative
prefix slot for the most wonderful of all.

64
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,770
Not City had.
Wait before you take a breath,

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,190
bringing her endings once more leg,
not city beck,

66
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,900
nick who now you see why
Hungarian words get so tough?

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,040
These clumps of roots and
affixes look glued together.

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,810
So linguist named this kind of word,

69
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,080
building a gluten nation
with the Latin root glue.

70
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,920
Some have grown skeptical of the concept,
but it's been resilient.

71
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,300
Part of the glue holding Hungarian
together is it's val harmony.

72
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,890
Did you happen to notice all the,

73
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,690
as those as in the suffix are
there to match the val in the base.

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,460
So the plural of Embeda is embedded,

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,810
but mouths are cyroc and
medic cyroc autonomic.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,880
That's basic Hungarian grammar,
but it's so foreign to all its neighbors.

77
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,950
Why though? We know where it ended
up, but where did it come from?

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,630
The clue to its origins is
right there and it's words.

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,790
Historical linguists traced a trail of
related words back to languages akin to

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,260
Hungarian, nowhere near Hungary, way,

81
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,730
way,
way off in West Siberia.

82
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,770
Together with Hungarian,

83
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,460
these languages are part of
a broader urologic family.

84
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,530
Hungarians ancestors migrated
from Siberia out to the southwest,

85
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,790
bringing their long words to the doorstep
of the Carpathian basin where our

86
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,650
story started. See Hungarian in the
end, you're not completely alone.

87
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,690
You just have a long distance kind of
linguistic relationship set at like the

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,830
ticket ish. Him stick around
and subscribe for language.
