1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,190
Pictures for things and even ideas gave
us prodo riding, but we can do better.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,890
It's time to invent full fledged writing.

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,280
You're ready to grab that Chisel and
get your pictographic and idiographic

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,760
carving on then someone
inventive comes along.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,720
You system is artistic,
but it's not practical enough for her.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,830
Gone are the days of Lascaux the
world outside. This cave is changing.

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,680
She says crops, cities, rulers, markets,

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,190
and she needs a way to keep track
of it all. She likes your icons.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,330
She can use them for goats and Potts
fields and even long walks through the

10
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,300
desert, but she has an
incredible practical streak.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,960
She takes those goats in those
pots and starts to tally the items.

12
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:49,800
She's recording one goat.
She says. Then two goats,

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,550
three goats for goats.
Notice what she's done.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,240
These aren't simple depictions anymore.
They're not just ideas.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,040
She's reading one word for each symbol.
She's in coding language.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,590
Let's slow down here because it's hard
to overstate the importance of this major

17
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:12,410
moment in the history of writing
these goat counts or words,

18
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:17,220
symbols. Now, Loga graphs.
Pictographs can be visualized. Idiot.

19
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:18,420
Graphs can be imagined,

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,750
but loga graphs can be directly and
consistently red logo graphics systems

21
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:28,710
emerge and flourish. And
the early civilizations of
Mesopotamia, Egypt, China,

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,940
and Mexico, characters for
people, animals, land crops,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,110
hundreds, even thousands of logo graphs
for everything under the sun and moon,

24
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,280
including the sun and the moon.
Even after all these millennia,

25
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,380
if you spent hard enough,
you can still pick out the symbol,

26
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:47,730
scratching to weathered artifacts,
bearing the world's early scripts,

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,510
a Chinese turtle and Egyptian house,
a Sumerian head,

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,730
a Sumerian had eating bread. Oh my. And
Jaguar. And in each of these places,

29
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:00,120
in all of these languages,
these were red as words.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,750
We know what these lower graphs mean
and we can put that meaning into words.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
The world is now in a race to
fill itself with logo graphs.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,620
But which humans started this craze?
Well,

33
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,980
the Mesoamericans started writing
more than 2,900 years ago.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,420
Some Chinese characters,

35
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:20,400
or at least 3,200 years old writing
popped up in Crete 4,000 years ago.

36
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,200
But the two clear contenders are Egyptian
hieroglyphs and Sumerian cuneiform.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,340
Both a whopping 5,000 years old minimum.

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,540
It's common to say that the Egyptian
stole the idea of writing from Mesopotamia

39
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,070
and just came up with their own glyphs.

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,380
Common but not demonstrated for a while.
Mana genesis made sense.

41
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,580
This is the idea that one civilization
was king of all the writing.

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,100
That writing started once in Mesopotamia,

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,490
where people pressed a stylist in
a wet clay to make these wedge.

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,100
Cutaneous shapes,
forms cuneiform,

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,880
so the Mana Genesis story goes,

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,760
everyone else steals cuneiform
and re it to fit their own needs.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,160
It's not a popular story these days.

48
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,360
Given what we know about Chinese and
especially Mesoamerican writing along with

49
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,190
some very early Egyptian fines,

50
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,080
whoever's first in these early days
of writing all the civilizations start

51
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:17,530
manufacturing hordes of logo graphs.
So many in fact,

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,360
that they unwittingly unleash an epic
memory burden on budding locog refers from

53
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,600
would be ancient scribes to beginning
students of Mandarin Chinese.

54
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,750
Do they really need this many characters
to write? Surely there's an easier way.
