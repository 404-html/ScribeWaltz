00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,400
Welcome back to my series,

2
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,180
exploring the various ways that
sounds change over time and languages.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,350
I'd like to wrap up these videos
with the look at rules and laws.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,510
When someone identifies a regular sound
change pattern in language or from

5
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,790
parent to daughter
languages across history,

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,110
that pattern is traditionally
called a sound. Long key.

7
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:37,111
Laws are named after their discovers
or popularizer like grims law laws may

8
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:43,360
involved Llanishen dissimilation or any
of the sound changed types mentioned in

9
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:44,320
previous videos.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,310
So grims law defines a systematic
sound change in [inaudible] manic,

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,800
the parent of every Germanic language
from Icelandic to German to Gothic to

12
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:58,720
English. Part of grins law
involves d voicing of voice stops.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,880
So the pro Indo European or root
Gwyn turned into Quinn woman,

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,370
the English cognitives Queen.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:07,850
Yeah,

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,500
we can write that particular rule.

17
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,820
As waste stops become voiceless,

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,850
stops grims law and other sound
laws are built out of rules.

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,170
These rules are the conventional way that
historical linguists state how sounds

20
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:27,620
change in the language.
The basic formula is simple.

21
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,960
Give the sounds that change the
sounds that they change into and the

22
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:37,370
environments where that change
takes place. So in Portuguese,

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,330
the letter s is pronounced
between two valves,

24
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,940
like in the word cosmos.

25
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,050
Here's the rule notation that tells us
interval Kalik s it's pronounced zoo in

26
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,190
that environment,

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,040
and here is the rule that voiced
stops in pro Indo European turned into

28
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:05,070
voiceless stops in dramatic
regardless of environment,

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,620
the order in relationship of rules
is crucial for understanding their

30
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:14,250
significance in the development
of a language. For instance,

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,450
you can use your understanding of rules
to establish a relative chronology,

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,890
meaning that you can determine
which changes took place
earlier than others in a

33
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:27,300
languages history.
Let's imagine a simple human language.

34
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,790
We'll give it a cool name.
Like x x underwent two minors,

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,800
sound shifts in one shift and
became em before a label consonant.

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,420
This language has the labels,
P and F in other words,

37
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,910
and assimilates to a following Lavia

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,360
in the second shift, a short
unstressed, it was deleted,

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,310
but only if it occurred
between two consonants. In
other words, unstressed, Eh,

40
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,030
undergo syncopy.
NowX has a word aim fee.

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,020
Comparing data from
closely related languages.

42
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,320
Just as we did in the introduction
to historical linguistics,

43
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,850
we've been able to reconstruct the
pro form of that word as Unifi.

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,850
Now that I've given you this info,

45
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,570
tell me which sound change happened first,

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,080
deleting or changing and to m to
help you answer that question.

47
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,050
Let's build rules for
the two sound changes.

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,380
First end becomes em before a
consonant with the feature label.

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,390
Second unstressed,

50
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,810
it becomes nothing when
it's between two consonants.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,170
If the Prodo word is yen,

52
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:49,171
if she then applying rule one first
leaves us with Oh fee since end doesn't

53
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,140
assimilate to a following consonant,

54
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,170
it comes before vow but then we'll
to applies leaving us with yen fee.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,610
But language x has yin fee,
not yen fee.

56
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,450
So

57
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,450
Rach that try the reverse order rule two
turns Unifi into yen fee and now rule

58
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:17,720
one can apply. Leaving us with yen
fee, which is exactly what we find.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,160
So it looks like rule to
took place before rural one,

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,350
which is our relative chronology.

61
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,610
This fictitious but credible example from
language x raises awareness about not

62
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:34,310
only the timeline of rules
but the order of those rules.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,100
When an earlier rule creates
an environment in which
a later rule can operate.

64
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,690
The two rules are said to have a
relationship described as a feeding order.

65
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,110
There earlier rule feeds
into the second one.

66
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,860
So in language x rule number one which
deleted it allowed rule number two which

67
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:56,990
changed and to m to apply.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,150
That's an example of a feeding direction.
When the rules are reversed,

69
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,830
the earlier rule abandoned and environment
which is filled by little later rule,

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,470
the result is a counter feeding order.

71
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,100
Let's imagine that early in its history,

72
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:17,720
our language x had a rule that
deleted em before a consonant,

73
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,310
any consonant whatsoever.
The parent language had a word lump fee,

74
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,850
but this first rule and becomes nothing
between a vowel and a consonant applied

75
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,520
to that Prodo word giving the output
left fee in language x a later rule.

76
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,010
The one we're already familiar
with changed end to em
before a label consonant.

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,370
So rule one deleted am's before consonant,
but rural to put them right back in,

78
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,430
not in the same words,
but it recreated the environment.

79
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,000
When an earlier rule creates
an environment in which a
later rule cannot operate

80
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,190
the two rules in a bleeding order.
The outcome, the first rule applies,

81
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,030
and the second one doesn't
go back to language x,

82
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,860
which has a rule that deletes m
after a vowel, but before a constant.

83
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,420
It was this rule that changed the
Prodo word lump fee. Two left feet.

84
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,430
Young speakers of x are
applying a new rule these days.

85
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,640
They Insert have pee in
the consonant cluster,

86
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,350
m f so instead of saying they say,

87
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,130
but they fail to apply rule number two
to laugh fee which lost its cluster MF

88
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,760
thanks to rule number one,

89
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,450
when the bleeding rules are reversed,
the earlier rule operates,

90
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,830
followed by the later role,

91
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,680
which would have prevented the
earlier rule from applying.

92
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,120
The result is a counter bleeding order.
The outcome here is different.

93
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,540
Both rules apply returned to our rule in
language x that deletes and unstressed,

94
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,830
Eh,
in the middle of a word.

95
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,600
But here's a new rule that moves
stress to the pen ultimate.

96
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,850
The second to last syllable of a word.

97
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,480
That first role helped turn
Jenny feet into Yemen fee,

98
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,560
but it also caused the
word off the SA to change,

99
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:20,561
to offset this new accent shift moves
the stress to the first syllable,

100
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,150
resulting in the modern word off.

101
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,190
So instead of off side had
a Fisa change to our Fisa,

102
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,570
it would have prevented the rule
that deletes that unstressed, eh,

103
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,290
but since it happens second, the two rules
apply in a counter bleeding direction.

104
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,080
This series has taken the time to
share types of sound changes with you,

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,610
as well as how to state those sound
changes using phonological rules.

106
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,660
I appreciate your interest and your
attention throughout the series,

107
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,820
and I thank you for taking
the time to learn with me.
