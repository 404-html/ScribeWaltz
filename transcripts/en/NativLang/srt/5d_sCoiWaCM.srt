1
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,910
Allophone and minimal parents.

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,410
You're going to need those concepts to
start examining the phonology of Latin

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,650
American Spanish.
We'll start with minimal pairs,

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,130
which will allow us to document
the phoneme inventory of Spanish.

5
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,210
Such an inventory should contain
all major contrasting phonemes.

6
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,770
Here are five words that differ minimally
be so basal basle puzzle puzzle.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,190
We can infer that e a r
o n o r vowel phonemes.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,320
If we compare to other words, we'd find
that this holds up other minimal pairs.

9
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:55,280
Confirm that these five vowels are
distinct from one another and that there

10
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,240
isn't a sixth or a seventh foul beyond
these five that contrasts with them.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Next we'll move on to diphthongs Spanish
diphthongs start or end with the high

12
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:08,060
vowels so he or Ooh,

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,280
here we'll find examples of free variation
since the diphthongs sometimes have a

14
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,640
short vowel e or Ooh, but other times
have a more restricted glide. Yeah,

15
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,690
or what Gwyn that or Quinta qual or
quant CN or seeing the Gfsi or Gaussi.

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,460
If we turn to focus on the consonants,

17
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:35,630
we find many minimal pairs demonstrating
that Spanish as far more consonant

18
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:39,800
phonemes than vowel phonemes and
if we keep comparing minimal pairs,

19
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,510
we'll have a list of how many and what
kind of consonant phonemes Spanish has.

20
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,310
At that point we can drop a table of all
those consonants arranged by place of

21
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,280
articulation,
manner of articulation and voicing.

22
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,970
I'm sure you remember those terms
from the IPA for language learning,

23
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:58,400
but if not head back to
those lessons for review.

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,940
Now we have a tidy answer
to the basic question.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How many different sounds of Spanish
have we answered that by finding minimal

26
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:07,910
pairs,

27
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,910
Spanish words that differ by only one
sound lead us to think that these are all

28
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,630
different sounds in Spanish.

29
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,050
Phonemes contrast with each other. At
least they did an arm, minimal pairs,

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
but what about sounds that don't contrast
as you listen more closely to Latin

31
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,141
American Spanish,

32
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:31,250
you'll notice that the pronunciation of
many of these phonemes varies depending

33
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,180
on context.

34
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,680
You'll hear and pronounced
aim in embodies,

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,450
but not in.
In Hispana you'll hear Gusto,

36
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,980
but not a disaster.

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,490
But you'll hear gas
asto and not get Gusto.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,070
You'll hear dwelling, but not the
way late. And you'll hear ms Wally,

39
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,010
but not mid dwelling.
You'll hear Baca and not Laka,

40
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,480
but you'll hear Lavacca and not blah.
On the other hand,

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,520
you'll hear some speakers say Kylie
and others say Kylie. Some will say,

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,500
may Jamo and others made jam and
some Mucho, but others Musha.

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,100
What do these allophones suggest about
the pronunciation system of Spanish?

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,750
Come back next time to expand
your understanding of phonology.

45
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,400
Yeah.
