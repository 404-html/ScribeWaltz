1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,120
Some languages have freakishly long words.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,110
Hawaiian driver's licenses have
literally chopped off people's names.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,610
When ancient comedians spelled out this
mystery meat dish and German words can

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,570
get so hefty that even when they lost
their longest one in 2013 it hardly left a

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,380
dent.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,670
So what's going on and these words
and just how long can a word get?

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,390
A couple of years ago, I was living the
life chained to a desk, 10 hours a day,

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:31,230
working weekends, taking lunch breaks
to go snorkel with turtles in the reef.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,130
Oh, did I not mention I was
chained to a desk in Hawaii,

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,630
so I had a good swim and I'm walking
back and I must have zoned out on the

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,181
scenery,

12
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:43,650
eve singing with the birds or something
because somewhere I took a wrong turn

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,790
and now I am face to face with the
street sign that never quits. Seriously,

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:52,320
those letters went on forever. If
you're a normal human in this situation,

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,170
you know you're lost. You turn
around and you walk the other way.

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,310
But language nerds, we drop our ice cream
and sit there mesmerized by phonemes.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,351
Oh wait,

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,420
you think a lone male goes wandering
the streets looking at ice cream cone?

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,210
That is creepy. No, we'd shave ice.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,660
The kicker though is if you
pop open a Hawaiian dictionary,

21
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:13,050
you won't find these forever
words. In fact, most terms,

22
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,860
we'll look downright short. So where
are the extra letters coming from?

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,110
Hanging out with me long enough.

24
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:23,700
And you'll hear about Pacific island
taboos in Hawaii. The word is couple. Oh,

25
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,250
and there are some intriguing copper
stories, but that's for later.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,070
So keep capule.
But now go and grab this sounds hollow,

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,380
which my grammar book calls a causative,

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,690
smashed that onto Capua
and you'll get whole.

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,230
It'd be make something
holy or cause to be taboo.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,970
But these affixes only bias a few
characters and they give me grammatical

31
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,750
headaches.

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,130
So no big wins here besides most Hawaiian
grammar is done with separate little

33
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,450
words called particles.

34
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,890
And if you thought dissecting
word beasts was a pain,

35
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,250
here's your chance to tame a bunch
of little scurrying word insets.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,360
So beautiful though.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,230
But what's better than taking your base
word and growing it by sticking on some

38
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:06,090
appendages. Adding another base
word. This is called compounding.

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,440
Edit a you some serious extra letters.
What she got got a brain.

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,100
How about a lightening brain dumb.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,940
Here's some Pele dog trigger fish.

42
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,170
Why not a blunt pig snout trigger fish.
[inaudible]

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,480
pressive word building Hawaii.

44
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,020
So then it's Hawaii home
to the longest word ever.

45
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,720
It is not.

46
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,070
What about German or Greek from earlier?
Same strategy.

47
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,340
Compound compound compound. No
record breakers. They're either,

48
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,330
unfortunately the award
goes to Durham role,

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,990
a master compounder, extraordinary.
A 16th century writer, Fetal Mulamba.

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,960
She used compounding in her sand script
masterwork in which there is an entire

51
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,970
chapter devoted to basically just saying,

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,290
so this guy pass through a part of Tamil
Nadu but she gushed over that region.

53
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,760
I mean she really laid it on thick one.

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,590
Just one of the litany of flowery Sanskrit
words she use to describe the place

55
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,590
contains dozens and dozens of compounds,

56
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,520
and that is how a sense grid compound
made the Guinness World Records for

57
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,480
longest word.

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,220
And we having a moment here is that
thought crossing your mind to like,

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,881
theoretically,

60
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:22,390
couldn't we just keep adding and
adding hyphenated compounds infinitely.

61
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,580
Hope you're right. Kind of
unfair then, Huh? If that's
how we're playing this, fine.

62
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,620
It's a hyphenated verbal arms race.

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,600
The thing about words like these is
they don't really get used. Truth is,

64
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,830
even with compounding,

65
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:39,970
Hawaiian and German and even Sanskrit
aren't winning any average word length

66
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,100
awards around the world.

67
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:46,420
Languages where people actually use long
words and nearly every single sentence,

68
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,110
oh, they build words very differently.
She'd come back to that sometime.

69
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,110
Stick around and subscribe for language.
