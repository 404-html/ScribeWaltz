1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,673
Uh,

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,283
yeah.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,970
When you're arguing a point using logic,

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,640
you establish the premise
seeds to support a conclusion,

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,390
but many times your conclusion doesn't
actually follow from your line of

6
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:25,930
reasoning.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,750
No matter how much you or your opponent
are convinced by your argument.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,010
In that case,

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,430
you may be relying on a fallacy to
persuade yourself and your opponent.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,170
This word fallacy sounds charged and can
certainly get tossed from side to side,

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,010
decided heated debates, but in logic of
fallacy is merely a descriptive term.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,880
It says nothing about how dumb you are
nor about whether or not there exists

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,710
some real way to support the same
conclusion. Let me show you how it works.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,460
I made an argument in the previous
video demonstrating that coffee isn't to

15
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:57,070
beverage but a food.
In this argument,

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,420
I relied on two distinct meanings of the
word coffee and two different meanings

17
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,310
of the word beans in my premises.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,750
I was intentionally vague and used
compact language to hide these choices.

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,740
The simple language makes the argument
much more convincing than if I disclosed

20
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:14,320
the intended meaning of these words.
The result,

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,320
the conclusion looks like it
follows from the premises,

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,700
but it's really not supported by them.
The conclusion may or may not be true,

23
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:22,990
but it's uncalled for here.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,430
This reliance on the
psychological persuasiveness
of a statement is a hallmark

25
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,140
feature of informal fallacies,

26
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,160
which are informal because
the truthfulness of the
conclusions content can't be

27
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,890
derived from the truthfulness
of the content of the premises.

28
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,330
Still the arguments for may be perfectly
valid. Like my food is coffee syllogism.

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,180
Here's some examples
of informal fallacies.

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,253
Okay.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Hm Hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,063
hm

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,213
hm.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,520
The list goes on it all cases,
informal fallacies,

35
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,810
rely of content that does something other
than support the conclusion in order

36
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:40,610
to get you to accept the conclusion,

37
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,240
you can get a feel for how the logic
of the supporting line of reasoning

38
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:48,110
actually runs. If you just remove
the fallacious statement like this,

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,551
not so reasonable.

40
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:54,050
Now is it recall that arguments
don't just have content.

41
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,280
They also have form.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
We called an argument with well
structured premises into conclusion.

43
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,510
So it may not surprise you to hear of
a formal fallacies which arise when we

44
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:07,570
shape the argument in a way
that the conclusion doesn't
follow from the premises.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,590
But people can still be persuaded by the
conclusion because it seems to follow.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,460
Let's play around with a few arguments
to see if you can spot weaknesses in

47
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,150
their form in their
structure. First, a refresher,

48
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,340
a basic syllogism. A is
B, B is c, so a is c.

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,680
Fill it in as you like. We've
seen that this form works. Next,

50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,510
a second point of reference and an
even simpler argument if p then Q,

51
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,210
p,
therefor Q.

52
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,420
This is a basic reasoning strategy
and it works. What about this one?

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,430
A is not B. B is not
c. Therefore a is. See,

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,320
think about it for a moment and check
against other examples if you need to.

55
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,160
The first premise only
supports that a is not B.

56
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,780
So anything we say about being the second
premise can't apply to a positively or

57
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:06,070
negatively. The conclusion
doesn't follow. This.

58
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:10,150
Next one runs aground on the same
issue as the last. A is not B.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,060
So no matter what we say about B,
it doesn't apply to a

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,150
what's wrong here. I've negated
P in this conditional statement,

61
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,580
then assumed that Q must also be negated,

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,730
but perhaps Q is conditioned
on something else.

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,560
Spot the problem here
yet. No, look closer.

64
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,470
Keep looking because you won't find it.

65
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,310
This one's good and I leave it to you
and your clever ways to figure out why.

66
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,223
One more for you.

67
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,710
Can I argue that what follows from a
conditional implies what proceeds consider

68
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,920
this form carefully.

69
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,900
A implies B only states that
if a holds B also holds,

70
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,430
it does not mean that.
Be always follows from a come on.

71
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,560
You remember your logical by conditionals,
right?

72
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,080
That's all for fallacies. Well,
for this introduction to fallacies,

73
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,670
I'm sure you will encounter plenty more.

74
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,110
These last two topics introduced arguments
and fallacies and I'll add them to my

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,580
playlist for the intro to logic.
