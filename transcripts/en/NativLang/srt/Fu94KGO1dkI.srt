00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,200
This series of videos,

2
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:50,340
we'll explore the basic grammar of
the romance languages by comparing and

3
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,980
contrasting late Latin
and its descendants.

4
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,570
This first video is a short introduction
providing some general thoughts before

5
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,860
we just jump right in.

6
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,603
Yeah,

7
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,150
the Roman Empire Spread Latin
as it conquered it's way
throughout ancient Europe.

8
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,390
Local popular forms of Latin collectively
called Vulgar Latin developed over the

9
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:37,431
centuries changing as languages do into
a variety of languages and dialects

10
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,970
across the continent.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,290
Some of these languages even spread
across the globe and continued to develop

12
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,910
far from their original homes.

13
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,710
Nowadays there are five major
romance languages, French, Spanish,

14
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,270
Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian.
Those are probably names you recognize,

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,980
but there are other regional languages
like Sicilian and Katelyn and extinct

16
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:05,120
languages like Dalmatian that give us a
more complete picture of this language

17
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:05,954
family.

18
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,910
So what is a comparative grammar of
the Romance Languages? Very briefly,

19
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,130
a grammar is how a language works.

20
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,980
So a romance grammar will tell you,

21
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,680
we're giving you an idea of
how the romance languages work.

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,650
This grammar will be comparative because
instead of just looking at individual

23
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,130
languages like just
French or only Spanish,

24
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,210
we'll explore examples from
multiple languages in each topic.

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,153
Okay?

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Throughout this series, I'm going
to display examples on your screen,

27
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,460
vulgar Latin examples.
We'll start with an asterisk.

28
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,470
That little star is going to tell you
that vulgar Latin words are reconstructed.

29
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,860
They come from a mostly
undocumented form of Latin.

30
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,150
If you want to learn how extinct
undocumented languages are reconstructed,

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,140
I share a lot more in a separate series
covering the basics of historical

32
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,950
linguistics. I'll put a link to
that below. Here's one example.

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,000
Classical Latin writers used.
Look, Ward four I speak,

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,130
but some late Latin speakers started
saying Bonobo and others started saying

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,260
fall below four I speak instead.

36
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,510
Examples in languages other than Latin
in the modern romance languages start

37
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,570
with an asterisk.
When they offer negative evidence.

38
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,890
Negative examples are reasonable
structures that tend not to show up in a

39
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:43,670
language. For example, English
speakers say my language,

40
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,130
but don't really say the my language.

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,160
Well in Italian the
opposite is actually true,

42
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,980
but don't take my word for these really.

43
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,180
You can get a taste of the frequency
of any of these examples by starting to

44
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,070
search for similar structures online.

45
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,270
Positive examples should come up a lot
more frequently than negative ones.

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,270
If the negative rate even
returns any results at all.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,810
Okay,
let's divide romance words up.

48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,740
We'll split them up based on whether
or not each word has different forms.

49
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,640
In English,
the word hat as a plural form hats,

50
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,940
these kinds of words are variable.

51
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Other words like two in to a party are
invariable in the romance languages.

52
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:32,180
Content, words like nouns and
verbs can very well function.

53
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:35,780
Words like prepositions and
conjunctions tend not to vary,

54
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,480
so how do variable words very not
in any old way, variable words,

55
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,520
very in a very specific way.

56
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,080
They have a base that carries the
meaning like this Spanish base

57
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,820
we call this basis stem endings attached
to the end of this stem and often carry

58
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,230
some grammatical information.

59
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,720
That Spanish stem fluke deal and
can be used in the verb. When Fiona,

60
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,550
it works, it works, and so on.

61
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,200
We'll treat these variations as
different forms of the same word,

62
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,300
not as completely different words.

63
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,880
Let's build on these ideas in upcoming
lessons as we start to look into how

64
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:30,420
nouns, verbs, pronouns,
adjectives, and adverbs,

65
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:33,420
particles and sentences work
in the romance languages.

66
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,960
I'm really excited to start
sharing some examples with you.

67
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,140
You're going to meet some
very cool languages and get
a good sense for how this

68
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,760
family works. Ballet.
That's good. Bye for now,

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,500
and I look forward to next time.
