1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,110
Etymology and homology
explores the history and
development of individual words,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,020
the origins of a languages,
lexical items.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,970
It asks a question you're likely familiar
with that question is where did this

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:15,804
word come from?

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,910
You've probably encountered etymologies
when someone explained the meaning of a

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:25,890
word or when you sought out the origin
of a word for yourself as a linguistic

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,350
study.
This question is approached methodically,

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,160
so it requires that we understand the
methods that we'll use to discover word

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:37,161
origins specifically at homology
requires an understanding of the parts of

10
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,740
words, their pronunciation
and grammar components.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,700
So you'll need some understanding
of phonology and morphology.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,270
Etymology is also a diachronic process.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,800
What this means is that etymology is a
function of a language is change over

14
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,950
time.
So etymology will make more sense if you,

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,100
if you're already versed in the
fundamentals of historical linguistics,

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,970
if you're aware of key concepts
like cognates and borrowings,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,440
reconstruction of Poteau languages and
discussions about what is a language and

18
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:12,300
what is a dialect, we can
start to build etymologies, uh,

19
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,070
for the etymology of a particular word.

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,150
We'll need to know about language change
over time in general and the history of

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
change in a particular
language that we're analyzing.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,350
We'll also need to know the history of
borrowing a bard words are called lone

23
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:29,790
words or loans, uh, borrowing
into that particular language.

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,350
And in turn the historical changes that
those source languages that were the

25
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,060
source of the borrowings underwent.

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,010
Notice that words are often borrowed or
inherited from non standard forms of a

27
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,610
language. And that adds to the
complexity. Take for instance,

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,200
a medieval Norman French borrowings into
middle English, like the word chief,

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,270
which is not the same as the modern French
word chef or the interesting case of

30
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,550
dialect mixing,
which accounts for the word pair,

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
shirt and skirt in modern English.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,070
So with those complexities in mind,

33
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,730
let's discuss how we trace the path
of a word as it sounded in its form.

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,520
Change as much as is possible,

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,670
we rely on historical attestation here.

36
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:16,230
We expect our etymology to account for
the evidence that is the word that we're

37
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,490
tracing as it was actually used
throughout its history. For example,

38
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:25,170
the modern English word queen goes back
to an earlier Cwayna in middle English.

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,170
This word is a tested in Chaucer Quain.
I in turn,

40
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,640
derives from old English
Quain attested in Beowulf.

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,030
Here we can say that the Edelman or
source word of queen is the old English

42
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,400
Kwame, but we aren't restricted
by the attested evidence.

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,760
There are two ways to trace
a more distant origin. First,

44
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:49,110
we might discover that a
word was influenced by or
borrowed from another dialect

45
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,830
or another language like English were
chief, which was borrowed from French.

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,690
In this case, our etymology can continue
in that source language. Second,

47
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:01,780
we can increase our time by comparing
related languages and engaging in the

48
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,880
process of historical reconstructions.

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,720
A clever intellectual development I
introduced in the lesson on historical

50
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,930
linguistics. Therefore,
as much as possible,

51
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,530
our etymology we'll take into account
the history of borrowing it influence and

52
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,100
will terminate at the earliest
reconstructible form of a word,

53
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,180
not the earliest attested form.
For example,

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,710
the old English word Quain can be compared
to other early dramatic words like

55
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:31,630
the Gothic quaint's or the old Norse
fen allowing us to reconstruct a produce

56
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:36,631
dramatic ancestral form as Quen is when
we compare the pro dramatic word to

57
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:41,650
cognates in other nondramatic Indo
European languages like the ancient Greek

58
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,410
word Janae and the Sanskrit [inaudible],

59
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,860
we can begin to reconstruct a pro to
Indo European root like goon or Gwen will

60
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:55,030
then see that grims law applies to
all Germanic languages, which changed.

61
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:57,170
Voiceless stops to uh,

62
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,230
fricatives and voice stops to voiceless
stops giving us a route, Quinn,

63
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:06,810
beginning with the voiceless sound
k rather than the voice, GI or gut.

64
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,360
Know when I said that grims law
applies to all dramatic languages,

65
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,360
that doesn't mean that it
still impacts modern languages,

66
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,380
but like all sound laws,
it effected words at one point in history.

67
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,300
In this case in pro dramatic.
So let's review what we've done here.

68
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,730
We found the earliest attested form of
queen and English compared to two words

69
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,320
in related Germanic languages.

70
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:34,230
To trace the word to a reconstructed
proto dramatic word and compared produ

71
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,610
dramatic to relate it
into European languages.

72
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:40,720
To trace the word even further back to
a reconstructed prodo Indo European root

73
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,890
word. Along the way, we paid
attention to sound changes.

74
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,890
Notice that you'll find an asterisk next
to reconstruct it forms and also notice

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,210
how the derivational path
is represented visually. Uh,

76
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,410
Gwen is becomes queen,

77
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,910
which becomes Cwayna or
[inaudible] comes from Queen,

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,620
which comes from Quinn is

79
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,580
it's also crucial to
understand morphology,

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,680
to know what kind of
word you're dealing with.

81
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,860
Especially key here is word formation.

82
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,190
The way affixes are added
to routes to form new words,

83
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,120
which is derivation or how words
are compounded to form new words,

84
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:23,620
which is compounding. Inflectional
morphemes are certainly considered,

85
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,220
but they're really part of the
grammar or structure of a language.

86
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,570
While etymology often focuses on content,
words or content morphemes.

87
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,560
Um, an example of why morphology
matters when doing etymology,

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,870
when we traced the history of Queen, we
arrived at a pro dramatic word. Quen is,

89
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,010
which has an inflectional
suffix is attached to the root.

90
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,860
Now in a separate instance,

91
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:50,920
you might be doing the etymology
of say the word illogical,

92
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,640
that re that word has a root Logue
and three derivational affixes,

93
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,200
a suffix, a suffix. Oh,

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,360
and a prefix in which assimilated too
ill to do justice to the etymology of

95
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,061
these words.

96
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:08,360
You'll need to understand and know
the derivation of these morphemes.

97
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,000
In the next video,
I'll talk about the role of semantics,

98
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,460
particularly meaning change in etymology.

99
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,810
And I'll also touch on basic conventions
followed when presenting an etymology.

100
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,600
Hope this has been helpful and see them.
