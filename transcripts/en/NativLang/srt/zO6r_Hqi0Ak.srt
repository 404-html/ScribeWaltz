1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,760
When the alphabet first popped
up in the Mediterranean.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,040
It was a single scratchy list of letters,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,540
but no European alphabets have not
one but two symbols for each letter.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,630
One big upper case and
one little lower case.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,010
So I hear you ask why the
extra complications. How
did this resizing happen?

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,100
Gaze now with these sternly romantic,

7
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:24,540
Latin and Greek inscriptions with their
textured words that sink shallowly into

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:29,520
they're crumbling slabs. They look like
epitaphs for an ancient civilization,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,440
but narrow your aesthetic focus and look
only at the letters. What do you notice?

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,070
Capital Letters.
It's all capital letters,

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,430
big imposing monumental capital letters.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,750
Even when they took up softer media
writing on puff virus and parchment,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,230
the Greeks and Romans pen their
words with these big letters,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,260
this magic school script that's right
century's worth of all caps rage.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,250
But the rise and reign of Christendom
brought with it the ascent of the book and

16
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,340
booksmith scribes with ink
flowing from their pens.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,680
The large sharp angles of older scripts
gave way to smaller rounder fluid forms.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,210
In the late seven hundreds Charlemagne
invited the scholar Alquan of York to his

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:12,870
court.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,800
And this man shaped up the king's scribes
developing and teaching what we know

21
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,610
is Carolingian minuscule,
the most celebrated early Latin,

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,750
minuscule or lowercase script.
Around the same time,

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,010
Greek writers came up with
our own running cursive.

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,010
Handful of smaller miniscule letters
to Byzantine Greek had a particularly

25
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,310
strong minuscule tradition,
which dominated it's manuscripts.

26
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,600
For a thousand years, Latin and
Greek weren't traveling alone here,

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,890
Greek brothers Cyril and Methodius
tweaked their alphabet to make it suitable

28
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:48,150
for old Bulgarian in the eight hundreds
and so they gave birth to the cyrillic

29
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,500
alphabet.
Now,

30
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,520
cyrillic never developed the kind of
very distinct lowercase forums found in

31
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,960
Latin and Greek manuscripts,

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,320
but eventually it did distinguish
smaller and larger letter types.

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,210
Now at this point in our story,

34
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:04,680
notice that uppercase scripts and
lowercase scripts are different scripts.

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,800
We're not really mixing magic
skills with Munis skills here.

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,590
When did the modern mixing
start by cameral scripts,

37
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,400
ones that treat uppercase and lowercase
as variants of the same letter.

38
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,020
We're still on the horizon.

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,400
You can get hints of the system and
old writings like those larger capital

40
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,340
decorated initials that adorned
medieval manuscripts, but by cameral,

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,140
uppercase plus lowercase became the
standard when language is written with

42
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,320
alphabet, settled on employing
minuscule for most texts,

43
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,830
but using the magic skill letters
to signal important information.

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,410
A big letter at the
beginning of a sentence,

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,510
a big letter at the
beginning of a proper name.

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,760
We're even at the start of every single.

47
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:48,660
Now these have all been standards in
the history of English and the last one

48
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,740
still is for German, but not
all by cameral siblings. Agree.

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,410
Should you capitalize the name
of a foreign language or not?

50
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,960
Ken capital's fall in the middle of words.

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,360
Should you even capitalize the
first letter of every sentence?

52
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,190
Should you write some things entirely
in caps by cameral scripts don't have a

53
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,710
monopoly on different
forms for a single letter.

54
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,740
Maybe we'll save the details for another
day because I always like doing these

55
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,040
comparative of sides,
but think about Syriac and later,

56
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,470
but very similar to Syriac Arabic.

57
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,800
These cursive scripts
don't have capital letters,

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,070
but each of their letters have
up to four distinct shapes.

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,540
Initial in the letter connects to the
start of other letters medial when it

60
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,490
connects between two letters final,

61
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,160
when the letters connected to the
end of of their letters in isolated,

62
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,790
when it's all alone, there's even a
cool acronym for these. They're in fees,

63
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,230
scripts,
and well,

64
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,231
sometimes the difference between IMF I
forms is pretty small in scripts that are

65
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:47,740
as maniacally cursive is Syriac in Arabic,
it's very important.

66
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,960
So maybe by cameral in empty scripts
are both part of a broader phenomenon.

67
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,000
How a single letter can have multiple
standard variants within a script,

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,240
but still be the same
letter in the same script.

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,260
It's interesting to think about. It's
a good question. Thanks for asking it.

70
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,560
But now that we've tackled the
uppercase and lowercase letter variants,

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,190
and now that the word by camera rolls
off your tongue and makes you sound even

72
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,810
smarter than you already were,

73
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,350
I want to move on to another
story of Latin letter variants.

74
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,360
It's a tale of ancient and
medieval letter modding. Modders.
