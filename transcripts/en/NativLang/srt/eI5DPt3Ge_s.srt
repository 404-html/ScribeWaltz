1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,510
Danish sounds odd,
like a throat condition,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,770
like Danes are holding back a cough or
maybe they got a potato stuck in their

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:11,940
throats. Apparently. At least
that's what everyone's telling me.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,170
But why?
Why does Danish sounds so funny to people?

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,940
I recently explored how Swedes,

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,810
Norwegians and Danes can all communicate
without having to switch languages.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,090
But this wasn't fair and
even some languages were more
intelligible than others.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,650
The Internet eagerly pointed his
finger at one language in particular.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,930
Danish did it. I posted a video and I'm
told that Danish is a throat condition.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,290
I log into social media and I read
about the potato in their throat.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,130
I go visit a discussion board
and it's a strangled goose.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,730
A study tells me Swedish kids here Danish
as uglier and stranger than Danes do

13
00:00:56,101 --> 00:01:00,600
Swedish. The sure some of this is
banter and good natured teasing,

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,210
but even taking it all with
a grain of salt, he herring.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,900
I still have to ask what
makes Danish sounds so funny.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,360
Maybe I could just add my own theory.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,720
I'll blame it on too much Danish
butter in there. Crigler but no,

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,440
this is native Lang. So you already
know what we're about to do.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,000
Sift through the history of Danish to
uncover what specifically about its

20
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,360
pronunciation makes it stand out.
Now,

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,290
Danish is notoriously hard to learn
to pronounce. You'll hear me try,

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,620
but somebody please back me up.
It may feel

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,170
okay.
Travel back in time.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
Once upon a 1300 years ago,

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Denmark was speaking in Indo European
dramatic language with a unique northern

26
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,390
flavor, which we call old Norse. To them,

27
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,890
it's the [inaudible] Tonga,

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,640
the Dane tongue throughout Scandinavia.

29
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:57,000
This is a time of unity.
Everywhere you go,

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,820
Norse sounds like Norse,

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,460
but soon these Dame Tanger's grow restless
and get upgraded to Viking status in

32
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:09,540
the Viking age. Something we'll
change. It starts in Denmark,

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,180
uh, Dane, probably many Danes,

34
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:17,100
but definitely this one decides I'm going
to start seeing my vols differently,

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,570
which leads east Norse to
split away from West Norse.

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,460
It's the start of a trend, the perfect
setup for the rest of our story.

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,960
Hey everybody.
Uh,

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,980
there was another sound change in
Denmark and at this point over a thousand

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,290
years ago, we can officially
call it Denmark, the Dane March.

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,270
See this rune stone says,

41
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:44,271
so the vikings settled down the
Middle Ages settle in at this point,

42
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,190
Scandinavia is a continuum of dialects
that smoothly trace their origins to east

43
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,150
and west.
Norse.

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,220
Oh and the too often forgotten old
goodness on its own island were valid

45
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:59,350
sometimes didn't agree with
either Norse West or east.

46
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,840
Officially though this is an era of Latin,

47
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,430
not too much written Norse until Denmark
decides to go medieval and ink this

48
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:14,061
scanning and law thanks to scribal
copying this law was available in multiple

49
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,930
versions,
including this awesome one in ruins.

50
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,560
It's words show off another Danish change
unstressed vowels are getting weaker.

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,180
This is how you're nicely distinguished
endings in Swedish and Norwegian.

52
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,420
We'll all end up in
Danish with uh, uh, uh,

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,610
meanwhile the Hanseatic league is
uniting to dominate the continents and

54
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:37,510
Northern Coast,

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,220
which brings a war and
many new words from middle,

56
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:47,110
low German or Middle Nether Dutch.
Also.

57
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,840
Meanwhile,
another change is happening in Denmark.

58
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,670
Consonants becoming softer,
like how to soften to Ah,

59
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,070
in math too.
Math,

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,070
this is Lynn [inaudible]. It's a
normal change. Just ask Spanish,

61
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,100
but weirdly Danes do it.
At the end of syllables,

62
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,250
consonants and unstressed.
Vowels are weakening,

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,690
but stressed vowels are
multiplying by count Danish,

64
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,400
we'll end up with more distinct vowels
than maybe any other language. Now,

65
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,300
this is a Danish that's getting different.
We're a Honda something,

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,410
but on the sounds funny scale so far,
I'd rate it a chuckle.

67
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,090
So far.

68
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,260
It's 1526 a Swede writes that Dane
sound like they want to cough,

69
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,130
turning words in their throats.
Arriving in ringing.

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,140
What is this?

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Throatiness we won't know for another
two centuries before a Danish grow.

72
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,680
Marian rights in the [inaudible] squint.
Hey,

73
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,650
at least my Latin works.
Also bolt title. Well,

74
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:58,240
this book describes how Danes pronounced
many syllables with a very little

75
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:01,300
hiccup,
a little hiccup with a bold name.

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,780
A punch shock or blast is a stove.

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,350
This punch to the throat isn't one sound.

78
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,570
It's sums up an entire process,

79
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,430
a complicated process with multiple
phases and a bunch of anatomy happening in

80
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,910
your throat.
It's not on every syllable either.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,860
These don't have it.

82
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,600
These ones do.
So yeah,

83
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,000
it's been called creaky cough like,

84
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,480
and let's not forget a constant
stream of tiny hiccups.

85
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,840
And it is crucial if you ever went to
master that genuine Danish accent at the

86
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,910
very moment,
this author's writing about hiccups.

87
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,050
There's another sound change in Denmark
this time for once though it's not

88
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,830
danishes fault.
Danish preserved a trilled Norse,

89
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,520
but now throughout France and Germany,

90
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,550
a new ar is spreading a
dramatic worth its own story.

91
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,230
The so called guttural, ah, instead
of a front of the tongue trill,

92
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,200
it's a back of the mouth.
Ahh,

93
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,750
Denmark cut a bad case of this bug whose
symptoms include turning words like as

94
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,150
into this

95
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,130
third results isn't even
throw to your Danish.

96
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
We're almost there almost because they
have all the rights sounds in Copenhagen,

97
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,870
but Scandinavia is still a
rich tapestry of dialects.

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Sweden will keep its many variants,
including a Swedish side form of goodness.

99
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,590
In Norway.
There's still no single spoken Norwegian,

100
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,800
but back in Denmark,
the old dialects,

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,510
some of which never even had that
stood will witness one last change.

102
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,050
Traditional dialects.
We'll mostly vanish.

103
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,670
We end up with nearly all of
Denmark speaking one language,

104
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,030
a language with the simplest
grammatical endings in Scandinavia.

105
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,410
We can consonants perhaps the largest
number of vowels in the world and little

106
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:05,900
hiccups in [inaudible],

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,780
and that is how the Danes went from
speaking north just as well as anybody to

108
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:15,050
sounding amazingly on harp,
oddly amazing.

109
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,920
Stick around and subscribe for language.
