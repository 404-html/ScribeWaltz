1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,990
Sorry.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,213
Texting.

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,100
Written language is just one of those
things that's always been around.

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,790
It's a natural way for you to use words.
It's a gimmick,

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,110
but there's something you've forgotten.
It's understandable after all.

6
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,610
It's been a very long time.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,743
Yeah,

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,080
a long time since no one on
the planet knew how to write.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,980
Our story starts with the legend, the
tale of thought. Often feminists. No,

10
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:56,590
that's not a list. Beer hearing, soften,

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,450
Themis south and Samis after the
Egyptian God thought and Vince writing,

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,190
he runs to Kink, famous to share
this discovery, but to his Chagrin,

13
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,020
the king isn't impressed at all.
Looking down his nose,

14
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:15,400
he starts pontificating on the destructive
power of this new fangled technology.

15
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,440
Oh,
clever thought.

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,880
This invention will produce forgetfulness
in the minds of learners with the

17
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,630
neglect of their memory because their
trust and writing comes from strange

18
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,510
external marks and not
their own internal recall.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,570
The drug you've discovered
isn't a memory enhancer,

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,870
but a mentioning enhancer
and you're offering students
pretend wisdom not truth.

21
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,550
This sounds strange.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,610
It's easy for you and your world
full of writing to dismiss them as,

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,883
but here I'm out.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,240
He brings you back to the early days of
writing when it was the hot new thing

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,770
and like many other inventions,
not everyone was on board. Okay,

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,640
so let's say for the sake of argument,
you don't want writing.

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,110
What are the alternative technologies
you could bust out your abacuses.

28
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,380
They'll help with counting and
doing complex calculations.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,150
Maybe you prefer icons,

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,050
ritualized images that help you relate
to culturally significant figures,

31
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,370
events and attitudes.

32
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,540
The Keith who is an amazing ink and
information storage system using cords,

33
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:20,590
colors and not, oh, and don't
overlook rope memorization.

34
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,240
Basic option,
sure.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,590
But it's really useful in preliterate
societies where sentences can be memorized

36
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:30,820
and recited by the thousands.
You're brain is bigger than you think.

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,740
Perhaps you prefer a petroglyphs rock
carvings with major cultural ties that may

38
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:39,460
refer to nearby places or
animals. Ooh, watch out writing.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,410
We're getting uncomfortably close.

40
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,620
All of these inventions helped
humans keep track of their thoughts.

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,490
So what makes writing different?
What's them as afraid of?

42
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,610
Let's talk some ness embeddedness.

43
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,440
These things are all embedded in minds.
Tasks, rituals, events, cultures,

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,390
rip them from those contexts and you
rip their expressive heart thoughts.

45
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,400
Drug doesn't come with
so many strings attached.

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,510
It will DM bed you letting you record
any specific thoughts and letting future

47
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:12,480
generations read it in any context.
So human was famous, right?

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,990
Is writing an unnatural intrusion
or do you want to swallow thoughts,

49
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:21,340
pill and see for yourself what we actually
unleashed when we invented writing?

50
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,663
Ooh,

51
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,260
La France,
17,000 years ago.

52
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,570
It's cold out and getting colder.
Possibly dangerous too.

53
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,040
This may be France and this
may be the history of writing,

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
but there's nothing for you here until
you take shelter in a nearby cave and see

55
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:54,970
how creative some of your ancestors
really were drawing on their enlarging

56
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,690
brains and a long prehistory of
building ever more complex tools.

57
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,350
These early artists took to etching
and painting beautiful visual

58
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:06,010
representations of the animals
around them. These aren't words,

59
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,580
they're not stories.
They're pictures early.

60
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,890
Pictures like these start
to become very routine,

61
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,300
not necessarily depicting the world,
but marking and standing for things.

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,410
A place to hunt,
a place to eat.

63
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,850
These are pictographs.
The story gets sketchy here,

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,630
but it's important to notice
that pictographic symbols
like these Petroglyphs,

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,870
rock carvings weren't words.
They weren't language,

66
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,710
but they became more than personal
and communal artistic expressions.

67
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,300
They became regular and repeatable,
possibly mapping to specific things.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,090
And for that,
these pictographs or in themselves,

69
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,460
the fancy label of Prodo writing,

70
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,880
many pictographs have an
intuitive giveaway quality.

71
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,920
They look like drawings of the things
they represent. Draw me a human easy.

72
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,120
Draw me a horse. Sure.
A river. There it is.

73
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,310
But how do you clearly and simply draw
less tangible ideas like playing around

74
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:06,940
or taking it easy or don't
even think about it. Uh Oh,

75
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,330
watch out for this major moments in
the history of writing meet metonymy.

76
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,320
This principled fellow lets you represent
a general nebulous idea with the

77
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:22,321
related pictogram or part of a pictogram
or a pictogram combo that's pretty

78
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:27,130
specific and obvious. Ancient stick
human is a regular old pictogram.

79
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,230
If you cut off sticks legs,

80
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,370
you can get across the general
idea of what walking, removing.

81
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,570
What about a man leaning against a tree?
What's the idea here?

82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,650
Taking it easy. Resting.
These are idiot graphs,

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,460
symbols for ideas and concepts.
In some sense,

84
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:50,380
all of these drawings express ideas,
the concept of a horse concept of a human,

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,510
so they're all idiographic but with a
little imagination and a lot of time

86
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,920
extended idiot graphs.

87
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:01,010
Let you've cut and combine basic
pictographs to be far more expressive and

88
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:01,844
abstract.

89
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,750
Just when you're ready to grab that
Chisel and get your pictographic and

90
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,830
idiographic carving on someone more
inventive than you comes along.

91
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,440
Your pictures and ideas
aren't enough for her.

92
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,610
Gone are the days of Lascaux the
world outside. This cave is changing.

93
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,490
She says crops, cities, rulers, markets,

94
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,000
and she needs a way to keep track
of it all. She likes your icons.

95
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,110
She can use them for goats and Potts
fields and even long walks through the

96
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,080
desert, but she has an
incredible practical streak.

97
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,740
She takes those goats in those
pots and starts to tally the items.

98
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,580
She's recording one goat,
she says. Then two goats,

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,300
three goats for goats.
Notice what she's done.

100
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,050
These aren't simple depictions anymore.
They're not just ideas.

101
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,850
She's reading one word for each symbol.
She's encoding language.

102
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,370
Let's slow down here because it's hard
to overstate the importance of this major

103
00:06:55,371 --> 00:07:00,200
moment in the history of writing
these goat counts or words,

104
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:04,490
symbols. Now, Loga graphs,
pictographs can be visualized.

105
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,230
Idiot graphs can be imagined,

106
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,530
but loga graphs can be directly and
consistently red logo graphics systems

107
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:16,520
emerge and flourish and
the early civilizations of
Mesopotamia, Egypt, China,

108
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,750
and Mexico, characters for
people, animals, land crops,

109
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,890
hundreds, even thousands of Loga graphs
for everything under the sun and moon,

110
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,090
including the sun and the moon.
Even after all these millennia,

111
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,150
if you squint hard enough,
you can still pick out the symbol,

112
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,510
scratching and weathered artifacts,
bearing the world's early scripts,

113
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,290
a Chinese turtle and Egyptian house,
a Sumerian head,

114
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,510
a Sumerian had eating bread, a Mayan
Jaguar, and in each of these places,

115
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,960
in all of these languages,
these were red as words.

116
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,530
We know what these Loma graphs mean
and we can put that meaning into words.

117
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,370
The world is now in a race to
fill itself with logo graphs,

118
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,400
but which humans started this craze?
Well,

119
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,790
the Mezo American started writing
more than 2,900 years ago.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,830
Some Chinese characters or at least 3,200
years old writing popped up and creat

121
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,100
4,000 years ago,
but the two clear contenders,

122
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,980
our Egyptian hieroglyphs
and Sumerian cuneiform,

123
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,150
both a whopping 5,000 years old minimum.

124
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,320
It's common to say that the Egyptian
stole the idea of writing from Mesopotamia

125
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,910
and just came up with their own glyphs.

126
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,190
Common but not demonstrated for a while.
Mana genesis made sense.

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,390
This is the idea that one civilization
was king of all of the writing.

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,890
That writing started once in Mesopotamia
where people pressed a stylist in a wet

129
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,030
clay to make these wedge Kunis shapes,
forms,

130
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,690
cuneiform,
so the monogenic this story goes,

131
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,590
everyone else steals cuneiform and
re skins it to fit their own needs.

132
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,960
It's not a popular story these days.

133
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,170
Given what we know about
Chinese and especially Mezo
American writing along with

134
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:56,010
some very early

135
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,390
Egyptian fines, whoever's first
in these early days of writing,

136
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,050
all of the civilizations start
manufacturing hordes of logo graphs.

137
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,930
So many in fact that they unwittingly
unleash an epic memory burden on budding

138
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:12,750
look og refers from would be ancient
scribes to beginning students of Mandarin.

139
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:16,380
Chinese, do they really need
this many characters to write?

140
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,570
Surely there's an easier way.

141
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,983
Okay.

142
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,070
Say hello to this smart rogue who's about
to solve your problem with an innocent

143
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:33,904
mistake.

144
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,100
His father has been counting
sheep literally and he just
asked his son to record

145
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,600
a measly line in his budget.

146
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,200
10 sheep for uncle the son writes the 10
and the logo graph for sheep but uncle

147
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,490
he pauses and scratches his head
eager to play with his friends.

148
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:55,150
He writes the character
for ankle 10 sheep ankle.

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,560
He hurries away without a second thought
but don't take his invention lightly.

150
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,160
If you've ever played fill in the blank
or guessing games where you have to

151
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:07,510
sound out picture words you've seen and
used this principle for yourself but

152
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:11,440
it's not just for quirky puzzles with
funny so we've shortened the name for this

153
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:15,160
is another major moments
in the history of writing.

154
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,710
The name for this is is rebuilt.

155
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,000
This familiar language game lets you look
beyond the meaning of a character and

156
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:26,710
use it simply for its sound. Son.
Sounds like sun and by extension,

157
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:31,711
perhaps soon and sewn loga graphs like
the symbol for Sun could already be read

158
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:34,630
his words. Now with the rebus
principle in your pocket,

159
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,450
look at graphs can also be read as sounds.

160
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,410
This isn't just useful for getting
ancient uncle his ancient sheet.

161
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,340
Once as tech city planners finish building
their stunning capital in the middle

162
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,640
of a lake, the Venice of the
new world, keynotes teeth, Lon,

163
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,040
their scribes needed a
weight of right it's name.

164
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,310
They've been using what amounts
to basic picture of writing.

165
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,840
Since [inaudible] has a
stone Tay and a cactus,

166
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,920
naturally it's natural to write
it with two fairly obvious glyphs.

167
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,550
Then these become not just symbols,
meaning cactus in stone,

168
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,340
but symbols for the
noises they noche de land,

169
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,050
making them just as much Redis fun as
those puzzles you solve as a kid and now

170
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:15,220
you know the name for those.

171
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,270
You also know why there's a cactus on
top of a stone in Mexico. His flag,

172
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,890
it's not just for show.

173
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,390
How alike does this sound
like pronunciation have to be,

174
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,920
which sounds can we chop off pit
the Egyptians against the Sumerians?

175
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:30,790
One more time.

176
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,920
Egyptian hieroglyphs cut off the initial
consonant or less often two or three

177
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,800
continents from the
original word Sumerians.

178
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:42,700
On the other hand with their cuneiform,
take whole syllables.

179
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,760
These two paths don't just
add some local flavor.

180
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,900
Reversing out consonants doesn't just
impact ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

181
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,110
It leaves a legacy for later spinoffs.
The mentality,

182
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,680
these are either red as Loga graphs
or they stand for consonants.

183
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,030
Cuneiform leaves at different legacy,
completely unrelated languages.

184
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:05,080
We'll spend thousands of
years of borrowing and
reborrowing cuneiform to write

185
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,200
their own words,
but each time the symbols are red is low.

186
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,490
Good graphs or as syllables.
Flexibility is key here.

187
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,410
Look at this Egyptian hieroglyph.

188
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,740
It can be read as the logo graph for
mouth and AA or as the consonant or this

189
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,150
character.
It could be read as the logo graph,

190
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:26,980
meaning house or it could stand for the
consonant per the two consonants and the

191
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,680
Egyptian word.
Conveniently in Egyptian,

192
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,890
the little slashy below lets you
know when it's a pure logo graph.

193
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,910
The rebus discovery brings up the
tension between meaning and sound.

194
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,370
Is Riding phonetic or semantic?

195
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,390
Is it about encoding the meaning of
words or in coding? Speech sounds,

196
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,010
the old logo graphs. We're fundamentally
a meaning writing system. Sure.

197
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,140
This sounds like ray in Egyptian,

198
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,190
but what's crucial is that this is a
logo graph for the word meaning mouth.

199
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,220
Rebus writing takes a big
step towards sound writing.

200
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,060
This will come to stand for the
continent or regardless of meaning.

201
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,610
It may come as a surprise, but once
discovered, sound writing doesn't asked,

202
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,610
meaning writing, not at all. Indeed,

203
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,850
early writers notice that phonetic
writing brings up a problem,

204
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,480
a problem you probably missed because
of your comfort with sound writing.

205
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,650
A problem that meaning writing can
solve. Brace yourself. History,

206
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,710
because Loga graphs are
about to make a comeback

207
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,400
like all of the world's
earliest writing systems.

208
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,660
Chinese characters start out as symbols
that stand for words. A Rice Patty,

209
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,230
a person,
a tree.

210
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,360
These are logo graphs and they let you
depict specific language pieces to write

211
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,050
what you mean. But instead of requiring
different characters for every word,

212
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,130
the handy rebus principle lets you write
other things that sound like the lower

213
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:59,070
graph to write what you've say.
Sure.

214
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,310
You could use the reverse sounds like
principal to write any sound in your

215
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:06,360
language, but please consider this symbol
and answer the question that follows.

216
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,860
Does it mean son soon son or sewn?

217
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,940
Oh my. Did rebus writing get
you into a bit of trouble here.

218
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,280
When we see this character,

219
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,600
we could read it as a plain old logo
graph according to its meaning or any of

220
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:25,880
these rebus ways following
gets pronunciation. Which
one should you choose?

221
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,360
Think a bit outside of the jade box here
and take the lead of this. Han Scribe.

222
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,110
His solution is elegant.
Don't choose one.

223
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,060
Use both systems together.
What's that behind his back?

224
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,980
Is that a ho?
Yeah.

225
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,990
Major moments in the history of writing.

226
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,360
So here's the logo graph for horse,

227
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,570
but it also sounds the same
as the word for aunt said.

228
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:54,590
The rebus lets us write them both
with the same Glymph confusing,

229
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,640
not if you add the logo graph for insect
next to the sound to like character.

230
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,760
This says it's pronounced like horse,
which it is,

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,370
but that it's meaning has
something to do with insect.

232
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,470
You don't read the extra character.

233
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,710
It's a meaning hint determining
how to read the sound character,

234
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,180
so it's called the determinant.

235
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,063
Yeah.

236
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,840
One more mandarin example.
This logo graph means moon,

237
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,290
which happens to be
pronounced UAE using rebus.

238
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,760
Writing Yay also means amputate your feet.
Incidentally,

239
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:28,260
the word key is pronounced the same
way. Same problem, but nothing.

240
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,300
A couple determinative can't fix.

241
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,060
Add the determinative for
metal to this character.

242
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,710
Add knife to that one and let's leave
the moon B because that's already what it

243
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:39,660
means here.
Again,

244
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,780
the sounds like reading of a character
gives you it's phonetic component.

245
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,070
This extra logo graph clues you into
its meaning. It's semantic component.

246
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,780
Together they form a unit,

247
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,470
a whole character with a clear
meaning and a clear pronunciation.

248
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,210
Determinitive are very common in Chinese
characters, natively called Han Carrie.

249
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,120
In fact, since they hint at the
characters route, meaning it's radix.

250
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,100
Han determinitive get called radicals,
bringing back the characters sun.

251
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,540
It can be pronounced many ways true,
but at a determinative,

252
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,470
a silent helper character and
you can quickly narrow down,

253
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:18,160
it's meaning these extra determinitive
avoid ambiguous readings.

254
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,730
Which one is the sun in the sky,
which is a father's son,

255
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,550
which one means soon too easy.

256
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,820
There's something else to
learn from this quiet scribe.

257
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,520
He's using radicals to
clean up some ambiguity,

258
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,040
but even he knows that context matters.

259
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,310
He won't spell everything
out for you every time.

260
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,110
Sometimes this character means
for as in this is for you.

261
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,360
Other Times it's the verb supply.

262
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,620
He's balancing this tension in the history
of writing between what's easy on the

263
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:48,310
reader,

264
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,790
who needs more information to interpret
the words versus what's easy on the

265
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,000
writer, who typically knows what
he means when he's writing it.

266
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,160
Plus hand cramps.

267
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,600
The choice of leaving in or leaving out
helpful information isn't simply about

268
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,830
clarity and laziness.

269
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,020
It's a static throughout the history of
Chinese calligraphy from Oracle loans to

270
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,220
the rough cursive script.

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,210
Stylistic choices are made not
just semantic and phonetic choices.

272
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,770
Seeing through the calligraphers eyes you
can find in the history of writing not

273
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,320
only a vision of what
words and sounds look like,

274
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,410
but where words and sounds
go and where they stop.

275
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,300
When it comes to aesthetic
choices and Han characters,

276
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,080
none is more fundamental than the decision
to arrange character components in

277
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,670
blocks.
Bonus note,

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,870
this is definitely not the only time in
history that writing gets organized in

279
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:38,704
blocks.

280
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,570
So this radical sits on top
of this phonetic component
in a block making up one

281
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:48,310
whole character. The character for
flour, the idiographic man plus tree,

282
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,310
a man leaning a tree has two components
sitting side by side in a block and

283
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:56,850
they're the character for rest.
And here's one tree and its own block,

284
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,950
two trees meaning woods and three
trees for forest. Aesthetics aside,

285
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,490
what would happen if we took this sounds
like principal a step further and made

286
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:09,480
writing about the sounds is isn't
that a better solution to our scene,

287
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:14,280
son sown son problem. And one that doesn't
make us memorize tons of characters.

288
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,183
Yeah.

289
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,090
Okay.

290
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,820
Am I a stone worker? Etches elaborate
rows of characters onto a stele.

291
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,220
A tall stone brought in from far away.

292
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,950
That's now standing straight
up in the middle of the city.

293
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,970
The characters he's carving. Look more
like detailed pictures than writing,

294
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,620
but don't let that fool eel take a
look at this block. It means mountain,

295
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,380
but it's not.
Although the graph standing for mountain,

296
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,290
it's not a rebus symbol for think of a
word that rhymes with sheep mountains.

297
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,660
It's actually a block of two sound
symbols that spell the word [inaudible].

298
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,020
The Mayan word for mountain.
That's great for climbers,

299
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:58,950
but chocolate lovers may instead prefer
to sampled these three symbols that

300
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:03,300
together. Spell the word cat. Cow
Cocoa. There's a nifty shortcut here.

301
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,400
This bit doesn't even mean car.

302
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,420
It's actually a syllable
multiplier or iteration mark,

303
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:10,800
if you want the fancy name.

304
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,603
Sure.

305
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,790
I think you're being watched
over there in the jungle.

306
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,643
Maybe not.

307
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,693
Hmm.

308
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,760
Major moments in the history of
writing both of these Maya glyphs,

309
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,730
combined syllable characters
into blocks to write words.

310
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,370
This is full fledged sound writing.

311
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,840
These are Loga graphs that happened
to be read as sounds. They are sounds,

312
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,060
sounds capable of writing any syllable
and the language in a full syllabary like

313
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:45,320
the classical Maya script.

314
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,860
There are separate characters for just
about every possible syllable in the

315
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:49,694
language.

316
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,320
No longer must do invent
new word characters you can
make do with a much smaller

317
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:57,380
set of syllable characters.
Nice,

318
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,070
but syllable writing comes
with its own set of problems.

319
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:05,240
Here's a cliff that's quite
useful around these parts. Jaguar,

320
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,430
the where does actually belong,

321
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,710
but have you noticed something about the
Mayan syllabary consonant plus bowel,

322
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,340
continent plus bowel,
more consonants plus more vowels.

323
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,980
All of these syllables,
Indian vowels.

324
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,450
How in the world are you supposed
to write the lump in Balaam,

325
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,490
shifty scripty syllabi.

326
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,170
Dairies have grappled with this problem
and settled on two solutions. One,

327
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,470
leave out the final letter.
Just ignore it.

328
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,970
The term for this is under spelling
because you're not fully spelling the word

329
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,230
and it's a good solution because you
know ignoring your problems makes them go

330
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:47,000
away. Option to spell the last
letter with an extra syllable.

331
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,950
They use a syllable that just repeats the
last bowel so that we know we can just

332
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:54,250
ignore the final vowel.
This gets called the echo vowel.

333
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,250
Mayan likes number two a lot.

334
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,330
So the cow is Kakoa.
Well,

335
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,520
because times to Wa wheats,
the mountain is actually,

336
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,140
we'd see. And your new pet
Balaam is spelled Bala Ma.

337
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,160
Cross out the echo vowels and the
words practically read themselves.

338
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,850
Your new friend pulls you along
to show you another project.

339
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:23,650
He's working on an Amati Codex.
That's a paper book. Yes,

340
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:28,000
he has paper and yes books,
but that's not what's got him excited.

341
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,130
He folds open the book he's working
on maybe to share new ideas. No,

342
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,030
to brag about how inventive
and potentially efficient
his writing system is.

343
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,550
Know for his people.

344
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,580
The invention of the new
wasn't about ditching the old.

345
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,030
He shows you how creative he's been
with the characters you learned.

346
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,390
He shows you a mountain and calls it
weeds and then a Jaguar and calls it Bilam

347
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,840
Loga graphs. Wait a second,
you stop and ask him,

348
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,860
which is the correct way to write belong.
He writes Balama.

349
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,510
You ask him to write it again,
and he writes the logo graph,

350
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,060
but with the syllable and again,

351
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,000
but he writes the logo
graph plus two syllables.

352
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,930
He smiles mischievously.
They're all below them.

353
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,770
This is what he's proud of.
He can write the same word,

354
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,150
even the same syllable in different
ways and combinations without repeating

355
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:26,890
himself creative, but his use of
logo graphs plus syllables or calls.

356
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,180
The tension between sound writing,
meaning writing meaningful, determinative,

357
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,090
helped us choose the right
pronunciation for our rebus character.

358
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,590
And My loga graphs can still do that,
but the helping hand goes both ways.

359
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,100
The syllabary can also clarify the
sounds you should make when you've read a

360
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:44,800
lower graph.
Here's the character Jaguar,

361
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,520
but at a couple extra syllable hints and
you make it clear that we're meant to

362
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:52,960
read this glyphs as Bala Ma
minus the echo vowel. So Balaam,

363
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,170
these are phonetic compliments,
pronunciation clues,

364
00:22:56,171 --> 00:23:00,460
sitting comfortably alongside logo graphs.
If that's all too complex.

365
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,370
Just remember that you can
write everything in syllables,

366
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,110
but before you have time to settle
into this land of Balaam and Cacau to

367
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:12,670
practice those syllables, a sandy
wind starts blowing in from the east.

368
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,740
Uh, familiar reminder from a far away
land where even more dramatic changes are

369
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,840
about to shape the future of writing.

370
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,170
Even in these ancient times,

371
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,850
Egyptian monuments have been sitting
and weathering for thousands of years on

372
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:41,840
their great murals and pillars. You
find rows of little pictures, sorry,

373
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:45,500
not pictures.
Hieroglyphs sacred symbols,

374
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,510
but despite appearances, this isn't some
mysterious, very iconic picture writing.

375
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,760
It's consonant one continent signs,
two consonant signs,

376
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,150
three continent signs.
Oh, wall of consonants,

377
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,970
plus a sprinkle of logo
grass for determinitive.

378
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,750
It's not that Egyptian was a harsh
bowel lesson, desert of a tongue.

379
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,530
It's simply did not write it. The
bowels. Imagine if you wrote this way,

380
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,330
would that work?

381
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,840
And then imagine if you could add in Loga
graphs to make sure you've really got

382
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:15,830
your point across.

383
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Imagine you wrote like that and you're
thinking with hieroglyphs too difficult,

384
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,240
fine off to the caves with you where
you toil away with ancient miners on the

385
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,260
Sinai peninsula,

386
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,460
you and your fellow miners would find it
handy to leave messages for one another,

387
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,600
but there's no time for deep studies
of rows. A fancy hieroglyphs in here.

388
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,190
You need to keep it simple.

389
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:44,780
If you want another major moments
in the history of writing,

390
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,060
your characters look like scratchy,

391
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,880
rushed version of those
glamorous Egyptian symbols,

392
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,830
but they're meeting
doesn't matter anymore.

393
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,370
Nothing but consonants and the same
symbol for the same continent every time.

394
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,340
Take this character in Egyptian,
it means house.

395
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,530
The Semitic miners are calling a house.

396
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,570
A bet across any or top sounds suggest
that you can just take the first letter

397
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,890
of a word like the Egyptians had already
been doing with much of their continent

398
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,170
writing. You end up with a
letter for your sound bar.

399
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,300
Do the same thing with water, which
the Semitic speakers or calling them,

400
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,340
and you now have an mm sound with a
couple dozen elegant simplifications.

401
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,070
You create a simple,
reliable list of consonants.

402
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,990
An alphabet and you've given generations
of future children the joys of reciting

403
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,230
their abcs.

404
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Actually at this point in history there
Abg D's sometimes called an object or ob

405
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,370
God because who needs that wishy washy?

406
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:48,371
See when you can just use an at k after
a long hard day of mining an etching,

407
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,820
you turn to find that someone's
been watching you this whole time.

408
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,590
She's a trader, a Phoenician merchant
who knows a good thing when she sees it.

409
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,910
She's already made major cash and the
paper business where they turn tufty

410
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:06,410
stocky, swampy Egyptian per pirates
into flat ink. Couple sheets of paper.

411
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,670
She rushes back home to
Phoenicia and smirks.

412
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,860
Think of the advantage she has keeping
track of whatever anyone else tells her

413
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,910
just by remembering about as many
characters as she has, fingers and toes.

414
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,440
All the kings can keep their up two's,
hieroglyphs and their stone monuments.

415
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,240
The future of the Mediterranean will
belong to alphabets and paper writing is

416
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,140
going portable.

417
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,860
She uses this newfound alphabetic
leverage to turn a huge profit across the

418
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:45,480
entire eastern Mediterranean,

419
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,920
leaving people inspired to adopt and
adapt her alphabet wherever she goes.

420
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,070
All of this

421
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,610
and she doesn't even write you a
thank you card. How hard could it be?

422
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,530
Writing is easier than ever.

423
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,330
It feels universal like writings
here to stay for everyone,

424
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,230
but there's a peculiar quirk that's
easier to spot. In hindsight,

425
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,610
you and your mining crew,
we're communicating in a
Semitic language, Venetians,

426
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:10,720
a Semitic language.

427
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,740
All of these friendly shades of the
Phoenician alphabet were being used for

428
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:19,190
languages that sounded similar and
worked much the same way. Even Egyptian,

429
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,570
no, no Semitic language itself is at
least a distant relative of the Semitic

430
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:27,140
languages with a similar personality.
This continent,

431
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:31,730
alphabet is being tested in easy waters,
but history is shaking things up.

432
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,130
Who are merchant friend
comes back for your help.

433
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,270
She needs you to deliver your alphabet
to a very different people living along

434
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:39,104
her trade route.

435
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,260
What will happen when the alphabet
gets leaked outside of the family?

436
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,680
Grace, no, not that Greece. Greece.
Before there was a Parthenon,

437
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,290
a stern old man in a trademark.

438
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,430
Sporty Toga seems a bit on edge as he
glares at the pirates sheet clutched in

439
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:07,350
his hand. Can you see? You
try to shrug off his outburst,

440
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,980
but he can't let this
go. My friend, my friend,

441
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,090
he recounts how 500 years
before he was even born,

442
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,130
when the walls of Troy still stood, the
Greeks had a writing system of their own.

443
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,300
It was one of those more elaborate
syllabary plus logo graph types.

444
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,250
But that script had come and it had gone.
The new Greeks were people on the rise,

445
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,690
but I know literate people on the rise
that people looking for something new,

446
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,700
something great. And this
alphabet thing seems great almost.

447
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,590
He calls over his close friends.
The Phoenician consonants are useful.

448
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,370
He can seeds. But why these
extra characters for huffing,

449
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:50,160
coughing and clearing your throat.

450
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,690
These are a barbarian sounds.
Greeks have no need for them.

451
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,130
And what about the voicing
noises like and Ooh,

452
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,690
how to write them? Huh? So
much extra yet so much missing.

453
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,800
What a mess you've tried to explain,
but they laugh it off

454
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,620
here. I fixed for you. He says, see,

455
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,040
he was going to ditch
the barbarian letters,

456
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,650
but he had second thoughts
and it struck him.

457
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,600
Why not use these on Greek sounds
for vowels. The one you call a left,

458
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,820
ignore the throaty catch at the
beginning. It's, ah, take that, hey,

459
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,570
but ditch the huh and we're
left with a valley. A,

460
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,590
you send up that tight Wa
and wow and it's developed.

461
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,100
This isn't just a small correction.

462
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,460
This is a powerful major moments
in the history of writing.

463
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,820
He's fundamentally shifted the
way the alphabet functions.

464
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,840
It used to be just the consonant
suggesting the pronunciation of a word.

465
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,360
Once you recognize the word,
the job's done.

466
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,080
But Greek spelling isn't merely
about writing recognizable words.

467
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,460
It's about matching letters to sounds.
A new principal has just emerged,

468
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,510
perhaps even a new goal.
One sound, one character.

469
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,340
You suspect that he's not even aware of
the impact of his discovery as he tells

470
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:17,290
you to drop everything and come enjoy
some dinner and dancing. Hippy, silly.

471
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,910
The party goes on and on so long that
your new friends don't even see what's

472
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:25,840
happening beyond the walls of their city
state. This consonant vowel alphabet,

473
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,730
this pronunciation writing.

474
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:32,290
It's spreading inspiring new alphabets
to the east with flavors like Armenian in

475
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:35,890
cyrillic popping up out west in Italy,
the Tuscans,

476
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,490
the Etruscans borrow it and
they pass it on to the Romans.

477
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,600
The Romans burst down and splatter it
among the Celts cinder manic peoples,

478
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,130
and eventually the world.

479
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,810
Such a visual rainbow of variations and
yet they'll all stick with the basic

480
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:54,610
principle of writing a character for
each sound, consonants and vowels.

481
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,500
Finally, you see your writing
system in this story, your alphabet,

482
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,730
all because a handful of submit
symbols got mistaken for Greek vowels,

483
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,250
but before you get over confident,

484
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,980
know that the history of
writing doesn't stop here.

485
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,060
This isn't the be all and end all,
not even close.

486
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,390
You're back in old Phoenicia where it
turns out the Greeks aren't the only ones

487
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:24,470
looking to buy a vowel.

488
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,430
Your contact in town is
still your merchant friend
of me who reminds you of how

489
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:31,310
she traded your continent,
alphabet across the ancient world.

490
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,600
That object spread to every language
with even a passing resemblance to

491
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,580
finishing. Every town from
here to Carthage has some
version of her object spot.

492
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:45,250
The Egyptians, those stuck in their way.
Traditionalist initially, these submit it,

493
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,300
speakers loved it,
they were proud of it,

494
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,110
but the days are turning to
years and that love grows cold.

495
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,050
They grumble that they're
stuck with these continents.

496
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,870
Just consonants clamoring for vowels.

497
00:31:56,871 --> 00:32:00,350
They get desperate and grab a few
characters to stand in for a long sound.

498
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,000
Take a look. This symbol is
originally the stop between, ah, ah,

499
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,290
this one's a y. Uh, yes
sound, and this is a word,

500
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,990
but they're about to
become not these things.

501
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,800
Thanks to major moments
in the history of writing.

502
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,090
This moment hits you twice because it
brings up both an innovation specific to

503
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:24,050
submitting scripts and a more general
principle that kind of bins the rules of

504
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:25,700
the alphabet game first,

505
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:29,780
it's worth reiterating that object writing
systems are viable ways to write and

506
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,830
read a language they work,
but with one obvious shortcoming,

507
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,010
those missing vowels can
create ambiguous situations.

508
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,100
But what if instead of every vowel,

509
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,480
we just had a few helpful hints that
suggested the presence of certain kinds of

510
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:48,410
vowels. Take this letter. What
actually they called it. Wow.

511
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,120
Wow. Now imagine that we keep using
it and words that have the sound what?

512
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,600
But we also extend its use placing it
between continents for the similar enough

513
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:01,370
foul sound. Ooh. In the old op
job you'd have to write soon.

514
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,140
And son with the same characters.

515
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,950
S plus in everything else is
vowels and we don't have those.

516
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,200
But suddenly our extended work comes in
handy. Son Doesn't have that OOO sound.

517
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,770
So it's still s plus in,
but soon does.

518
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,650
So we add in the WWE do
the same thing with Ja,

519
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,340
which can double as a long I and
this quirky catch in your throat.

520
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:26,390
Pause between uh oh a left,
which can double as a long. Ah,

521
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,980
and you end up with three handy of
suggestors, the mattress Lectio,

522
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,850
these helpful mothers of reading
that show up in Aramaic, Hebrew,

523
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,590
Arabic and Syriac. But these mothers
don't leave their continent net's behind.

524
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,280
They still double as consonants. The
object traded the ambiguity of a vowel.

525
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:48,320
This existence for new kind of ambiguity.
Depending on context.

526
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,030
Each of these mattress may be a continent
or it might be a vowel one character,

527
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,450
multiple sounds.
This is a huge trend in alphabet.

528
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,780
Why invent new characters
when you can reuse an old one?

529
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,580
Repurposing continents for vowels
here and there won't satisfy everyone.

530
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,420
These bickering scribes aren't
content with mattress lectio Giannis.

531
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,510
They're not just trying to
tell son apart from soon.

532
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,990
The bickering scribes are bickering over
how to read one of their most treasured

533
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:17,960
sayings.
One says that it's such a fine point.

534
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,590
You wouldn't understand unless you were
incredibly well versed in his language,

535
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,810
but he makes an analogy for you.

536
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,090
Write the word news in a continent
only alphabet. It's in ws. Fine.

537
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,230
Now imagine that someone comes along
with their fancy consonant vowel hybrids

538
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,730
and spells the word nous in w s hmm.

539
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:43,160
Wait a second. He shows you a cheat sheet
he's been keeping. It's so easy. He says,

540
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:46,400
pointing out the little dots and dashes
above and below letters to keep his

541
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:49,970
vowel straight.
Put them here for an awe there for an a.

542
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,670
You can even add them below
one of the long vowel things.

543
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:57,350
If you need to distinguish, say an
eat, nobody's confused. That's it.

544
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,690
He won't tolerate the
vagueness any longer.

545
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,860
Effective immediately in all important
text where clear reading matters.

546
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,420
Everyone's to use this method.
And so for generations,

547
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:09,920
scribes would mark bowels
above and below the consonants,

548
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,130
writing bowels in what was once
a consonant, only alphabet,

549
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,180
but as much as the pious and
students whereby they're Dadi vowels.

550
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,110
Modern Arabic and Hebrew speakers stick
with the simple consonants plus the

551
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,760
extended consonant vowel mothers.

552
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,180
The optional helper dots get thrown in
like a life preserver for struggling

553
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:29,840
learners or careful text,
but grownups don't need them anymore.

554
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,990
The spice market in India,
the hooded figure in front of you,

555
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,170
apologizes for the kidnapping.
He needs her help.

556
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,010
He explains that his land has taken
part in history's most elaborate and

557
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:54,780
rigorous memorization exercises instead
of scribes. They had recitations.

558
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,450
These weren't retellings
of campfire stories.

559
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,110
These were whole libraries of
knowledge handed down for generations.

560
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,240
He says his name is [inaudible].

561
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,040
This is his land and he is king
after a bloody and violent war.

562
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,170
He had a change of heart and now has,

563
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:13,470
but one singular focus
to spread his message.

564
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,710
A lot of tolerance and
compassion throughout the land.

565
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,760
But he doesn't want to use the mouth
to ear memorization ways of the oral

566
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,960
tradition. That's for old
texts and old ideas. No,

567
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:28,260
his vision is to install massive
pillars around his empire.

568
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,810
Each one engraved with his list of edicts.

569
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,630
This he explains is where you come in.

570
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,800
See He's been keeping tabs on you as
you roamed the land of the submitted odd

571
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:42,240
jobs and he really likes this crazy
consonant alphabet idea. He'll take it,

572
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,860
but he also appreciates the whimsical
simplicity of accent continents with vowel

573
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:50,960
marks. Oh, and he doesn't want to have to
write the vowel if it's just a short, uh,

574
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,680
his language is full of those.

575
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,330
So he'll write funnel something like
this with these built in syllables,

576
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,370
but wait, it's not funnel that
final or is in a separate syllable.

577
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,480
He needs a way to write,
just bear consonants to tell his past,

578
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:07,770
apart from his pasta.

579
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,580
How with a simple hush
stroke below the letter.

580
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,940
Now he brags to you.
His system is complete.

581
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,510
Make sure you don't miss
the stuff he's taking here.

582
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,500
It's a major moments in
the history of writing.

583
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,220
Each of the character units
fundamentally represents a syllable.

584
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,530
It just so happens that unless the
vowel and not syllable is a short aw,

585
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,850
the val gets added on,

586
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:36,030
onto or below or beside the
consonant character on their own.

587
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,500
The base characters contain
that dummy vowel, uh, like Po.

588
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,050
But you can take that and modify
it with any vowel you like.

589
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,300
Certain bowels go in certain places
like e to the side or Ooh below.

590
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,710
So in India, characters or syllables,
but unlike a full Cilla Barry,

591
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:56,760
you don't need a completely separate
character for each separate syllable.

592
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,640
And all characters give
consonant plus vowel information.

593
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,450
But unlike a full alphabet,
you don't line up sequences of consonants,

594
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,550
plus vowels, consonants, plus vowels.

595
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,250
The hybrid combination nature
of the system earns it.

596
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:12,690
The name Alpha syllabary combos
are built into this system.

597
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:17,691
Paving the way for over a
thousand ligatures commonly
linked characters in the

598
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,960
Alpha Ciliary.
Sure.

599
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,690
Other writing systems developed
ligatures and their calligraphy,

600
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:27,020
but the indic Alpha salivary welcomes
them naturally as it's past all around

601
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:31,500
this entire slice of the world up to
Nepal and Tibet down the coast to Burma,

602
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,540
Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and beyond.

603
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,810
The script keeps updating its but
continues to capture consonants and vowels

604
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,750
accurately like an alphabet
and to write those vowels,

605
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,150
consonants in syllable
units like the syllabary,

606
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,590
even completely unrelated Alpha Cilla.
Barry's seize on this same idea.

607
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,990
This is the Ethiopic symbol for ma.

608
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,320
This one reads May and this is Moo.

609
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,010
This is law Ley and loop. Now that you
understand that was still a berries.

610
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,380
You must answer this next question
if this symbol sounds like blah.

611
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,380
How do you write bay and Bu in Ethiopia?

612
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,050
This is your Gig is ABCDs.

613
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,980
The Abu Gita looks different
but works much the same way.

614
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,450
Your characters have never looked so
different even after the Greeks and Romans

615
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:17,284
took them over.

616
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,820
Maybe it's this dizzying variety of
writing systems or maybe thoughts.

617
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:23,500
Pill is starting to wear off.

618
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,790
Another time, another king.
This time in a Korean palace,

619
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,350
he presents himself as king. Say, John,
as you get a grip on your surroundings,

620
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:41,970
you began to tell him of your journeys.

621
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,660
Yet with the sweeping gay is
the king books right past you.

622
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:50,040
You've been out for a very long time.
Over a thousand years,

623
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,970
the world has come so far and the
scripts you once knew have to,

624
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,200
he reminds you of the old Chinese local
graphs and sound demeaning combinations.

625
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,610
Those are still useful to his
court to appoint. You See,

626
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,670
Chinese has these nice word units,
one after another,

627
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,620
but Korean he boasts has these elegantly
complex words with different pieces and

628
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:14,940
endings. Fitting Chinese writing
to Korean grammar hasn't been easy.

629
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,890
He tells you other people across the seed
who've gone through a similar struggle.

630
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,640
The Japanese simplified Chinese
characters by turning them into a fixed

631
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:27,180
syllabary, which they now use
alongside the Chinese characters.

632
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,350
So they have these syllable characters
and these thousands of Han characters.

633
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,380
They used the Han characters for
the meaning heavy components.

634
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,730
They'll tabulary terms.

635
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,780
Then they use the syllabary
to write little grammatical
words and word pieces or

636
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:43,560
new vocabulary words that don't
historically have their own Chinese logo.

637
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:47,010
Breath such a complicated system.
Gentlemen.

638
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,660
The king has an almost puzzle book
like he's holding back a punchline.

639
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,520
He recounts how an Old Japan women wrote
entire books using only the syllable

640
00:40:56,521 --> 00:41:00,000
characters because riding with the
traditional Han characters was seen as the

641
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,420
masculine thing to do,
but he knows of another land.

642
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,650
He's heard exotic tales of the West where
people write out all of their sounds.

643
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,850
Logically, he pauses. He can't
quite grasp this himself.

644
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,900
You snicker as you think back on how you
saw the alphabet develop with your own

645
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:18,120
eyes and your journeys,
you would know.

646
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,320
So you sit down and show him how to
write every vowel and consonant with the

647
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:25,800
alphabet, a couple dozen shapes,
and you can write any sound.

648
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,140
You smile and think so simple, but
he lets out an unimpressed. Sy.

649
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,510
Why do all the characters so different,
so haphazard?

650
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,130
I mean you make fun and VA by putting
your bottom lip against your top teeth.

651
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,480
The only difference is that your throat
vibrates. When you say VA, he quizzes you.

652
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,730
Why do you write fuck and fuck? And he
goes on interrogating you. What about,

653
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,110
but why does it look that way when it's
just taking the VUS sound and saying it

654
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,380
through smacked lips seems
you underestimated the king.

655
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,300
He doesn't want any old alphabet.

656
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,540
He wants a writing system that shows
the various features of sounds that the

657
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:07,640
sound is made in your throat against your
teeth, made with your lips and so on.

658
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,980
He puts his brightest scholars to work,

659
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,990
giving them the humble name
of the hall of worthies, Ingo,

660
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,030
the experts and outcomes and other
major moments in the history of writing.

661
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,790
They develop Korean Hungle,
featural alphabet.

662
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,470
Every syllable gets separated out into
its own block. The syllables, consonants,

663
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:30,020
and vowels will be written
side by side within that block,

664
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,890
each consonant and vowel letter inside
that block will be shaped according to

665
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:37,610
its features. So here are the continents
that get pronounced with the lips.

666
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,330
See the similar lip shape.
Here's God,

667
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,140
and here's cut again,
similar sounds similar shape.

668
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,530
The featural alphabet was so
simple and straightforward forward.

669
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,910
One of the king's historians almost dared
people to learn it. If you're smart,

670
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,500
you can learn it in one morning. If
you're a fool, it'll take you 10 days.

671
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,110
Not everyone's jumping on the Hungle.
Easy train community accessible writing,

672
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,950
father's traditionalist who skip out on
the innovation and keep using Chinese

673
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:07,650
characters,

674
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,650
fit it to Korean Honjo or hand characters
even into the 19 hundreds still for

675
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,060
the rest. Writing is easier than
ever. It has its first drug star.

676
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,620
It even gets its own holiday.
Oh, writing. You've come a long,

677
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,960
long way from pictographs.
St a case.

678
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,750
The day that thougth invented writing,

679
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,500
fabulous warned him that he discovered
a drug that would make people lose touch

680
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:14,340
with themselves. If you're still
watching, you took thoughts, pill,

681
00:44:14,341 --> 00:44:16,440
and software yourself.
The effects it really had.

682
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,440
It started with visual
depictions of the world.

683
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,470
Pictographs signs for ideas and thoughts,

684
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,090
idiot graphs than a transformation from
picture writing to true writing with

685
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,620
symbols that stand for words.

686
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:33,120
Moga graphs using those words to
sand for similar sounding words.

687
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,520
Rebus. Then those sound alikes
became syllable characters. Silod,

688
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:42,480
Barry's continent characters, odd jobs
and then consonant and vowel characters,

689
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,740
alphabets or even consonant and vowel
syllables, Alpha silver berries,

690
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,830
and if things get really
linguistic Salvey Alpha,

691
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:54,510
that's become all featural characters
grouped by their phonetic properties along

692
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:57,180
the way, writing had to deal
with the tensions and take sides.

693
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,610
Should it represent meanings or sounds?

694
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,020
Should it benefit the reader or the
writer contained maximum information about

695
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:07,500
every sound or just enough to
recognize the shape of a word?

696
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,040
Should it be flexible and
creative or rigid and consistent?

697
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,270
How do physical techniques shape it?
Oh Hen who did it first,

698
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,800
who did it best?

699
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,250
Maybe you've learned to make some
sense out of the chaotic noise of world

700
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,084
writing systems.

701
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,770
Maybe you can appreciate it.

702
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,540
Some of the problems,
each one solves the traditions.

703
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:30,520
It captures the ambiguity's it creates
or perhaps it's more comfortable just to

704
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:32,740
close your eyes and wake up back at home.

705
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,460
Looking at your familiar characters of
your familiar writing system plastered

706
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:37,280
across your favorite.
Yeah,

707
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,990
websites still somehow you can't
even look at that the same way.

708
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,860
It's just one invention among many
in the long history of this language

709
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,900
technology we call fighting.

710
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,130
Okay.
