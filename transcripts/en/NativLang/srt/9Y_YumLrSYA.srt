1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,350
Okay.
Mm.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,700
You've got a feel for
variables versus constants,

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,240
predicates versus subjects,
the quantifiers, no.

4
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:16,650
Summit all and taking
advantage of variable.

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:21,250
Send more scope to translate everyday
phrases into logic. If that's not true,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,130
please go back and watch the
last three videos in this series.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,700
It's time to move on to
a logical operators or
connectives logical connectives.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,580
Let's build our sentences out a bit more.
To do that,

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,820
let's start with the logical connectives
add add or we can join two symbols with

10
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:40,384
Ad.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,010
The conjunction can come between two
statements like she saw Bob and the house

12
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,160
is red or this is a
fish and fish can swim.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,450
The conjunction might come between
two variables like x and y,

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,660
but and has less obvious applications.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,300
If we want to say that
Bob is a good person,

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,370
we can break that sentence into
Bobby's human and Bob is good.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,020
We can render some good person.
As for some x,

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,050
x is human and x is good
like many operators and may
be represented by different

19
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:18,520
symbols and different texts. For now,
stick with one and learn others as needed.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,050
Also, let me mention that the meaning
of this logical and has pretty strong,

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,180
it asserts both things being joined,

22
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:29,650
so it's vanilla and chocolate means
that it's both vanilla and chocolate.

23
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:33,640
It's not the week and have you can choose
between vanilla and chocolate where

24
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:38,641
you actually mean or speaking of or
we can join sentences with or as well.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,530
This disjunction might come
between two statements like p or Q,

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,710
like this is vanilla or this is chocolate,

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
but we can also use it
with variables x or y.

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,520
So everything is vanilla or chocolate
means that all x's are vanilla chocolate

29
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:00,310
or both? Both, yes, this
or is called inclusive.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,420
So when you're joining two things with
the logical or realize that you're saying

31
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:07,300
the first thing,
the second thing or both of them,

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,180
if you want to rule out
the option of both of them,

33
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,800
you have to use what's called an exclusive
or it's vanilla or it's chocolate,

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,050
but it's not chocolate plus vanilla.

35
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,120
These ants and ores bringing up a topic I,

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,740
I brought up before the
scope of a quantifier.

37
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,070
Look at what happens when two
predicates are in a quantify or scope.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,910
It applies to both of them.
For all x,

39
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,320
x is human and x can swim
just means everybody can swim.

40
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,490
For some x,
x is dirty or x is cluttered.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
Something is dirty or cluttered.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,140
Where you're saying that
this thing may be dirty,

43
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,670
cluttered or both dirty and
cluttered. Last, for some x,

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,230
x is not dirty or x is not
cluttered with an exclusive or

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,980
what happens when you negate to symbols
joined by an or or like not chocolate or

46
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,270
vanilla.
A set of rules known as Dimauro Gins.

47
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,130
Laws will help you deal with those cases.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,660
If you want to say not chocolate and
vanilla, you'll rep represent the phrases,

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,670
not chocolate or vanilla.
On the flip side, you,

50
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,020
when you want to say not
chocolate or vanilla,

51
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,310
this comes out as not vanilla
and chocolate in logic,

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,840
not chocolate or vanilla is treated the
same as not chocolate and not vanilla.

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Well not chocolate and vanilla is treated
like not chocolate or not vanilla.

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,170
Before moving onto the rest
of the connectives here,

55
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:40,171
a few phrases to translate use and or
or that's either and or or for each

56
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,754
statement

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,060
onto some new stuff. You're probably
already familiar with the equals symbol.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
As you'd expect.

59
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,150
This indicates a logical equivalents
like some x is equal to some why.

60
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,580
Nothing new here,
so let's move on.

61
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,410
Consider sentences where you
say that if one thing is true,

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,260
then something else follows this.

63
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,140
If then construction is
very important in logic.

64
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,830
We'll use it to structure even very
basic statements where it's hidden in

65
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:25,450
ordinary language. Let's take the
statement. English is a language. No.

66
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,320
If then there,

67
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,900
the logic for this simple sentence is
actually for all x. If x is English,

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,460
then x is a language.

69
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,910
We can translate it this way where
the horse shoe symbol is the if then

70
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,170
conditional.
Take another sentence.

71
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,820
This time everybody swims in logic.
That's for all eggs.

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,920
If x is human,
the next swims,

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,480
there are other popular symbols for
this conditional like the left to right

74
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:55,360
Arrow,
like the versions of ads and knots.

75
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,630
There are different ways of writing
the same symbol. The logic is the same.

76
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,890
There's another type of conditional
called the bike conditional.

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,700
The meaning here is quite different.
It's if and only if,

78
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,060
let's take the sentence
only water is refreshing.

79
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,190
The sentence means for all x.
X is refreshing if and only if x is water

80
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,310
ratchet this up one level.
It's only edible if it's good food.

81
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,010
Here we mean for all x.
X is edible.

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,400
If and only if x is good and x is food,

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,910
notice that this if and
only if is really strong.

84
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,110
What's refreshing has to be water and
what's water has to be refreshing.

85
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,431
Likewise,

86
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,030
what's good food has to be edible and
what's edible has to be good food.

87
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,230
Next one, when you're drawing
a conclusion in language,

88
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,850
you often use the word therefore,

89
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,230
this therefore indicates that whatever
follows is implied by whatever came

90
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:54,580
before. You can show this in logic with
a triple dot before your conclusion.

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,270
Let's say you propose a simple line
reasoning like everybody knows something.

92
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,820
John Somebody so he knows something.

93
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,060
You're probably getting used to
translations into logic by now,

94
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,710
so I'll let you figure those phrases out.

95
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,200
The first one that's right for
all x for some y. If x is human,

96
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,620
the next knows why.
That's everybody knows something.

97
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,720
Your next line is simple.

98
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,350
John is human and the last therefore
for some why Joe and John knows why.

99
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,690
That's just about all the basic stuff
you need to begin uncovering the logic

100
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:30,890
behind everyday language.

101
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,180
Of course there are other logics that
expand the use of formal logic and give it

102
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,620
a variety of applications.

103
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,910
Let's take a look at one basic example
of such a logic called modal logic.

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,170
Modal logic allows you to incorporate
modals into the formal structure.

105
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,340
I briefly explored modal verbs in the
lessons on morphology or the grammar of

106
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,310
words and language.
Examples of modal verbs in English.

107
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:57,311
Our can May and must the basic modal
symbols in Mount Modal logic are it is

108
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,960
necessary and it is possible.

109
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,200
Okay.

110
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
For example,
think of a statement p,

111
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,390
take this as dogs read books.

112
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,920
If we say that it is necessary
that p this means it is necessary.

113
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,090
That dog's read books.

114
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,260
We can also say that dogs can read books.

115
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,390
It is not necessary that everyone
read books and dogs cannot read books.

116
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Notice that when we say something
like can or it is possible,

117
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,620
that leaves a lot of room to discuss
the probability of that possibility,

118
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,560
which is one of those topics
I'll tackle in the next video.

119
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,810
I know I've thrown a lot out at you,

120
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:41,530
but I'm fairly sure you are already
getting a feel for how this kind of logic

121
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:44,740
really gets down to the structure
of thoughts expressed in language.

122
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,080
So let's move on to do a few translations.

123
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,750
Pause the video whenever
you need some time to think.

124
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,773
No,

125
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,941
that was fun.

126
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:35,780
Wasn't it all wrapped up these lessons
next time with the discussion of how to

127
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,770
represent members of a set and express
the language of probability in logic

128
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,810
until next time,
keep practicing.

129
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah.
Yeah.
