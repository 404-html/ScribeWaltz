1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,870
Once upon a time people wrote this way.
You couldn't even buy a vowel.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,620
Someone had to invent them.
It might've had been something like this,

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,220
Greece, Greece, Greece.
Before there was a Parthenon,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,880
a stern old man in a trademark,
sporty Toga, seems a bit on edge.

5
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:28,050
As he glares at the pirates sheet
clutched in his hand. You see,

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,630
you try to shrug off his outburst,
but he can't let this go. My friend,

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,640
my friend, he recounts how 500
years before he was even born,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,650
when the walls of Troy still stood, the
Greeks had a writing system of their own.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,820
It was one of those more elaborate
syllabary plus Logograph types.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,800
But that script had come and it had gone.
The new Greeks were people on the rise,

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,240
but I know literate people on the rise
of people looking for something new,

12
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,250
something great, and this
alphabet thing seems great almost.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,140
He calls over his close friends.
The Phoenician consonants are useful,

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,920
he can seeds, but why these
extra characters for huffing,

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,680
coughing and clearing your throat.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,240
These are barbarian sounds.
Greeks have no need for them.

17
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,680
And what about the voicing
noises? Like Ah, Ooh,

18
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,240
how to write them. Huh? So
much extra yet so much missing.

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,350
What a mess you tried to explain,
but they laugh it off

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,200
here. I fixed for you. He says, see,

21
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,590
he was going to ditch
the barbarian letters,

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,200
but he had second thoughts
and it struck him.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,150
Why not use these on Greek sounds
for vowels. The one you call a left,

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,370
ignore the throaty catch at the
beginning. It's, ah, take that. Hey,

25
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,130
but ditch the huh.
And we're left with a vowel Lee.

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,110
A loosen up that tight wa
in. Wow. And it's the vow.

27
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,650
Ooh,
this isn't just a small correction.

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,000
This is a powerful major moments
in the history of writing.

29
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,360
He's fundamentally shifted the
way the alphabet functions.

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,380
It used to be just the continent
suggesting the pronunciation of a word.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,900
Once you recognize the word,
the job's done.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,590
But Greek spelling isn't merely
about writing recognizable words.

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,970
It's about matching letters to sounds.
A new principal has just emerged,

34
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,050
perhaps even a new goal.
One sound, one character.

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,880
You suspect that he's not even aware of
the impact of his discovery as he tells

36
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:40,830
you to drop everything and come enjoy
some dinner and dancing. Hippy silly.

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,450
The party goes on and on so long that
your new friends don't even see what's

38
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:49,380
happening beyond the walls of their city.
State, this continent, bowel, alphabet,

39
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,990
this pronunciation,
writing, it's spreading,

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,250
inspiring new alphabets to the east
with flavors like Armenian in Cyrillic,

41
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,450
popping up out west in Italy.
The skins,

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,040
the Etruscans borrow it and
they pass it on to the Romans.

43
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,600
The Romans burst down in,

44
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,490
splatter it among the Celts in Germanic
peoples and eventually the world such as

45
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,200
visual rainbow of variations,

46
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,490
and yet they'll all stick with the basic
principle of writing a character for

47
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:19,540
each sound, consonants
and vowels. Finally,

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,050
you see your writing system in this story,
your alphabet,

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,250
all because a handful of submit, simple.
It's got mistaken for Greek vowels,

50
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,770
but before you get over confident,

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,500
know that the history of
writing doesn't stop here.

52
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,610
This isn't the be all and end all,
not even close.
