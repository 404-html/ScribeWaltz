1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,610
China has a lung linguistic tradition.
Did you know Chinese scholars?

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:09,630
We're digging into old pronunciations
centuries before Europeans were

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,400
reconstructing prodo languages.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,830
This is the tale of how they uncovered
their ancient imperial language.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,030
Yeah,

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,580
I struggle with Chinese pronunciation.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,700
I have ever since the
dictionary and cassettes,

8
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:30,100
my granddad once gave me for my birthday,

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,810
but lately I've been burying myself in
hundreds of pages of Chinese linguistic

10
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:37,900
history, and you know
what? I'm in good company,

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,580
Chinese pronunciation puzzled
experts in China for a long,

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,250
long time.
Like this fellow,

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,930
a scholar reconstructing a language in
the 1840s you know this story by now,

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,310
I've told it before.
Compare a group of related languages.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,840
Classify them into a family tree,
then reconstruct their common ancestor.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,020
Oh,
but that's not the story this time.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,870
This scholar is Chumley.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,430
He's confronting a centuries old problem.
How do you recover?

19
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:14,380
This sounds immortalized in
classical texts. How do you
make the old poems, Ryan?

20
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,980
Again, here's the catch.
You have no recordings,

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,090
no phonetic transcriptions,
not even an alphabet.

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,610
You're working with characters.

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,480
The Han characters we've
talked about here before.

24
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,360
Each one's standing for a one
syllable word or word peace.

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,150
He scrutinizes the book in front
of him. It looks old, stodgy even,

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,610
but it has quite a backstory.

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,990
1,261 years earlier,
uh,

28
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:47,620
Mister Lou invited eight friends
over for a slumber party.

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,030
They started their evening with wine
and conversation, but late in the night,

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,620
the friendly chitchat turned into a
heated debate over the exact pronunciation

31
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,090
of old texts. The way people recite them
in the north is wrong. No, they're wrong.

32
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:03,340
In the south enough talk,

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,790
Mr Lou inked his brush and outlined
what would become the t a. N.

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,740
He eventually filled five scrolls with
over 11,000 characters divided among the

35
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:18,190
four Chinese tones and
subdivided into rhyming groups.

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,070
Then he broke down the
sound of each character.

37
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,940
How with two more characters and upper
character to match the initial consonant

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,060
and it'll lower character to rhyme with
the final sounds including the tone.

39
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,940
Take the character here,
meaning east.

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,020
It had the initial of duck
and the final of UHMM.

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,100
So using the reconstructed pronunciation,
we'll talk about it at the end.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,780
It's done with this method called funds.
Yeah,

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,570
you can capture the sound of a syllable,

44
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,240
simple and clever,

45
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,990
but it stopped short of giving an overview
of Chinese phonology for that Reimers

46
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:03,160
needed to take step.
Organize this info into tables.

47
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,710
The 12th century Rhyme Mirror is full
of rhyme tables. Here's one of them.

48
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,480
The very first table in the book,
the starting label gives the table number,

49
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,270
number one, and the kind of rhyme.
These syllables have a sort of uhm,

50
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,390
along the top row are six articulation
categories for consonants and down the

51
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,530
side,
the four tones,

52
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,160
the four rows per tone give
more info about the syllable,

53
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,850
but their interpretation is debated.
So try this,

54
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,870
find me a tongue sound.
A lingual that's clear,

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,820
meaning voiceless and has the first tone.
So for this syllable type,

56
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,680
we've pieced together something like doom.

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,140
And then there's a partly clear one,
meaning aspirated.

58
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,630
So kind of a tone.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,240
And this one is dirty or muddy,
which means a voiced sound.

60
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,630
So maybe don't,
okay.

61
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,210
What about all these circles though?

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,660
What do they mean syllable not found?

63
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,700
So when you look for a lip sound that's
clear for the first tone in this chart,

64
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,970
you find nothing like boom recorded here,

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,220
but there is a boom mug
wards just like that.

66
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,290
You're excavating old pronunciations,

67
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,530
Chinese rhyme style and so confidence
scholars spent centuries sounding out

68
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,410
ancient Chinese syllables and teaching.

69
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:36,460
The Chinese had exactly
36 initial consonants,

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,310
but Chung Lee's not convinced.

71
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,940
He's combing through old fund ca
meticulously chaining together initials of

72
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:49,981
initials and finals of finals
is linked sets revealed flaws.

73
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,290
There weren't 36 initials,

74
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,910
there were 41 five of them
needed to be split in two,

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
but there's more.

76
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,150
The sounds in the rhyme tables
are not the sounds in the tin.

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,560
These are two different stages.
Later research,

78
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,190
we'll go on to show that even the
earlier stage itself is complicated.

79
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,700
It's a compromise between
ancient literary dialects.

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Thinking back to those late night
debates over the north versus the south,

81
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,210
that sounds about right,

82
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,880
but all this hard work merely
left us with categories, boxes,

83
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,190
boxes for four tones, boxes
for initials, boxes for finals.

84
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,870
The enough with the guesswork.

85
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,430
What are the precise sounds that
really fit into these boxes.

86
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,250
In the early 19 hundreds of Swede traveled
to China and dug into the old rhymes

87
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,340
and tables,
but then added an important piece,

88
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,850
the many living varieties of
Chinese call green was fascinated.

89
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,340
He created surveys and set out to document
them and he used his results to fill

90
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:02,300
out the rhyme categories with real sounds.

91
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,050
How well take that fourth tone also
called the checked tone along the southern

92
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,730
coast. He's checked tones,
syllables have a final stop sound.

93
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,980
So this old character meaning
country is or in Mandarin,

94
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,320
but in Cantonese it's who's older?

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,460
Well,

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,290
look at the last three languages
in Kellgren's list of dialects,

97
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,610
Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese.

98
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,010
They use Sino, Zenith pronunciations,
meaning China, foreign.

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,060
Basically the way the characters
sounded to them when they were imported,

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,840
their words also have that k it points
back to an ancient pronunciation for that

101
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:54,200
character that ended in a consonant like

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,950
linguists went on to refine these
reconstructions and to paint acoustic

103
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:05,060
portraits of ancient Chinese
that put sound downright
foreign in Mandarin. Today.

104
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,450
They even revealed small
but important distinctions.

105
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:13,451
Calgrin missed like these pairs of
Tromeo and they taught me one last thing

106
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,830
while I was over here struggling to
understand Chinese pronunciation.

107
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,870
It's not a single language
called ancient Chinese. No,

108
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:27,590
it's a period in linguistic
history, cold, middle,

109
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,870
Chinese middle,

110
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,020
because there's an even
older language to uncover.

111
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,480
A thousand years older still.

112
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,550
Maybe one day we'll rhyme our
way into old Chinese until then.

113
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,040
Stick around and subscribe for language.
