1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,590
Alone. Mysterious texts teases your
curiosity. You're in a dark room.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,540
Let's say an amusing basement.
No, even better. Some were
more adventurous. A cave.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,990
Yeah.
Your excitement fades to baffled.

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:16,920
Wonder as your brain starts to hum
with the tedium of cracking this text,

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,730
a tedium that call's not for the brazen
and venturing of an Indiana Jones,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
but the careful testing of a
touring or sample, you don't.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,070
You don't know the language of this text.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,010
You don't even know what words it encodes.
You can't even start to pronounce it.

9
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:34,650
Symbols. You're not even sure this is
writing at this moment of confusion.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,190
If your ear is free, fellow language
traveler and budding decipher.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,920
Let me hold out my hand
and offer a morsel of hope.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,540
What if I told you that you can know what
these symbols are without ever needing

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,710
to know how to read them?

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,080
And what if I also told you all you
needed to do this was to know how to count

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,620
first pluck out the basic writing
types you met in thoughts pill. What?

16
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,330
You haven't seen that? No Way. Come on,

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,050
let's go watch it first and then come
back and pluck out the basic writing types

18
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:08,850
you met in thoughts, pill, consonant,
or vowel symbols, syllable symbols,

19
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,970
and words. Symbols. Now
let's start counting.

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,370
Take a string in English,

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,200
just a bit of written text and count the
number of distinct graphings you find

22
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,750
it. Okay, but longer is better here.

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,720
More chances for all the signs
and the writing system to show up,

24
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,560
including those less common ones.
You know your Qs, your ex's jerseys.

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,680
So let's count the signs in
all of Shakespeare's sonnets.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,620
I'm counting everything but x.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,340
So keep taking more and more bigger
and bigger samples in English.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,160
And you'll end up counting the
26 letters of our alphabet.

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,350
Do the same for Russian.
And I hear you.

30
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:48,351
Account 33 try it with Hawaiian and you
only find 13 now reach for Japanese text

31
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,990
written entirely in syllables.

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,380
You'll count 46 Hiragana
Cherokee has 85 the syllables.

33
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,880
Wow. Now here's a jump up to
Hittite with over 500 symbols. Maya,

34
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:06,750
with more than 800 and Chinese
with thousands upon thousands.

35
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,360
So we ended up with alphabets on one end,

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,880
silver berries in the middle
end logo graphic or logo,

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,960
phonetic scripts on the far side.
But now you're facing a new script,

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,430
totally unknown to you, and you
count the symbols. It has hundreds.

39
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,770
What kind of script do you think it is?

40
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,130
What if it has 20 what if it has 50 or
60 we're using this simple algorithm to

41
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:32,040
make an educated guess
about an unknown script.

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,270
Ms Things referenced conceptually
and papers about decipherment,

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,790
but I don't know what it's called.
Robinson points us back to Archibald.

44
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,170
Say someone who loved himself, some a
Syrian. So do we call it the safe test?

45
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:46,830
The Archibald heuristic pulling
a space? Yeah. Pulling a sakes.

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,520
Pulling US space does come with
challenges and drawbacks to first,

47
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,030
there's the problem that you
still can't read the text. True,

48
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,070
but before you take all of
the wind out of my sails,

49
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:58,770
please celebrate what this
handy tool can do for you.

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,480
Second scripts can emphasize things,

51
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,110
but they're not really purely
phonetic or pure loga graphs. I mean,

52
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,630
think of the mix of letters and numbers,
punctuation,

53
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,710
and even idiot graphs you find all
around you and that's just an English.

54
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,760
Perhaps the biggest problem is
how do identify distinct symbols?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,310
If you were trying to
decipher the Latin alphabet,

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,270
could you tell that all of
these are the same symbol? How?

57
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,120
What about capital letters
and lowercase letters?

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,950
Our accent marks distinct letters.
How do we count ligatures linked,

59
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,180
scripted together,

60
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:36,010
mashed together characters
or the component consonant
vowel pieces of a single

61
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:39,850
index syllable or the sound plus meaning
pieces inside of a single Chinese

62
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,684
character.

63
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,140
We have explanations for these and maybe
they're good enough for the scripts we

64
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,974
already know,

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,730
but what about trying to read an
undecipherable script like real no Romo?

66
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,250
Are these strange people looking things
to flipped a variance of a single sign

67
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,240
or are they two different sites?
True.

68
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,180
I admitted this little algorithm
doesn't pull us out of the dark,

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,990
but it gives us a starting point.
We can identify script types.

70
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,100
We can list symbols.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,550
We can then use these lists to identify
the symbols when they show up in other

72
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,670
texts with a smile on our face.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,670
Because even though this
script is still unknown to us,

74
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,270
we've devised a clever way to reach
a strange familiarity with it.

75
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,060
A big step on our way to decipher it.

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,630
I took a little time to play around with
and put together some simple code that

77
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:41,030
runs this test on any
piece of texts you give it.

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,420
It counts the number of different
symbols that are in that text.

79
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:48,380
Then uses those cutoff
numbers from earlier to guess
what kind of writing system

80
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,214
this is.

81
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,713
Yeah,

82
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,490
so let's try it for English,
the English alphabet.

83
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,730
Here's the 26 English letters.

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,120
We'll pass it down through
here and run this thing.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,640
It tells us that English is an alphabet
who'd have thought. Same thing,

86
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:11,140
but with some random sentences.
Still an alphabet.

87
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,260
Let's go for here.
A gun at down here,

88
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,820
run it and it's syllables.

89
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,770
What about Hawaiian?

90
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,830
If you two have ever shared the
misfortune of leaving Hawaii,

91
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:31,370
you may have heard this
and it's in an alphabet,

92
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,530
and then there's Kanji. Oh yes. Oh,

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,370
whole list of them and their words,
symbols.

94
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,540
Well, that's super nerdy, but thanks for
letting me play with language a bit here.

95
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,600
It's kind of Nice doing more
off the cuff video like this.

96
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,320
It's a thing right off the cuff. It's
sounded wrong for some reason. Well,

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,460
leave comments and subscribe and encourage
me to come back again. Okay, bye.
