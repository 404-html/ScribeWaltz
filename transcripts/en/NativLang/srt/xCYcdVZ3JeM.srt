1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,900
France loves French,
it's quite possible.

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:07,170
There's no other country on earth
this proud of its linguistic heritage.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,250
So in light of the attacks just days ago,
perhaps there's no tribute to Paris,

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,420
more Parisian and spending some time
grammar checking. Isis is French.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,270
Well, the world takes in the
shock of the Paris attacks.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,780
News comes in from friends telling us
there's a letter from the Islamic state

7
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:28,410
claiming full responsibility and
in perfect French, nonetheless,

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,160
always eager to justify my underused
degree in romance languages.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,920
I had to see what counts is
perfect French these days.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,190
Tracking down an image of the
communique in just a few clicks.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,210
I it and prepared to read my way through
what I would sure would be a brief

12
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,670
declaration of religious
war against the infidels.

13
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:49,050
Perfectly polished by some middlemen
translator giving me that stellar French I

14
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:54,051
was promised and at first I think I got
what I expected or religious dedication,

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,900
sacred versa and
explanation of the attacks.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,000
But handful of sentences in some
linguistic doubts bubbled up. Yes,

17
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,640
mandatory references
to align the caliphate,

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,540
but wanting humiliating his enemies.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,850
You mean wanting to humiliate?
Okay.

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,530
A La has conquered by their hand and to
cast fear in the heart of the Crusaders

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,160
we was all that has conquered by their
handed has cast fear in the heart of the

22
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:27,270
Crusaders. Okay. This is actually
a pretty common mistake that I see.

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,080
These are actually homogenous and French,
so maybe that makes some sense,

24
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,610
but it's definitely not polished.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,950
The bet that canal or hundreds of
idolaters we're gathered where hundreds of

26
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,784
idolaters,

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,390
not to mention the buttock loan is all
small like it's a familiar place in the

28
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,290
city and not a proper noun.
Sometimes I don't even know who you'd be.

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,040
Nuances at tech,
the result of his attacks.

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,700
Did you misspell visa tax?
Is this talking about their attacks,

31
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:56,070
but you used the singular
instead of the plural?

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,850
Did you get confused by just having
mentioned say clue? It's streets.

33
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:04,820
The streets of Paris and the previous
sentence, I can't tell since.

34
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,280
See here,
granted them what they were hoping for.

35
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:12,650
The martyr martyrdom
may all I accept them.

36
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm on the martyrs and
they allow us to join them.

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,170
He allow by far the parts of this thing
with the lowest linguistic weirdness

38
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:25,440
factor or the top and bottom verses
from the Koran copied punctuation at all

39
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,030
from as far as I can track it down,

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,060
this French translation
by Mohammed Hmi Doula,

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,470
a prolific writer and language lover
in his own right, but let's be honest,

42
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:35,251
it's a good bet.

43
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,250
They were pasted from one of the
free online sites that come up here.

44
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,850
They were even kind enough to start
it off with this same little blessing.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,070
There's so much strangeness to it.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,450
I think some of that linguistic
strangeness pops out in Just One word.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,400
This is the word Suda.

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,440
Sarah is a typical feminine known in
Arabic and like so many feminine nouns.

49
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,950
It comes built in with what they
call an attached t in the word Sarah.

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,650
That attached talk gives away the gender,

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,150
but make a note that tall isn't pronounced
when the word is on its own like this.

52
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,051
Instead,

53
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,030
it's a silent t that shows up in speech
only when the word takes other forms.

54
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:16,000
Other endings like when it's
the subject of a sentence,

55
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,370
there's a different noun
form for that and Arabic.

56
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,300
And that's where the difference comes
in between the English pronunciation of

57
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,950
this word Sura the Nae devised English
way to pronounce that Arabic word on its

58
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:30,670
own with the silent t and the
French pronunciation, nuts, Syrah.

59
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,750
But sue hats from the form with the nuts.
So silent t,

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,880
but this guy doesn't write the French
word so hot. He writes it this way.

61
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,690
It looks similar to your highs,
but it caught me off guard first.

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,570
There's this funny hat,
it's a circumflex.

63
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,980
Vowels often wear that hat is a decorative
piece of French language history.

64
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,760
The leftover crumbs of a French sound
that used to be there but isn't anymore.

65
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,850
The French word beast, for
example, earned itself.

66
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,670
That happened when he got
rid of its s long time ago.

67
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,970
The word for sure in French gained it
circumflex by losing its inner e and

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,180
that's after it had already erased.
It's Latins see that it had long ago.

69
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,290
So what sounded Sura
Losing French? Well, none.

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,940
There's an even bigger clue here.
There's that missing e at the end,

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,790
just like an English. Well,
almost like an English.

72
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,610
The final e can be silent in French,

73
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,490
but that doesn't mean it has
no impact on the language.

74
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,820
It does something to the letter before it.
See,

75
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,210
there are a lot of consonants that just
don't get pronounced when they're at the

76
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:38,860
end of a French word. It's why as Jack
and blowhole aren't Jackson poor rot,

77
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,120
but when that he makes its way onto
the end of a word with a silent t,

78
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,050
it stays silent. Bull,
the tea gets pronounced.

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,250
So in sue got the final,
he lets us have our tea,

80
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,190
but lop off that finally,
and I promise you,

81
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,250
any French reader will
pronounce this as a silent t.

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,520
This word is so raw and that's where it
gets strange to see if this righteous

83
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:08,071
tongue rider is all about French or his
translator on retainer is Sukha is a lot

84
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,580
harder to justify.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,750
But if he's imitating the Arabic
pronunciation of the word in isolation,

86
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,100
Swa suddenly becomes a plausible spelling.
On the other hand,

87
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,910
this spelling isn't at all what I'd
expect if someone were just translating

88
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:23,200
literally from Arabic.

89
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,610
It shows a familiarity with native Ising
Arabic words into French in a way that

90
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,400
tells us something about the culture
of that native arising process.

91
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,300
Making analogies with other French words
that come to mind and even extending

92
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:38,460
circumflex is in a standardized academic
way to compensate for that Arabic long

93
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:43,461
val and it's that Arabic minded circumflex
that makes sense when you consider

94
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,760
two other facts.
One,

95
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,600
the few other examples we can find
touting this spelling our shakes and

96
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:53,800
institutes citing specific verses in their
lectures or people setting themselves

97
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,320
up as instructors teaching
you something from the Koran,

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,470
always leaning into that formal Arabic
even when they're preaching in another

99
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:02,780
tongue to Islam.

100
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,000
Specifically this way of spelling Islam
this way is leaning into yet another

101
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,230
Arabic long val.
Now,

102
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,400
I don't mean to mislead you into thinking
that this is all a bunch of lurking

103
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,820
Arabic seeping through.
That's not what swipe is telling us.

104
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,550
This isn't the dictionary French word,

105
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:22,460
but it's not the dictionary
Arabic word either.

106
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,180
This is too productive for a literal
translation for a broader audience,

107
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,420
but it's also to communal for
a case of personal creativity.

108
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,010
And my hunch right now is it, this is
the root of my feeling of strangeness.

109
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,220
This is where the language of
this communique begins to unravel,

110
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,610
giving us a glimpse of the writer as well
as other targets in the 10th the 11th

111
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,960
the 18th Allen Small and
this simultaneously, my
reading's not English enough,

112
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:51,350
it's too close to the original,
but zoom in here closer.

113
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,270
The writer knows he's about to list a
bunch of targets so it uses the plural,

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,350
but then in mid sentence he turns to
break this list up and just three singular

115
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,190
targets and he finishes it all up
with this journalistic. But wait,

116
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,080
there's more back reference tweak.

117
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,470
It's like the first draft of a stop and
go news report tripping over itself and

118
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,120
it's all laced with the
stream of condemnation.

119
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:17,840
So constant that it's almost as if the
terms were just the only words available

120
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,280
at the time and the mind of the writer,

121
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,730
France and Germany are the two crusader
countries also allowed the idiot of

122
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,680
France. There are miscreants.
There's perversion,

123
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,460
there's a motive wanting and hoping
and shooting and how dare you.

124
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:36,461
Ing of modal verbs dressed
up as statements of fact
and of course the threat of

125
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:41,900
more to come would all sound so over
the top if only it weren't so fresh.

126
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,740
This is the product of a
mind that knows French. Yes,

127
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,440
but one that makes linguistic mistakes,

128
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,610
linguistic mistakes that showcase in
idiosyncratic language that's closer to a

129
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:57,020
certain kind of community speech of a
near of Arabic style and simple full puff

130
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,840
fumblings with political, French
News, announcement delivery.

131
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,640
It's so much closer to those things
than it is to what I was naive promised

132
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,490
would be a clear example
of perfect French,

133
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,400
but maybe my language is too flower.
You're stylized here. This is what I mean.

134
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,770
It's a heat.
He sets himself up as a preacher,

135
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,110
but a preacher that's more easier than,
than meticulous.

136
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,810
And while he is someone that wants
to instruct you, even preach to you,

137
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,050
is this on the scholar a translator?

138
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:27,050
Even though he likes to incorporate
teaks of religious scholarship,

139
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,220
he's from a subculture that readily
Arab rather than color sizes,

140
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,930
Arabic borrowings into French.

141
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,950
He distances himself from his surroundings
playing both moral judge and factual

142
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,784
reporter.

143
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,350
He knows Punam the city of lights well
enough to be disgusted by specifics,

144
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,040
but he's probably not the translator.
He's the author.

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:57,890
Yeah.
