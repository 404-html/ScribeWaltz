1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,480
Maybe you've heard that Hebrew and
Arabic are written entirely in consonants

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,550
wrong.
Here's why

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,420
you're back in old Phoenicia where it
turns out the Greeks aren't the only ones

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,510
looking to buy a vowel. Your contact
in town is still your merchant frenemy.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,720
Who reminds you of how
she traded your continent.

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,370
Alphabet across the ancient world.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,670
That object spread to every language
with even a passing resemblance to

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,640
Phoenician. Every town from
here to Carthage has some
version of her object spot.

9
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,570
The Egyptians, those stuck in their
way. Traditionalist initially,

10
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,330
these submitted speakers, loved
it, they were proud of it,

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,140
but the days are turning to
years and that love grows cold.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,080
They grumble that they're
stuck with these continents.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,900
Just consonants clamoring for vowels.

14
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,380
They get desperate and grab a few
characters to stand in for a long sound.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,060
Take a look. This symbol is originally
the stop between uh, ah, ah,

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,320
this one's a y. Uh, yes
sound and this is a Wa,

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,360
but they're about to become not these
things thanks to major moments in the

18
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,830
history of writing.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,120
This moment hits you twice because it
brings up both in innovation specific to

20
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:16,200
submit scripts and a more
general principle that kind
of bins the rules of the

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,760
alphabet game.
First,

22
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,840
it's worth reiterating that object writing
systems are viable ways to write and

23
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,890
read a language they work,
but with one obvious shortcoming,

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,040
those missing vowels can
create ambiguous situations.

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,130
But what if instead of
writing every vowel,

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,420
we just had a few helpful hinders that
suggested the presence of certain kinds

27
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:40,560
of vowels. Take this letter, what
actually they called it? Wow.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,180
Wow. Now imagine that we keep using
it in words that have the sound Wa,

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,160
but we also extend its use,

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,760
placing it between consonants for
the similar enough foul sound. Ooh,

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,200
in the old op job, you'd have to write
soon, and son with the same characters.

32
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,980
S plus in everything else is
vowels and we don't have those,

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,230
but suddenly our extended work comes in
handy. Son Doesn't have that ooo sound,

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,800
so it's still s plus in,
but soon does.

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,710
So we add in the WWE do
the same thing with Ja,

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,370
which can double as a long I and
this quirky catch in your throat.

37
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,440
Pause between uh oh a left,

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,150
which can double as a long awe and you
end up with three handy val suggestors,

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,280
the Matras Lectio, these helpful mothers
of reading that show up in Aramaic,

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,150
Hebrew, Arabic and Syriac that
these mothers don't leave.

41
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,720
They're consonant nus behind.
They still double as consonants.

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,330
The object traded the
ambiguity of a vowel.

43
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:40,350
This existence for new kinds of
ambiguity depending on context.

44
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,090
Each of these matrass may be a continent
or it might be a vowel one character,

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,660
multiple sounds.
This is a huge trend in alphabet.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,810
Why invent new characters
when you can reuse an old one?

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,610
Repurposing continents for vowels
here and there won't satisfy everyone.

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,460
These bickering scribes aren't
content with mattress like the owners.

49
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,550
They're not just trying to
tell son apart from soon.

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,030
The bickering scribes are bickering over
how to read one of their most treasured

51
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:10,000
sayings.
One says that it's such a fine point.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,630
You wouldn't understand unless you were
incredibly well versed in his language.

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,850
But he makes an analogy for you.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,130
Write the word news and a continent
only alphabet. It's in ws. Fine.

55
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,270
Now imagine that someone comes along
with their fancy consonant vowel hybrids

56
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,770
and spells the word nous in w s hmm.

57
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,630
Wait a second. He shows you a cheat
sheet he's been keeping. It's so easy.

58
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,231
He says,

59
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,440
pointing out the little dots and dashes
above and below letters to keep his

60
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,010
vowel straight.
Put them here for an awe there for an a.

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,710
You can even add them below
one of the long vowel things.

62
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:49,390
If you need to distinguish, say an
eat, nobody's confused. That's it.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,760
He won't tolerate the
vagueness any longer.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,930
Effective immediately in all important
texts where clear reading matters.

65
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,460
Everyone's to use this method.
And so for generations,

66
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:01,930
scribes would mark bell's
above and below the consonants,

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
writing bowels in what was once
a consonant, only alphabet,

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,220
but as much as the pious and
students whereby they're Dadi vowels.

69
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,150
Modern Arabic and Hebrew speakers stick
with the simple continence plus the

70
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,800
extended consonant vowel mothers.

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,220
The optional helper dots get thrown in
like a life preserver for struggling

72
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:21,880
learners or careful text,
but grownups don't need them anymore.
