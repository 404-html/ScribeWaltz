1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.350
If you and I both speak the same language,
we can communicate.
If we don't,

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:05.970
we can't.
Right?

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.920
Except consider this documentary where they interviewed someone in the sea

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.420
islands off Georgia.
He says,
ever since radio and TV came to town,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.340
our way of speaking just became more and more American.
Now we sound like them.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.520
They sound like us.
Just one problem.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
This interview has subtitles because America,

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.240
this goal is speaker understands you perfectly,

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.780
but it's not so easy to go the other way.
See,

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:35.430
sometimes when languages come together,

11
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.450
they create this really odd situation where it's easy enough for one person to

12
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.750
communicate one way,
but it's much harder in reverse.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.390
Today I want to get animated about that,

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.340
including one time I noticed it myself and even better three countries full of

15
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:54.150
people where this kind of asymmetric intelligibility is normal.

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.220
Do I finally get to use this one?
I've been sitting on it for a year.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.020
It felt like such a native laying moment,

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.670
so I'm in the store standing in line with a hand basket full of what my friend

19
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.410
Javier calls my rabbit food.

20
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.720
I'm agonizing over whether or not to put back the nuts they were on the pricey

21
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:19.130
side for what you're paying me these days.
Enter a fashionable woman.

22
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.420
She glides over to the fancy tea juice potion section,

23
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.290
the one that's for the $8 plus crowd,
not the five 99 Oh,

24
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.790
isn't that a little pricey for nuts crowd seconds later,
I swear out of nowhere,

25
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.570
one of the employees is right next to her unboxing stuff.

26
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.520
I hear the eagerness in his voice when he asks,
you need help finding anything?

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.130
She turns and sounds come out of her mouth,
but no words or wait,

28
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.760
no,

29
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.380
she's speaking Italian are selfless helper doesn't flinch.

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.750
He switches from English on the spot.

31
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.400
No momentum lost the to exchange a bit of banter and he shows her down an aisle

32
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:00.320
and their voices fade into the store.

33
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.670
There's something I forgot to mention though and it's why the moment stuck with

34
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:09.260
me.
When the employees switched,
he spoke Spanish.
Yeah.

35
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.740
By noon [inaudible] which I find quite lovely.

36
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.690
Two languages.
We're crossing paths,
but in a lopsided way.

37
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.070
He was clearly having an easier time helping her.
Then the other way around.

38
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.020
Why?
Well,
we could come up with reasons he's eager to help.

39
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.300
Maybe he's heard Italian before,

40
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.310
maybe he's used to juggling languages in short motive and opportunity,

41
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.360
but one more factor can come into play in situations like this,

42
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.830
the languages themselves,
to see how,

43
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:46.250
let's visit a place where this kind of communication happens every day.

44
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.930
This frozen looking area at the top of Europe is home to a bunch of languages,

45
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.830
plus a ton of dialects,
but focus in on the Scandinavian,

46
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:59.270
north Germanic languages,
Swedish,
Norwegian,
Danish.

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.810
For most of us understanding another language takes study and time,

48
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.580
but Scandinavians are lucky.

49
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.210
Their languages are close enough that they can go next door and mostly

50
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:14.770
communicate semi communication style.
It's like a triangle,

51
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.870
a beautiful triangle of understanding.

52
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.730
This is mutual intelligibility and it is glorious,

53
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.270
but the triangle isn't evenly balanced.

54
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.830
I hear it's much harder to semi communicate in Swedish and Danish than it is in

55
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.090
Swedish and Norwegian,
and it gets even more on equal in each pair.

56
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.440
If you're Danish,

57
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.450
Swedish is easier for you than if you're a Swede hearing Danish.
Hmm.

58
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.620
So unfair.
It's asymmetric intelligibility,

59
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.120
but wow,
that's a lot of syllables.
We could try to boil this down to,

60
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.280
like I said before,
motive and opportunity,

61
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.200
but what if it's not the people but the languages themselves that are creating

62
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.460
Scandinavia as a symmetry?
How could we tell?
Well,

63
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.510
the languages are close enough that their grammar and mostly vocabulary don't

64
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.040
change much from tongue to tongue.

65
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.250
The big difference is in how they get pronounced.

66
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.840
So here's how it's Swedes says,
Copenhagen shopping hum.

67
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.090
And now here's a Dane.

68
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.860
Smart people decided to measure this difference with the live in shooting

69
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.710
distance.
I'm not your math teacher or your math channel,

70
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.120
but here's the function.

71
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.700
If you really want to play with it in it's recursive glory,

72
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.870
I'll honestly be doing the same so we can nerd together,
solidarity,

73
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.910
the results,
estimate what it takes to transform one word into another.

74
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.210
So how far apart cognates should sound Danish cognates should be more distant

75
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:47.920
from Swedish than the way Norwegian say.

76
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:52.921
Then Swedish and Danish should be extremes and Norwegians should settle down

77
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
right in the middle.

78
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.540
One of those authors teamed up for another study hoping to do even better using

79
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.390
entropy.
Again,
not your math teacher here.

80
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.370
That's my mom's job and she rocks at it.

81
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.020
Basically model the uncertainty Scandinavians feel when they're semi

82
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:11.890
communicating and guessing.
It sounds an example.

83
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.990
Danish grammatical endings can only have one vowel in them,
but they're Swedish.

84
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.610
Cognates can have three.

85
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.960
This creates uncertainty for Swedes listening to Danish,

86
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.480
so using conditional entropy.
Just how uncertain is Swedish given Danish,

87
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.020
how intelligible is that intelligibility?
Well,

88
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:33.670
calculating with a bunch of cognates,

89
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.360
it looks like Danish to Swedish should be more complicated,

90
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.660
higher conditional entropy,
then Swedish to Danish.

91
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.970
Swedish and Norwegian are lower,

92
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.690
but we expect more of a challenge going from Norwegian to Swedish than the other

93
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:51.160
way.
Denmark should understand Norway better than vice versa.
Really?

94
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:53.800
Danes should get everyone better than they get.
The Danes.

95
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.890
Danish does have a reputation for being tricky one.

96
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.720
We could do a whole animated tangent and danishes very evolved sounds,
but here,

97
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.340
one more time.
Mountain enough said,

98
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.930
so now we have numbers.
Guessing what intelligibility should be.

99
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.830
What happens if we invite real speakers in for a real test?

100
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.090
Ask Scandinavians who use one of the languages at home to listen to a reading in

101
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.960
another language.
Then quiz them.
How well did they understand?

102
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.640
Did high entropy predict low intelligibility?
Let's see.

103
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.110
Danes have an easier time understanding Swedes and vice versa.
Check.

104
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.950
Norwegians and Swedes understand each other better.
Perfect.

105
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.020
Except wait,

106
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.100
why are Norwegian speakers having such an easy time with Danish?

107
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.480
I'm reading that right?
Yeah.
Danish should be hard for no regions,

108
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.260
but these results make it look like Norwegians understand everything better than

109
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:56.000
everyone.
Why?
Well,
researchers speculate.

110
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.040
I'll have to leave it a mystery this time,

111
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.090
but the reasons probably bring us back to motive and opportunity.

112
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.460
These three factors make intelligibility happened not just in Scandinavia but

113
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:12.380
around the world.
Written Estonian looks more like finished to fins than written.

114
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.110
Finished does to Estonians Lao and Thai or close,

115
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.170
but you allow speakers out there have a leg up,

116
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.840
possibly thanks to Thai soap operas and magazines,

117
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.050
Jamaican Patois speakers understanding English,
but the reverse isn't it?

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.720
Torricelli vaccine and my amazing patrons pointed out Quebec French for per

119
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:30.554
regions,

120
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.590
Romanian for Italians and Spanish for many kids in the u s so the next time you

121
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.420
can't understand someone who understands you,

122
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.610
it might be because they're motivated.

123
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.140
Maybe they want to help a well-dressed Italian.
It could be exposure.

124
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.660
They've met your words before,
like Gullah,

125
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.400
but most intriguing of all it may be because something about your language tilts

126
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:56.560
the odds in their favor.
Just because you don't understand someone,

127
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.710
it's no guarantee.
They can't understand you.

128
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.990
Thanks to my patrons for voting for this and for keeping the channels,

129
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:07.780
heart beating and tongue talking.
Oh,

130
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.500
let me know if you have any asymmetric intelligibility stories of your own.

131
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.600
I'm collecting any good ones and stick around and subscribed for language.
