1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.300
Okay.

2
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 1>What does this child's game teach us about?</v>

3
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:06.900
The history of writing something basic but incredibly inventive.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.050
You learned how to write with symbols at Stanford words,
logo,
graphs,

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.350
and you saw just how many logo graphs you need to write.
Well,

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.020
logo graphs for everything under the sun and the moon,

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.610
including the sun and the moon.
But isn't this getting impractical?

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.400
Do we really need a symbol for every word?

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.430
Surely the madness can't go on forever.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.620
Say hello to this smart rogue who's about to solve your problem with an innocent

11
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.460
mistake.
His father has been counting sheep literally,

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.120
and he just asked his son to record a measly line in his budget.

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.700
10 sheep for uncle.
The son writes the 10 and the logo graph for sheep,

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.040
but uncle,
he pauses and scratches his head.
He go to play with his friends.

15
00:00:57.041 --> 00:01:00.700
He writes the character for ankle 10 sheet ankle.

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.110
He hurries away without a second thought,
but don't take his invention lightly.

17
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.710
If you've ever played fill in the blank or guessing games where you have to

18
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:12.520
sound out picture words you've seen and used this principle for yourself,

19
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.880
but it's not just for quirky puzzles with funny solutions.

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.710
The name for this is another major moments in the history of writing.

21
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.240
The name for this is is rebuilt.

22
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.550
This familiar language game lets you look beyond the meaning of a character and

23
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.070
use it simply for its sound son.

24
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:35.071
Sounds like sun and by extension perhaps soon and sewn logo graphs like the

25
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:39.640
symbol for Sun could already be read his words now with the Rita's principle in

26
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:43.000
your pocket,
look at graphs can also be read as sounds.

27
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.960
This isn't just useful for getting ancient uncle his ancient sheep.

28
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.650
Once as tech city planners finished building their stunning capital in the

29
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:54.190
middle of a lake,
the Venice of the new world,
they know [inaudible].

30
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.560
Their scribes needed a weight of right it's name.

31
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.860
They've been using what amounts to basic picture writing.

32
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.390
Since [inaudible] Tepe learn has a stone tay and a cactus,

33
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.470
naturally it's natural to write it with two fairly obvious glyphs.

34
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.070
Then these become not just symbols,
meaning cactus in stone,

35
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.840
but symbols for the noises they noche de Blonde,

36
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.600
making them just as much rebus fun as those puzzles you solved as a kid and now

37
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:20.770
you know the name for those.

38
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.820
You also know why there's a cactus on top of a stone in Mexico's flag.

39
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.440
It's not just for show

40
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.940
how alike does a sound like pronunciation have to be,

41
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.470
which sounds can we chop off pit the Egyptians against the Sumerians.

42
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:36.340
One more time.

43
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.440
Egyptian hieroglyphs cut off the initial consonant or less often two or three

44
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:44.350
consonants from the original word Sumerians.

45
00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:48.250
On the other hand with their Qa a form take whole syllables.

46
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.340
These two paths don't just add some local flavor.

47
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.450
Reversing out consonants doesn't just impact ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

48
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.730
It leaves a legacy for later spinoffs.

49
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.230
The mentality that these either red as Loga graphs or they stand for consonants.

50
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.580
Cuneiform leaves at different legacy,
completely unrelated languages.

51
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.600
We'll spend thousands of years of borrowing and reborrowing cuneiform to write

52
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.810
their own words,
but each time the symbols are red is low.

53
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:18.040
Good graphs or as syllables.
Flexibility is key here.

54
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.960
Look at this Egyptian hieroglyph.

55
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.290
It can be read as the logo graph for mouth or AA or as the continent or this

56
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.700
character could be read as the logo graph,

57
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.530
meaning house or it could stand for the consonant per the two consonants and the

58
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.230
Egyptian word.
Conveniently in Egyptian,

59
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.440
the little slashy below lets you know when it's a pure logo graph.

60
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.460
The ritas discovery brings up the tension between meaning and sound.

61
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.920
Is Riding phonetic or semantic?

62
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.940
Is it about encoding the meaning of words or encoding?
Speech sounds,

63
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.530
the old logo graphs.
We're fundamentally a meaning writing system.
Sure.

64
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.690
This sounds like ray in Egyptian,

65
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.740
but what's crucial is that this is a logo graph for the word meaning mouth.

66
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.770
Rebus writing takes a big step towards sound writing.

67
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.580
This will come to stand for the continent or regardless of meaning.

68
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.330
It may come as a surprise,
but once discovered,

69
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.160
sound writing doesn't oust meaning writing not at all.
Indeed,

70
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:18.370
early writers notice that phonetic writing brings up a problem,

71
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.030
a problem you probably missed because of your comfort with sound writing.

72
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.660
A problem that meaning writing can solve.
Brace yourself.

73
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:29.260
History because Loga graphs are about to make a comeback.

74
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>
