00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.740
Have you ever had someone explain grammar to you?

2
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.390
Maybe you had a slip of the tongue and a know it all friend of yours didn't

3
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:22.391
hesitate to point out your mistake or maybe you were learning a new language and

4
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:26.580
your teacher told you how to pronounce a certain letter in different contexts.

5
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.510
Chances are these people gave you linguistic rules that went something like,

6
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.901
oh,

7
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:37.901
this one plural s sounds like z after voiceless consonants,

8
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.210
but like zs after voiced consonants,

9
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.640
rules like this one are supposed to tell you how the language works and what's

10
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.890
more.
They're not supposed to be broken.

11
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.620
A paradigm called optimality theory takes issue with this approach.

12
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.160
Instead of applying unbreakable rules to language,

13
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.490
optimality theory contends that viable competing constraints do a better job of

14
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:08.600
explaining how language works.
Before we take a peek at the guts of this model,

15
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.430
let's get a sense of the difference between a rule based and a constraint based

16
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:14.264
approach.

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.590
Say you have a very principled friend who lives life by a bunch of rules.

18
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:23.450
She really sticks to one of those rules is don't stay up late.

19
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.360
Another friend of yours doesn't have a rule like this but does have a bunch of

20
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.430
preferences and demands on her time.

21
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.080
Things like get enough sleep and play video games for fun.

22
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.210
The first friend expects her rule to be followed,
never broken,

23
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.830
so it's inviolable.

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.460
The second friend has a list of constraints.

25
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.290
She ranks the constraints by priority.
Sleep above games,

26
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.930
a situation arises.
Both friends are invited to an all night game fest.

27
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.220
The first friend checks her rule.
The plan doesn't pass,

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.380
so the outcome is she doesn't go.

29
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.110
The second friend compares her constraints and since she can't sleep and play

30
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.650
games,
going to sleep violates the low rank constraint.

31
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.320
We'll playing video games violates the hiring constraint.

32
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.680
She chooses the best outcome,

33
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.220
the optimal candidate going to sleep.

34
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.600
Both friends ended up sleeping.
So our debate isn't over the outcome.

35
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.700
It's about the process.

36
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.980
Optimality theory claims to be a better model even for what the first friend is

37
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:41.300
doing in this situation.
Well,
at least when we take it back to language.

38
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.020
So the same goes when we consider the input bag plus plural s with constraints

39
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:52.640
like match,
voicing and keep the sounds identical.

40
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.000
We could end up choosing between the candidates bags and bags.

41
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.740
What's the output going to be since the pronunciation bags incurs the least

42
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.910
serious violations here,
it's our optimal candidate.

43
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.800
Other candidates might do even worse,
like if we added bag

44
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.670
this little evaluation table here,

45
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:21.490
it gets called a Tablo in optimality theory.

46
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.420
Notice one more time that the constraints are ranked and viable.

47
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.620
It's also proposed that there's a constant tension between marketing this

48
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.550
constraints once that shape boards and sounds and faithfulness constraints,

49
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.950
ones that keep words and sounds the same.

50
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.830
I just wanted to leave you with the gist of the basics of optimality theory.

51
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.590
I'm sure you have other competing constraints on your own time,

52
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.470
so thanks for taking a moment to learn.
