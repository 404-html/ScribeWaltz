00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
In my last rant all about the ridiculousness it takes just to write a simple

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:05.670
sentence in Japanese,

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.110
the list of complications kept growing and growing and growing until we threw

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:12.810
that Kaji bomb under the mix,
like a writing systems Ninja,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.740
but I didn't even get into the stuff that really takes Japanese Kanji over the

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.690
top,
making them seriously awkward.
Don't forget,

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.380
don't you dare forget that Japan borrowed it's characters from China.

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.770
That's important because it explains what happens next.

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.960
When a con g came on the boat across the seat,

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.540
it brought its Chinese pronunciation along with it.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
But Chinese and Japanese are two very different languages with two very

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.170
different pronunciations systems.

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.830
So each character didn't get pronounced the way somebody from China would say
it,

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.290
but the way it's somebody from Japan would hear it.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.720
Here's how I imagine that history.
Well,
hello,
who might you be hot?
Okay,

16
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:56.430
con no hun.
Yes,
gun.
Nice to meet you con.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.150
And that is just the tip of the support or ice sculpture.

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.650
What makes this confusing cultural mismatch even better is that the acoustic

19
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:06.930
exchange happened a long time ago.

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.020
So it's the way characters from old China sounded to people in old Japan and

21
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.250
since like I explained last time,

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
most characters are a bad game of charades with one part of the character

23
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:19.350
telling you what the word sounds like.

24
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.980
The confusion coming out of this phonological telephone game mix.

25
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.550
That vague sounds like hint,
even more vague and Japanese.

26
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.060
The fancy term for this cultural mishmash of Kaji pronunciation is the Sino

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.810
Japanese reading.
In Japanese,

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.340
they call it the literally sound reading,
which makes sense.

29
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.880
It's your reading the Kanji with its Chinese sound and of course there's more

30
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.700
than one way to skin and on Naomi there's goal.

31
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.050
That's the classical Wu pronunciation of the characters from the fifth century.

32
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.940
Then came the condom,

33
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.750
which are Tang dynasty pronunciation starting in the seventh century,

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.590
Dole and pronunciations made their way to Japan from the later dynasties.

35
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.850
The final O'Neil me is gone.

36
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.520
Your outlier pronunciations and even mistakes that became conventional and stuck

37
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.440
around over the centuries.
So yeah,

38
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.370
don't be surprised when the own Naomi for a Kanji you're learning is actually a

39
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.800
bunch of different Sino Japanese pronunciations.

40
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.510
This has amusing consequences.
If you go to zen ceremonies,

41
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.680
they recite this passage in classical Chinese.
It's called the heart sutra,

42
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.680
but this is Japan and these are all Kanji.

43
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.030
So how do you think the suture gets pronounced?
In classical Chinese?
No,

44
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.860
in standard Chinese?
No,
in Japanese,
no,

45
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.500
it's just chanted as a long string of O'neil.

46
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.520
Me basically resulting in jibberish in both languages conjure.

47
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.490
You don't just have on your me though.
They also have,

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.070
like I said before,
Japanese and Chinese are two very different languages,

49
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.580
which means that all of these own yeoman getting borrowed century after century

50
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:55.920
are basically foreign vocabulary words.

51
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.190
But do you think the native Japanese words just stepped aside and made room for

52
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.530
all the shiny new Chinese terms?
No.

53
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.800
The incoming Kanji had to fit Japanese to Japanese words got matched to Chinese

54
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.330
characters.
It seemed like a good fit at the time.

55
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.420
Here is the character for cart or vehicle.

56
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.610
It has a few Sino Japanese when Yo me,
but the basic one is shot,

57
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.210
but the Japanese already had a word for this.
Good Houma.

58
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.900
So this character can represent any of these pronunciations.

59
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.030
It wasn't an exact science though.

60
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.120
Just like you can have multiple Chinese pronunciations for each Kanji.

61
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.330
Why not have multiple Japanese meaning readings too?

62
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.820
There's even one more bunch of readings to add to this list downloading.

63
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.030
It's for proper names and it's usually yet another native Japanese pronunciation

64
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:46.450
for the character and the excitement doesn't stop there.

65
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.760
Domato cheap because it's time to forget the reading.

66
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.310
Fun and think about all the writing fun you could have with these.

67
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.630
That is where you really get to play with this systems within systems madness,

68
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.720
I mean a amazingness.
That is the conduit.

69
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.080
If you really want to play fast and loose with the history and meaning of these

70
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.140
characters,
you can switch in some [inaudible].

71
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.930
Those are Kanji characters used just for the way they sound.

72
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.750
When you see Sushi written this way,

73
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.420
that's some Improv at Digi stuff going on.

74
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.600
Neither of those characters is anything to do with the meaning of that word.

75
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.070
Sometimes Japan just builds its own characters following the logic of Chinese

76
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:25.300
character composition just makes characters up because you can be productive

77
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:29.620
with this charades game.
These are called [inaudible] country characters.

78
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.870
Sometimes there are newer ways,

79
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.680
an older ways of writing the exact same character gene,

80
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.240
gene QG dying.

81
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.500
Sometimes a character gets way too complicated or you're just feeling creative

82
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:45.100
and you need to abbreviate it and one way or another,
and by abbreviate,

83
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.850
I mean turn it into a completely unrecognizable thing that I'll sit there trying

84
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.570
to look up like,
what is that?
It wasn't all my official Kaji list.
Yeah.

85
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.800
Could you and mastering one character is only a fraction of the battle.

86
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.440
Often characters don't mean what you think they mean,

87
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.300
or they really don't mean much on their own.

88
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.090
Japanese loves to combine characters to make a word.

89
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.190
You go Japan stack those characters,

90
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.320
and then once you're comfortable with Multicom g words level up again to tackle

91
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.940
those terse little three character or for character proverbs that pack some deep

92
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.040
meaning in just a very few syllables.

93
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.110
This is not even where things get out of hand.
I promise you.
You see,

94
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:27.180
it's not the quirky syllables from last time.

95
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.960
It's not the quagmire that you get into when you start memorizing all the Kanji

96
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:33.060
with their sound ratings.
There meaning readings.

97
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.860
There's substitutions and abbreviations.

98
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.030
It's the untamed beast that only rears its head when you first put eat to that

99
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:43.230
fresh sheet of Japanese paper,
which looks a lot like regular paper.

100
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.240
Stop and think about how super intricate the characters get with all their

101
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:50.940
little lines and strokes and dash.
Well,

102
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:54.930
I tell you in all seriousness that there's officially a right way and a wrong

103
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:59.670
way to write each and every single mark in these things.
You made it this far,

104
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.950
but I need you next time to help me through this.

105
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.440
Stick around and subscribe for language.
