00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.730
There's so many tough,
frustrating,
crazy,

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:06.240
ridiculous things about learning Chinese characters and Japanese Kanji.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.240
I know I've already shared some,
but just one more

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.990
before you can even read or write a basic sentence in mandarin or Japanese or if

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.680
for some reason you just really want to get crazy into medieval Korean or old

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.710
Vietnamese,
you need to know symbol after symbol.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.890
So when I set out to learn symbol after hundreds of symbols,

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.570
I already knew I was in for it.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.050
And then when I learned about the different pronunciations,
the meanings,

10
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.190
the systems in the subsystems within the characters,
it just threw me a Kaji,

11
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.300
punched the face and then the gut and then the face again,
just for good measure.

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.740
But I was really caught off guard by a killer Hawn below that almost knocked me

13
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.370
right out.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.360
And that killer blow was all about the way you have to write each character.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.150
It started innocently enough,

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.350
they taught me a handful of easy characters and how to write three or four

17
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:58.910
strokes in each.
So stroke one,
no,
no,

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.240
wrong stroke one
stroke too.

19
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.810
No,
no,
no.
This is stroke too.
Okay.

20
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.650
Stroke three good.
You're getting it.

21
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
And stroke for as my sensei used to say almost.
Okay.

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.000
Congratulations.
You just wrote the character for day.
You're an honor.

23
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.000
A calligrapher under the next one.

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.160
One just like before too.
Oh wait.
Uh,

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.610
that goes over and down again,
right?
Yeah.
There it is.

26
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.260
Three.
Nope.
Okay,
fine.
Three,

27
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.460
four,
five.
Okay.

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.140
There's kind of a pattern here,

29
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.180
so at this point I'm starting to think it's just their form of good penmanship.

30
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.940
Sure.
It's all number Leonne orderly in sequential,
but I'm game there.

31
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.720
What a game it is.
This is not just good writing like in western calligraphy.

32
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.860
As I go along,

33
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.550
I learned that this is actually a basic part of writing the characters.

34
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.390
If you don't know the stroke orders,
you just plain don't know how to write.

35
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.900
That's it.
So like this one followed by this one,

36
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:10.170
followed by this one to make a box.
That's the right way to do it.

37
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.580
This one goes up,
not down.
This one has a swishy tail.

38
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.960
Make these lines before these ones,
but then do these other ones after this part.

39
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.690
This character has six strokes.

40
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.660
Not For and this character has 20 strokes,

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.590
not 21 don't miss any of these up.
All right,
we are watching you.

42
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.920
Fortunately I think to myself,
hey self,

43
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.990
I've already spotted some patterns.
I test those patterns out and what a relief.

44
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.390
I ended up getting good mileage out of some of them.

45
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.930
It got to the point where once I saw this,

46
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.910
but then soon I saw this after training young one.

47
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.990
You can see it too,

48
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
but there was more beneath the surface for one thing and you had to see this

49
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:57.710
coming patterns can change the left side.
Downstroke plus right side,

50
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.120
right plus downstroke starter Combo played like a drum beat in my head,

51
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.610
leaving me with a false sense of security.

52
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.600
So I fell victim to characters that split and reordered those same angles.

53
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.350
Oh Song.
You are a beautiful melody,
but you are a nasty character.

54
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.990
And even when rote formulas worked for one character,

55
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.330
they broke when more strokes were thrown into the mix.

56
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.440
Remember that Rice Patty from earlier,
it gets written one way on its own,

57
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.570
but another way is part of the character for hometown and in China that's not

58
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:30.010
even the right rice patty.
They switch up these two strokes.
If you're in China,

59
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.870
don't mix them up.
So yes,

60
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:36.040
stroke orders can change for the same character in different combinations and

61
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:40.210
yes,
stroke orders for the same character can differ between China and Japan.

62
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.780
It might not be the order of the strokes that changes either.

63
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.380
The first time I noticed this was the character for equipment,

64
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.710
it's big line gets attached and China and then the one for copy had a roof,

65
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.280
but as missing the normal top dot that every other roof I was familiar with has,

66
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.690
and there's a newer way to write this character and an older way.

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.130
In Japan there are new characters with fewer strokes and older characters with

68
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.050
more strokes.
And in China,

69
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.140
they're simplified characters that often have a lot fewer strokes,

70
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.250
but the fewer stroke characters in China aren't the same ones you'll find in

71
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:15.084
Japan.

72
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.820
Say even the patterns I thought I was seeing before turned out not to be hard

73
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.850
and fast rules,
but keen observer that you are.

74
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.700
Maybe you can step back and notice something that I didn't.

75
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.840
These are all straight lines,
stroke patterns.
It's just the direction,

76
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:30.490
the order that we're squabbling over here.

77
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.510
And that's true until you meet cursive scripts and other ways of writing.

78
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:38.380
The characters that have whimsical,
swishes and circles hits a lot to take in.

79
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.370
But it's important.
There is a right way and there is a wrong way.

80
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:45.760
And people will notice if you write the wrong way.
But you know what?

81
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.650
Millions upon millions of humans learned to write this way.
Ridiculous.
Yes,

82
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.800
but I never said it was impossible,
but what do you think?

83
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.970
Lay It on me in the comments and stick around at subscribe for language.
