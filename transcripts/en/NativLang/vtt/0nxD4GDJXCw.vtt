1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.300
Ancient.
Sparta had its own way of speaking Greek.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.030
They needed it for all their gruff one liners,

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.510
but history pushed them aside as a common dialect spearheaded by Athens swept

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.690
the Greek world.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.370
Yet I'm told there are small pockets in the south of Greece where people still

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.990
cling to the old words.
The last remnant of the spartan tongue.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.180
A school master leads his young students up the hillsides around Leonia cassette

8
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:32.370
recorders in hand.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.150
They're on a self appointed mission to capture the words of their elders who

10
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.640
speak a Greek very different from the rest of Greece.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.020
These aging villagers are among the few left who know it for him.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.290
It used to be a quirky way of speaking at home around the table,

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290
but now he sees in it alone,

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.560
descendant of doric crumbling into yet another Greek artifact.

15
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.370
Doric.
Yes,
the dialect of ancient Sparta.
Well,

16
00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:01.290
Athens forge trade routes,
generated culture and spoke attic.

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.550
Sparta was busy speaking doric and grabbing all the barracks upgrades.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.350
They said things like [inaudible] ha ha.
Mete out,

19
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.290
of course sputter but in Athens,

20
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:18.291
those Oz change to air hammer method Hemera or get this spot,

21
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:25.251
that spot Taz long alphas and military might couldn't stop attic from growing

22
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.420
into the Greek to replace all Greeks with one compromise.

23
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.870
It wasn't fair to ask everyone to give up all of their own words.

24
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.620
Why not mix the dialects a bit?
So the coin aid,
the Alec Toes,

25
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.270
common dialect was born.

26
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.800
The Hellenic world expanded and coin could be heard from Turkey to Egypt,

27
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.700
to Italy in Syria.
If you head down to Sparta today,

28
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.100
the Greek there is the same stuff you hear up.

29
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:55.101
And Athena Spartans even ended up with the Athenian pronunciation for their own

30
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.730
city.
Nowadays it's,
well,
it's spotty,

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.540
spotty.
So where did that Doric ah,

32
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.080
go an 80 kilometer drive down,

33
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:11.910
a thin parched road morphs into a twisty mountain passageway that finally leads

34
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:14.930
you to this school.
Master's quaint town of low neilia.

35
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.690
You'll know you've arrived when you spot these blue bilingual signs.

36
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.420
Proudly touting the local village or Greek on the top end.

37
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.200
A translation in real Greek.
One signed,

38
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:27.180
clearly spells out the languages name

39
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.660
Conica short and easy,
like any good Greek name.
Did you catch it?

40
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.860
So Go Nika,
blah,
blah.
If that left you speaking in tongues,
call it Saccone.

41
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:43.620
Ian,
this might come from the word laconic,
not as in Wid,

42
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.000
but as in Laconia.

43
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.060
The region around Sparta coincidence or is there a real ancient connection here?

44
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720
Well,
we already have one way to test their spartan this.

45
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.170
Do they preserve that Dork Alpha where Athenian say Etha listening intently to

46
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.030
the children's cassettes.
One by one.
The answers turn up.

47
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.100
They say Mati they say I our her,
but it gets better.

48
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.970
The mother is Amati and the day is our mirror.

49
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.480
These are as exactly where Athens gives us e that's enough to raise eyebrows,

50
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.050
but there's another rarity.

51
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.300
Ancient Greek croon clothes and Sukkah once had an Ooh,

52
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360
that got fronted to then your takis most sounds turning into,

53
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.500
he left Greece with Breanne course and sicker but Sacconi.

54
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.940
Ian Still keeps in old,
Ooh.
Shuko for nose.

55
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.290
Sukkah for figs,
but other words are unexpected.

56
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.860
If we're hunting for a perfectly preserved dialect,
elegant,

57
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.330
declensions and conjugations that stood the test of time in modern Greek get

58
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.550
tossed aside.
When we listen to Taccone Ian,

59
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.000
the fancy forms of a verb like graphical,
get off.

60
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.380
He's going to figure out if we make a or reduced to the poultry participle,

61
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.960
I get off.
Not Very Archaic.

62
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.930
Neither is the way they sometimes say their case.

63
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.840
Fig and figs are Sukkot and Sukkah,

64
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.370
but now insert Jay and fig and figs,
Sukkot,

65
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.720
chest Sukkah.
This sound change isn't even unique.
Indeed.

66
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.330
Hellenic linguists have a term for the extreme form of it.

67
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.140
See duckies most pronouncing Chen Xi as say,
and c,

68
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.380
but then you hear them utter a Little v.

69
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.710
When they say [inaudible] the sheep and of Anoxia,

70
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.660
the U in Greece.
Those words are supposed to start with a vowel.

71
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.960
Everyone does it.
Even before the Parthenon was built,

72
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.780
they were doing it to scholars.
The reason for this,

73
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:48.160
a barren victims as clear as it is,
tantalizing,
archaic.

74
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:52.390
Greek once had a sound woo written with a dynamic,
but it lost it.

75
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.640
The root one long ago evolved into [inaudible].
Not here though.

76
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.970
Here the sheeps and use still start with a very archaic consonant now pronounced

77
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.140
the pieces,
the artifacts,
the innovations fit.

78
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.480
This is a descendant of Doric,
but it's not frozen in time.
It's living,

79
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:14.380
it's productive.

80
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.700
And it's so distinct that linguists classify it as a separate language.

81
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.930
What would it be like if the dialect of the spartan survived and evolved on its

82
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:23.860
own until today?

83
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.430
Like Saccone in a country where coin A's legacy standard Greek reaches even the

84
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:33.910
most nestled towns.
So konijn struggles to keep its footing,

85
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.050
I guess tape recorders and uphill field trips can only do so much.

86
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.210
So while you once thought of Spartans as ancient warriors whose faces and voices

87
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.310
like buried in the ruins of this town,

88
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.310
perhaps with the help of Hellenic linguistics,

89
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.310
you can find them in the faces and voices of another town,

90
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.950
the last remnant of the spartan tongue.

91
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.800
Stick around and subscribe for language.
