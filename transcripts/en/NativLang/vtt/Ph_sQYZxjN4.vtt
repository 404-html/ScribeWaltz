1
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.290
Continuing along through the grammar of words.

2
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.600
This time we're going to focus on the part of speech known as the verb.

3
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.560
We'll study a variety of properties that are grammatically marked on verbs in

4
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:21.610
many languages.

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.530
Let's start with person number and gender number in gender.

6
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:30.550
We've already discussed with nouns and they work similarly with verbs.

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.200
A verb might take an ending to represent a singular number versus a plural

8
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.034
number.

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.300
Consider the example in English he talks versus they talk.

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.990
Talks is marked in the singular and talk is unmarked or maybe marked with a zero

11
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.560
morpheme.
In the plural,

12
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.490
the verb is marked for number class and gender is sometimes marked on verbs to

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.300
there are languages like Hebrew,
Aramaic and Arabic.

14
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.330
The Semitic languages that distinguished gender in their verb formation person

15
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:05.140
is something we haven't covered yet.

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.390
Grammatical person actually refers to the distance of removal from the speaker,

17
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.580
so I'm talking to you.
You're the second person on the first person.

18
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.870
Somebody else.
That is neither me nor you will be the third person,

19
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.510
but person doesn't indicate number.
So if there's a group of us,
in other words,

20
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:28.570
if it's in the plural,
we are the first person.

21
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.070
You all are the second person and they are the third person plural.

22
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.020
It's not at all uncommon for languages to mark person grammatically on the verb.

23
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.170
In early modern English speakers said something like,

24
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.230
I say [inaudible] but he say it and they're the verb ending reflects the person.

25
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.970
If you're learning another Indo European language,
person number,

26
00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:53.410
endings are common site.

27
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.290
Let's move on to tense aspect and mood tents is the time of the verb.

28
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.630
It's when the action takes place.

29
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.930
So verbs tense might indicate that it happened in the past such as I said versus

30
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.050
I say,
it might indicate that it happens in the future.

31
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.580
In English we do this pair frantically,

32
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.750
I will say rather than a future tense ending,

33
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.940
but the romance languages for example,
do have future tense endings.

34
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.370
So you say the day in Spanish,

35
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.550
in Italian [inaudible] in French [inaudible] there's an inflection and it shows

36
00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:34.150
you that the action takes place in the future.
It's a future tense.

37
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.410
So the basic tenses past,
present and future.
Makes Sense.

38
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.390
Aspect refers not to win.
The action takes place,

39
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:47.950
but the flow of the action,
so something is done at a specific point in time.

40
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:51.790
If it has a definite start and ending point,
it's perfective.

41
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.760
If it does not have a definite start and ending point,

42
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:59.761
it would be imperfectly and there are a variety of other aspects we could talk

43
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.860
about.
For example,
the for quantitative

44
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.370
English distinguishes these [inaudible] so we have a progressive aspect.

45
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.390
I am going versus a perfective were simple aspect.
I go,

46
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.340
these are both present tense action so the tense doesn't change,

47
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.370
but the aspect does mood to some degree reflects the speakers attitude or

48
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.200
judgment about the action taking place.

49
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.030
Something that is happening would normally be put in the declarative or

50
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:31.864
indicative mood.

51
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.060
Those types of moods that indicate facts or just plain statements are often

52
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:40.660
known as WRAL has moods because they referenced something real.

53
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.260
Other moods are often called Erie Alice Moods.

54
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.170
This is just one way of categorizing moods.

55
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.650
Irrel his moods include hypothetical moods like the conditional and other moods

56
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.180
that might be a bit more emotional,
like the imperative mood.
So if I say go,

57
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.430
that's the imperative mood,
but if I just say you are going,
that's a declarative.

58
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.900
It's a statement of fact.

59
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.070
In one case I'm stating something that's unreal but wished for and in the other

60
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.330
case something that Israel,

61
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440
another mood you will run into in European languages is the subjunctive and

62
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:20.650
that's a counterfactual mood that demonstrates that the action isn't necessarily

63
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:21.484
the case.

64
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.860
So for instance in English we can say if I were you with the subjunctive form of

65
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:31.630
the verb be,
we don't say I were outside of that subjunctive which is because the

66
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:35.560
counterfactual or hypothetical statement triggered the use of the subjunctive

67
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.100
mood.
The same thing would be set in any romance language

68
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.650
in many languages,

69
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:45.820
questions and negations are also moods in Japan.

70
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.470
The question and he must Scott can be answered with the negative Adema saying

71
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.070
which is marked with the suffix for the negative mood.

72
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.530
Another property of verbs is voice which details the relationship between the

73
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.230
action and those participating in the action.

74
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100
The basic voices of active and passive active voice includes all of the examples

75
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.030
we've used for verbs so far.

76
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.870
If something is done that requires the passive voice,

77
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.070
the passive voice in English is formulated with B and a past participle.

78
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.300
But other languages do things differently.
You can compare Latin,

79
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.080
which actually tax on suffixes to the root to form a passive.

80
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.660
So for instance,
we have AML in the active I love,
but onward,

81
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.030
I am loved in the passive.

82
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.870
You can compare that to English I love versus I am loved where I am loved as a

83
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.590
pair of phostic construction,
as was the case with nouns.

84
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:48.940
We can consider all the various forms of a verb taking into account all of the

85
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:53.110
properties that those forms reflect.
And in doing so,
we conjugate the verb.

86
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.440
We can list all of the verbs,
various forms in a charter,

87
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.690
pick out a specific form based on the properties that we discussed.

88
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.640
That's called a conjugation.

89
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.000
I hope you're now comfortable with some of the basic terms that are used for

90
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:11.080
discussing the grammar verbs.
Next time we learn the basics of pronouns.
