1
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.800
Personal subject pronouns.
Those pronouns,

2
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.803
which can be said

3
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.590
Vulgar Latin and romance languages also use pronouns for a person impacted by

4
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.610
the action English.

5
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
These are object pronouns with verbs.

6
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.060
These typically sit immediately to the left of the verb in romance.

7
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.100
Bj's,
you seen maybe dates.
You see me

8
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.280
when an action impact someone directly,

9
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.110
a Latin accuser pronoun bike may or Dang,

10
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.560
he's placed before the verb,
maybe that

11
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.363
<v 0>Davy dead,</v>

12
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.450
<v 3>the first and second person,
plural.
Objects are null and void.</v>

13
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.120
<v 4>Third person objects come from the accuser tubes of Ila and Ila Lov days.</v>

14
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.460
You lovey this,

15
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.630
he loves be days
plural.

16
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.600
Them derives from the nominative elite,

17
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.240
an elite in eastern romance.

18
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.950
Italian livedo live here though

19
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.100
verbs

20
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 5>that impact their object indirectly like to me in says to me,</v>

21
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.920
have an indirect object pronouns to the left.

22
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.320
In modern romance,
these are mostly identical to the direct object pronouns.

23
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.750
Maybe see
me,
Dj and so on.

24
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.380
The difference does become apparent in the third person.

25
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.210
We're data forms are used.

26
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.530
Instead dative case elite to him or to her

27
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.863
led cove

28
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.430
<v 4>or dative Ilise to them at least [inaudible]</v>

29
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.580
vulgar Latin actually used the date of forms and other persons for indirect

30
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.760
objects,
a difference that still survives in Romanian,

31
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.800
maybe debt [inaudible] with a direct object Midi Kit mz che with an indirect

32
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:03.864
object.

33
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.010
When a verb can take both direct and indirect object pronouns,

34
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.890
they both still fall to the left of the verb.

35
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.840
Dk says,
Midi Kit says to me,

36
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.280
Lou di Kit says it.
Mulu decayed,

37
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.630
says it to me.

38
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.470
or.gives d.

39
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.210
Dot gives you lost.

40
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.340
That gives them the loss that gives them to you.

41
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.900
These object pronouns often trail non finite forums,

42
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.520
particularly infinitives dkt Lou to say it to you,

43
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.210
Spanish the teeth,
Italian Dda Tello,

44
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.320
but notice that French and Romanian keep them on the left

45
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.220
when a verb has the same subject and object.
It's called reflexive,

46
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.910
reflexive objects in English have an ending self like I see myself.

47
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.610
Romance languages use the same pronouns that you've learned as reflexives.
Vivid.

48
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.703
Yeah,

49
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.950
Devi this.
This is considered reflexive.

50
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.470
The exception is again,

51
00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:47.760
in the third person where say means herself himself,

52
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.690
itself or themselves.
[inaudible]

53
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.290
so much for object pronouns,
with verbs,
prepositions,

54
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.320
small particles that relate time or space like under or two or beside are

55
00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:20.050
followed by a different set of pronouns.

56
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.470
These are stressed and mostly resemble the subject pronouns I'd knows to us.

57
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.720
I did a lot to her,

58
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.300
<v 3>but me and you are different.
Amit,</v>

59
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.010
Amit,
Amit,
Lamina or

60
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.783
<v 6>d</v>

61
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.750
<v 3>romance.
Personal pronouns can be objects of verbs and a preposition.</v>

62
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.440
Now you have a taste of how they do that.

63
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.670
<v 7>Yeah.</v>
