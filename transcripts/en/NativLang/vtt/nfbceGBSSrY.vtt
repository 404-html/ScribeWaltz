00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.160
The U S is 50th state and one of the most popular tropical vacation destinations

2
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.860
in the world.
But how do you say its name?

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.380
Almost all the local town in street names are written in an alphabet of only get

4
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:26.910
this 13 letters.
Most of them will be a cinch for you.

5
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
Ah,
a e O Ooh.
Hey Gay la,

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.870
move new be VA,
Okinawa.

7
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.100
So that makes it easy.
Avi.

8
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.540
But this little swishy at the end is actually a letter.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.040
The same sound that hides in the middle of a up.
Oh,
okay.

10
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.360
So it's heavy.
I'll go try that one out.

11
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.300
Turns out that wasn't quite right as I'm learning from these islands.

12
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
This gets said more like I not so much.

13
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.110
I should have known it was too easy the first time.
Here we go,

14
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.540
Hawaii.
When you say it that way you at least get the,
hey,

15
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.440
that's not too bad reaction.
All right.
Practice time.

16
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.290
So I've learned that if you go snorkeling in Hawaii,

17
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:23.010
you might spot Akikiki and if you bring your underwater camera,

18
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:27.810
did this spot in Kailua Kona,
you can snap plenty of picks of the state fish,

19
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:32.811
the [inaudible] Oh and this breathtaking hike 10 miles east of Honolulu will

20
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:38.040
take you straight up an old railroad track to the top of Koko head,

21
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.480
and if we pan over here a bit there,
there we go.

22
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.060
You can catch a glimpse of the suburb below,

23
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.750
which gets called Hawaii Kai Hawaii.

24
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.270
Wait,
wasn't that Hawaii?
Hold it.
Which is it wa or VA?

25
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.110
After checking back in on the local pronunciation again,

26
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.400
it turns out that it's Hawaii or of Hawaii,

27
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.060
this kind of behavior,
once they're earned the nickname,
the vexing Hawaiian way,

28
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.010
it's a choice,
but you guys know about choices.
Maybe the tomato,

29
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:14.880
tomato situation comes to mind.
There's even a name for this.

30
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:19.050
It's called free variation.
You say tomato,

31
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.710
I say tomato,
he says Hawaii.
She says Hawaii.

32
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.820
I guess it's just personal preference,
not so fast.

33
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.970
Back in 1958 in his paper,

34
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.990
social influences on the choice of a linguistic variant.

35
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.410
John Fisher tells us that free variation is is just a convenient term we use for

36
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.901
a bunch of under the radar influences on our pronunciation influences like the

37
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:49.770
way other females or other males say something when we're learning a language is

38
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.830
children which could be going on here too.

39
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.380
I also noticed that on the radio here when the DJ speaking faster,

40
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.580
Hawaii gets cut even shorter,

41
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.000
but it's not all Pau Hana yet.

42
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.800
The music of the islands has one more on offer for us in a study on the

43
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.760
different ways Hawaiian gets pronounced when people speak it versus when they

44
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:20.020
sing it.
Joseph Kill had Donaghy of Uah Hilo documents,

45
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:25.021
places where a famous musician actually splits the word and to singing Hawaii.

46
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.520
When belting a two
have you been keeping track so far?

47
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.360
You came to me with Hawaii and now I've found you have IEE and Hawaii,

48
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.100
[inaudible] and Hawaii and even hall.
Why e?

49
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.750
Okay.
Things got a little out of hand here.

50
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.860
That's a lot of answers to what started out as a simple question,

51
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.010
but whatever you call this island chain,

52
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.980
Mahalo for taking the time to learn with me.
