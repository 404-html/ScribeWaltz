Welcome back to Youtube Space New York.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.430
I'm Jessica from comp Tom and I'm here on native laying talking about the

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.430
amazing intersection between language and code.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.730
You should be excited because we're talking about passwords today and what your

5
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:14.840
password probably isn't as good as you think it is.
Okay,
right.

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
I love cookies,
but while they make the world's best dessert,

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.870
my apps keep rejecting chocolate chip is my password.
I will show you who's weak.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
So I have to capitalize a letter at a number and maybe throw in some geometric

9
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.790
shapes and secret illuminati symbols.
Finally,

10
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.480
an acceptable password can.
I am never going to remember it.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.060
So why the Internet's gives me the run around.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.350
How exactly did password stop being?
Well,
words.

13
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.120
Welcome to comp chump.

14
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:55.121
The only show on the Internet where secrets in ye olden days,

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.920
the passwords worked a little differently.

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.180
You would walk up to that creepy I slit thingy and the people behind there would

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.810
slide it open and you had one shot to say the magic word,

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.230
but now you can just sit there spamming that paper with words.

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.220
You can throw unpronounceable nonwords at him and you could even knock on that

20
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:18.110
door from anywhere in the entire world because that Iceland is an innocent input

21
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.820
box and the people behind it is a computer and to computers.

22
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.700
Words are nothing special.
They're just boring old strings.

23
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.990
Character is appearing one after another after another after you get it.

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.330
So this is a valid string,
but so is this,
and even this,

25
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:38.720
which is an empty string,
there are so many possibilities,

26
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.830
but you know who doesn't actually see a string full of possibilities here the

27
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.670
humans like you and maybe me,

28
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.720
we fall back on our intuitive natural language to come up with strings that mean

29
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.850
something to us because we'd like to remember our passwords and if we're lucky

30
00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:00.530
we might get super clever and like SWAPA letter for a number.

31
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.030
Behold my brilliance,
I took that three and used it as an e.

32
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.820
But you know what?
More often than not,

33
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.690
you are exactly as clever as the next guy and you're busy patting yourself on

34
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.820
the back for that.
Don't believe me,

35
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.850
just look at this list of most common passwords.

36
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.090
If you're a one of the the spies who used trust,

37
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.250
no one that's got to hurt.

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.950
Kind of felt like you came up with that one all on your own.

39
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.660
Did an it all is not lost.
If your password is on that list,
you can fix it.

40
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.430
It is time for you to do what programmers call getting entropy.
No,

41
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.240
get your mind out of the gutter that is computer speak for being less

42
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:43.241
predictable and how do you become less predictable by these random random,

43
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.800
you know what?
Maybe the next time you snooze your alarm and you wake up late,

44
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.380
you should just tell your boss you were trying to get some entropy.

45
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.750
Probably won't work and you might get fired,

46
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:57.410
but at least we'll all have a good laugh and the reason that you needed that

47
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:02.350
entropy is because hackers are getting better and better at predicting even

48
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:04.360
things that seem totally unpredictable.

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.810
You are can't keep hiding behind those little dots in asterisks.

50
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.410
I have so much trouble saying the word asterisks.
Trust.

51
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.250
No one tried to outwit them with a clever spelling and a complex character,

52
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.300
but why not just make your password longer in password cracking tests done by

53
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.860
one senior security consultant,

54
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.070
an eight character password took eight days to crack.

55
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.640
Adding just one extra character bumped that time up to 750 days and 11

56
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:35.881
characters that might take you get this 17,000 years.

57
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.800
Yeah,
that makes your bank account a little safer.

58
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.310
It's a long time for someone to try to get the dollar 50 that's left in my bank

59
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.144
account.

60
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.830
The thing is is that it might take 17,000 years because predicting is actually

61
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.510
about probability.
Look,

62
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:53.020
a hacker could randomly decide to start by guessing trust note too,

63
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.910
but they're going to go with that list of shame.

64
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.210
That includes trust no one and they're going to crack trust.

65
00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.830
No one before trust note too,

66
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.840
even if it's just like right before because you know that the next sucker who's

67
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.870
password is getting hacked is trust.
No To linkedin funny characters.

68
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.560
They aren't the only things that make something guessable.
Take a look at this.

69
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.840
It's a nice random hard to guest string,
right?
Totally.

70
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.310
Totally not.
There is a pattern here.
Can you guess it?
Can you guess it?

71
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.360
Stop trying to guess with your eyes and guest with the eyes of your fingers

72
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.860
instead to de.
This is not the interview that you were looking for,

73
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.230
so I know how much it hurts to have to change your password every 90 days.

74
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.580
You can't reuse a previous password.
You can't use real words while blah,
blah,

75
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:42.190
blah.
I definitely feel it too,

76
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.160
but there is a good reason why passwords aren't real words anymore.

77
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.240
It's not because your computer hates English or because the programmer that made

78
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.000
that program really likes to give you the run around and make you play the

79
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.900
password recovery game every 90 days.
It's because words are predictable.
