1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.770
Montezuma ran a vibrant empire from one of the world's largest cities with an

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.890
amazing headdress.
But unlike his mind,
neighbors,

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:10.860
he didn't leave us books and monuments full of sentences,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580
and yet we know the Aztecs called him.
Wait,

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.210
[inaudible] not emperor that he didn't call chocolate chocolate and that

6
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.680
Montezuma is not how he said his name.
No,
no,
that's not it either.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.290
After college I went through linguistics withdrawal,

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.720
so I tore through any language you book.
I could,

9
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.990
including empires of the word right away,

10
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.590
there's this epic encounter between Spanish can,

11
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.550
keystone doors and the Aztec Emperor.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.810
But if we see a people inevitably about to be wiped from history,

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.860
this book sought to high cultures meeting across the great divide,

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.390
each telling their own story in their own words.
I lowered the book,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.230
their own words.
We know how Montezuma spoke.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.450
It turns out we do partly because while some brought swords to the new world,

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.060
others reached for pens and informants.

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.830
They wrote histories and dictionaries and rough grammars with helpful tips about

19
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:11.550
Aztec.
Well,
the Mexican language.
Now what tips,

20
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:16.080
like when you see two consonants in a row,
pronounce both.
A house was cuddly,

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.000
not guy you like.
If this were Spanish tips,
like there are only four vowels,

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.400
a e Oh,
so if you spot an Ooh,
it's really just an Owen disguise.

23
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.550
The word for flour is [inaudible] valves can be long to Ah,

24
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
a e.
Oh,
a flower isn't just churches,
it's short cheat.

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.470
Spelling is clunky,
but it works.

26
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.580
If we see it as Spanish letters layered over simple Aztec sets,

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.590
SAS say,
see Soca Cozza say Si.

28
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.240
So linguists would have done a better job,

29
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:56.241
but bygones above all the old Grammer's show off the structure of not what nouns

30
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:02.060
attach.
Affixes Oh,
do they ever non [inaudible] [inaudible]

31
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.453
[inaudible] [inaudible]

32
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.710
[inaudible] [inaudible] Nancy ne verbs.
Use Incorporation,

33
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.670
jamming things we'd call different words into a single verby body.

34
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.560
Nicola [inaudible] meet [inaudible].

35
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.840
The grammar only gets more fun from there,

36
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.590
but there's a lot these premodern grammars don't tell us.

37
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.160
Take a concrete example and important one chocolate.

38
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.360
We suspect it must've come from,
she'll call lot bitter water,

39
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.320
but there's no trace of that in the early literature,
in classical times.

40
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:41.970
The base word for the bean and the drink was [inaudible] to sort out all these

41
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:43.500
missing words and sounds.

42
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.150
Let's look into Montezuma's future and his past Montezuma's,

43
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.700
Aztecs also had books are mostly,

44
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.960
I was always told I emotionally we're full of pictographs.
Not Real writing,

45
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.320
but experts or taking a second look spelled the word,

46
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.460
see what woman as you like.

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.610
Here's how one glyphs does with two bars.

48
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.590
The bars stand for the syllable Wa compare that to the way colonial writers

49
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:13.480
spelled the sound war.
I walk,
cut way Eggy and we'll see.

50
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:17.020
Wow.
So this isn't a val,
Ooh,

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.800
it's an h plus you representing the consonant.
Woo.

52
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.170
But our best evidence comes from modern mouths.
Yup.
People still speak.

53
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:31.171
Now what they may call it mass say wildly meaning commoner or even just Mexican,

54
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.340
but they help pin down it's sounds.

55
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.700
Those uhs do indeed correspond to was there really are just four vowels and this

56
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:41.830
fourth valgus freely between Owen.
Ooh.

57
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.890
Which explains those earlier spelling variations.

58
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.980
And elephant in the room or Jaguar in the temple,

59
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.600
but this TLL over the place is car.

60
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.380
You'll even hear two k sounds as in skull,

61
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.190
godly plus a tricky made by rounding your lips,

62
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.210
Cla Creek.

63
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.080
This sound can even end a syllable day.

64
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.960
The spelling here is awkward and inconsistent.
Today I'm going with this one,

65
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.460
tie all this pronunciation analysis together and we can dig up a glimpse of what

66
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:20.230
Montezuma's named sounded like in his day.
Motech Soma,

67
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.260
Motech Soma,
but out of respect,

68
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:27.430
you might want to add the polites suffix motech so Maxine,

69
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.923
did you hear that?

70
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.050
Seen not seen certain consonants were voiceless at the end of a syllable.

71
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.740
Try this one.

72
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.770
NOCCA cow with a voiced will in the middle and a voiceless w at the end,

73
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.300
ELLs are particularly noticeable.

74
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.760
They're not [inaudible] but as pet,

75
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.150
but there were still too many unknowns.
Remember your favorite sound?

76
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.340
We'll some speakers ditch it.

77
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.640
They say no what or now on who's right or take this h before consonant colonial

78
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.410
texts in precisely called it a salad.
PGO A skip.
Come on.

79
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.550
The IPA wasn't even invented yet.
Today.
Most people say Ms Chic,

80
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.660
a few same issue.
Which ones older?

81
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.240
Zoom out from now,
what to see its siblings,
cousins,
parents,
grandparents.

82
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.520
Carefully comparing them for patterns.

83
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:25.690
Linguist proved they're part of a Youdo as tech and family that stretches from

84
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.110
Central America up to the western US linguists,

85
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.190
including this guy wharf place.
Now within that history,

86
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.200
warf worked out that an early tea sound change into,
oh,

87
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.120
so now what is older?

88
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.750
Wait later linguist showed this change applied to the entire now one branch.

89
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.560
Now what?
And Noah were the innovations.
So keep practicing your,

90
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.060
that Pesky San Diego that sound you lop off words when you borrow them,

91
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.030
even if it's the Aztec name for themselves.
That was even more elusive,

92
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.160
but hard work showed a syllable final stop like a k or a t turning into a catch

93
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.830
in your throat before becoming the popular sound.

94
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.250
In the old days they said,
ms she cut slot,

95
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.950
totally plot.

96
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.190
Oh and they stressed the second to last syllable.

97
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.040
We got way you eat lots.

98
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.460
Swanee so Aztec had a family.

99
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.270
It also had neighbors,

100
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.080
unrelated mezo American neighbors that all shared the same features,

101
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.400
including a special ritual language as tech ritual.

102
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:39.660
Speech was unlike the Common Masay,
wildly speech elite schools,

103
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.870
cosmic huck taught noble children the old ways in where with laboratory.

104
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.030
So if you've been paying attention,
you know that church,

105
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.360
it means flower and quick.
That means song.
Well,

106
00:06:51.361 --> 00:06:56.361
you still need ancient parallelisms to grasp the Nobel phrase [inaudible] in

107
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.240
Oak,
we call a stylish way to say my poem.

108
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.310
This is the same ritual language from my tale of the fall of the empire in

109
00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:09.450
Matson in motor bed scene,
just to say your city,

110
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.670
he was at the crossroads of an ancient language when that wasn't just about

111
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:17.790
articulating.
Now what sounds are building intricate words,

112
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.530
but making your speech ring with poetry like a real emperor.
I mean,

113
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.540
wait,
Latwonda stick around and subscribe for language.
