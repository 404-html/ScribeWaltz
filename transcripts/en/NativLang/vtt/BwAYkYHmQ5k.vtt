1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.800
A band of lost vikings,

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:06.510
had self for some good pillaging converts to Islam and teaches us all we need to

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:08.220
know about the secrets of the rooms.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.970
You heard that right today.

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.400
It's all the runes you can handle first,

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.860
learn what rooms are and how the north used them.

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.580
Then watch the endless not to explore the history of the word rune and some

8
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.520
surprising ways runes are still relevant to our own tongue.

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.470
It's a double dose of runic content onto our story.
Spain,

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.910
the early Middle Ages,

11
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.780
the right kind of time and place for the Muslim conquest to drive out the ruling

12
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.070
goths and then for the new ruler to turn around and declare Spain his own

13
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:38.904
emirate.

14
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.720
But it's also the right kind of time in place for some marauding vikings here,

15
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.620
the come sailing down the coast around eight 40.
And what a vikings do,

16
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.630
give me some words.
They uh,
they raid,
they pillage,
they uh,

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.250
they sack.
Yes.
The Norseman sacked Lisbon and then sealed up to savvy.

18
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.880
Yet in eight 44 they attacked,
they start of panic,

19
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.660
and then they held out for weeks waiting for the ransom gold.
When it did arrive,

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.310
surprise,
it wasn't gold.

21
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:09.810
It was a Muslim army ready to crush the vikings and burn their ships.
Try again.

22
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
Wait some decades re invade Seville and get slaughtered by more and delusion

23
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.190
forces.
Now,
only ones Raven's know what happens next.

24
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.220
But the story goes that a small band of vikings escaped,

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
wandered around and settled in southern Spain where they converted to Islam and

26
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.270
became the region's first cheese makers.

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.650
The vikings themselves aren't the ones telling us this tail.
No.

28
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
We get tales of Viking raids from their victims who wrote in bookish scripts

29
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.870
like Arabic and Latin in Arabic.
They didn't even know what to call them.

30
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.900
So Vikings where Magis Madeye Zoroastrians the Magis weren't just pillaging

31
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.520
Spain.
They had in England and Scotland 50 years earlier,

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.710
they stormed Normandy and Paris.

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.550
They sacked Ligurian piza founded Bruce in the east.

34
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.420
So there even to think for Russia and Ukraine,
they threatened Constantinople,

35
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.920
were hired to guard Constantinople and let this graffiti in the eye.
Yes,
Sophia,

36
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
they even took a Greek holiday to etch rooms into the purees lion near Athens.

37
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.640
Now hold your tiers,

38
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.660
but the loss Viking cheesemakers might just be a legend based on an

39
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.060
interpretation based on an Arabic text.

40
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.430
But that brings up a bigger linguistic question.

41
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.820
Why do we run to Arabic and Latin for our Viking history?

42
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.700
The Norse not know how to write,

43
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.890
meet the rooms.
This is the elder fouth arc.

44
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.940
It's the oldest form of the runes and it works like a full on alphabet.

45
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.300
It's not the ABC's though.
It's a faith arc.
Ooh.

46
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.160
Or these straight line letters.

47
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:51.300
Perfect for wood and stone are hundreds of years older than the vikings though.

48
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.870
It's hard to say where they come from.
They look a telic,

49
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.380
but what kind of metallic Latin?
Some other old Italk Alphabet,

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.920
but the evolved to write early Germanic languages like pro Norse artifacts in

51
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.070
the elder fouth arc are rare,
mostly Scandinavian and all shorts.

52
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.540
Often very short.
This comb is our oldest says Hadiya.

53
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.690
That doesn't mean hair.
That would be funny,

54
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.430
but it's probably a personal name,
personal names,
time after time.

55
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.431
These things say this is my name and I made this like on these Danish golden

56
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.090
horns from the fifth century,

57
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.960
I can lay walk us these whole DOJ made this horn.

58
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.230
But these rooms weren't all about passing information.

59
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.530
Runes offered protection magic words like d was the God too and Tuesday low

60
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.420
cause for garlic and all over the place.
All the Ale.

61
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.410
Oh and in this ale you can see other writing direction wasn't even always left

62
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.244
to right.

63
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.490
So runes had power or in the words of this rune stone master of ruins.

64
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.401
I hide here,

65
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:02.170
runes of power forever plagued by evil deeds and doomed to insidious death.

66
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.570
Whoever breaks this,
I like it.

67
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.520
Those still aren't Viking rooms.
These are Viking runes.

68
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.110
The faith thought took this shape just a bit before the sacking and pillaging at

69
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.280
the beginning of our story.

70
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.960
This is called the younger fouth arc and it was a big change spot.

71
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:24.280
The difference at a time with Latin was busy adding letters.
The Norse.

72
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.460
We're actually going backwards in a way.
Cutting letters out.

73
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.790
They got rid of the and go even though they were still pronouncing them now both

74
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.150
to and Kinda had to do double duty.
This happened with a number of letters,

75
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.990
consonants and vowels.
By the way,
these magical runes,
they all have fancy,

76
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.470
dramatic names.
The younger faith arc was short on letters,

77
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:49.340
but not on scriptions.
Today we only have hundreds of inscriptions in the elder.

78
00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:53.110
Faith are compared to thousands upon thousands in the younger faith arc,

79
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.080
mostly rune stones honoring dead men.

80
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.910
The language of these imposing stones is old Norse and it's already very

81
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.480
different from that proto Norstrom earlier,
younger.
If we thought rune stones,

82
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:08.950
give us a second look at those ominous seafaring Raiders so despised and feared

83
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.140
by the book.
Any crowd go knee,

84
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.350
raise this stone in memory of or Albany is good son.

85
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.850
He died on the western route or all been involved or had the rooms carved.

86
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.020
He was in Greece.

87
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.850
It was commander of the retinue got raised this stone in memory of Olay fit.

88
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.740
He plowed a stern to the east and met his end in Italy via fostered.

89
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.010
Had this stone raised up in memory of goof moon,
but his brother,

90
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.580
he died in the Abassid caliphate.
May God help his spirit.

91
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.000
Then the end of the Viking age,

92
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.440
Pagan Scandinavia was Christianized,
but were they done with runes?

93
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.640
Not right away.

94
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.660
When King Huddle Bluetooth told the world how we converted the Danes.

95
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.310
He used a rune stone.

96
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.020
Sweden has the greatest concentration of rune stones and many of them are late

97
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.930
and explicitly Christian,
but then watch out.
They're still Thor's hammer.

98
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.180
The Latin alphabet took over and the 11 hundreds when the Norse fully joined the

99
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.380
book and eat club and wrote down their ed does and Sagas but interest in the

100
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:10.250
runes lingered.

101
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.510
They made a medieval comeback in Codex Rukus for writing Nordic laws.

102
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.960
They even survived in a pocket of Sweden as the Dalit Carlene runes into the 18

103
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.680
hundreds the old runes were terse.
They were short on words,

104
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.290
but rich with names.
They meant kinship,

105
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.800
protection and remembrance to the people that didn't see writing as the

106
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:33.080
mellifluous prose of Arabic and Latin.

107
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.770
Well at least to the ones that didn't convert to a book and he culture and start

108
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.640
making cheese.

109
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.870
But the Norse weren't the only rune masters around in the first millennium.

110
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.860
Come watch the endless not to explore the etymological twists and turns taken by

111
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:49.640
rooms and the word ruin itself in the history of English.

112
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.730
Stick around and subscribe for language.
