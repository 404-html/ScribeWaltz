<v 0>Hello and welcome to the second part in native lane.com this course on how to</v>

3
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:18.321
use the Ip to learn about pronunciation in language like vows.

4
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.950
When we talk about consonants in the context of phonetics,
in the APA,

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.660
we don't tend to say the letter B or the consonant B.
Instead,

6
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.590
we distinguish features,
the building blocks that make up consonants.

7
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.180
For starters,
we'll consider three basic features of consonants.

8
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.330
First,
where in your mouth do you make this constant sound?
In other words,

9
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.000
where's the consonant sound coming from in your mouth?

10
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.690
The linguistic term for that is place of articulation.

11
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.360
You articulate the sound somewhere,
so that's the place of articulation.

12
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.620
There are multiple places of articulation that helps us distinguish where the

13
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.120
sound is coming from.
If it involves both of your lips,

14
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.710
like the sound p,

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.020
that's going to be a bilabial sound by laypeople,
meaning both lips.

16
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.770
If it involves your tongue against your upper teeth,

17
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.950
that's going to be a dental sound like fun.

18
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.130
If you place your tongue against the back of the gum ridge above your upper

19
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:27.900
teeth,
that's an alveolar sound like s.

20
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.190
If you run your tongue up from your gum ridge for their back towards your

21
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.024
Palette,

22
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.800
you can make a post alveolar sound like shut and that eventually you'll get to

23
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
your palate,
the roof of your mouth that produces a palatal sound like,

24
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.390
yeah.
Further back in your mouth,

25
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:50.391
you have your Villum that produces a Vilar sound like k inside your throat.

26
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.710
You have a Gladys,

27
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.630
and that produces a glottal sound like the catching your throat in.
Uh,

28
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.830
uh,
we've skipped some places of articulation,

29
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.780
but that's a good start.
That covers where you print out sounds,

30
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:08.850
but what about how you pronounce them?

31
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.790
That's called the manner of articulation.

32
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.740
If you force air up through your nose,
that's a nasal sound.

33
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.590
So you can put your tongue against your gum ridge,

34
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.490
but force the air up through your nose,
which produces the sound.

35
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.550
And you could momentarily stop the airflow to make a stop or a plosive.

36
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.510
So the sound k is a Vilar sound.

37
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.700
It involves the back of your mouth.

38
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.660
That's its place of articulation and the stopping of air,

39
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:43.290
which makes it a plosive.
That's its manner of articulation.

40
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Another type of sound is a fricative from Latin meaning to rub that involves the

41
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:55.251
kind of continuous restricted hissing airflow between your tongue and wherever

42
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.550
you're producing the sound.

43
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.420
Or in the case of the Bilabial fricative between your two lists.

44
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.323
<v 2>Oops.</v>

45
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 0>So if you close your lips and you produce a fricative sound by letting the air</v>

46
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.170
his through,
you get a Japanese f sound.

47
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.110
If you move your tongue up to your alveolar ridge where you made that nasal

48
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.220
sound [inaudible] and instead let the air continue to pass through your tongue

49
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.130
and gum ridge,
you get the z sound.

50
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.900
Another type or manner of articulation is the approximate,

51
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.560
which includes the glides year and Wa in English.

52
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.300
So there are more manners of articulation just like there were more places of

53
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.890
articulation.
The third feature to distinguish here is voicing,

54
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.240
which involves letting the vocal cords in your voicebox vibrate together,

55
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.080
opening and closing them really fast.
When you do that,

56
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.800
you actually produce a voiced sound instead of a voiceless sound.

57
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.840
Vowels are typically all voiced.
That's where they get their name from,
in fact,

58
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.030
but consonants can be voiceless.

59
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.530
The classic tests to tell a difference between voiced sounds and voiceless

60
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.500
sounds is to put your fingers against your throat.

61
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.730
You'll feel that your throat vibrates whenever you save voiced sound and it

62
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.040
doesn't.
Whenever you say a voiceless sound,

63
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.120
there are sounds that have the same place of articulation and manner of

64
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:20.900
articulation,
but different voicing only.
For instance,

65
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.040
s and z are pronounced the same way,
at the same place in your mouth,

66
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.120
but is voiceless and voiced.

67
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.740
You can't see it,
but my throat's vibrating.
You can try it for yourself.

68
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.420
Just as with vowels,

69
00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:39.890
we can lay consonants out on a chart by their component features.

70
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.340
This time on the y axis will take manner of articulation on the x axis will take

71
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.110
place of articulation and the z axis will be voiced.

72
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.740
Voiceless pairs.
Since this is two dimensional,

73
00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:59.270
we'll write that as voiceless sound,
comma voiced sound.

74
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.610
For instance,
s Comma,

75
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.120
z in the same place and manner of articulation.

76
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.760
I'll read some basic consonant sounds off to you in this chart so you can hear

77
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:14.210
them and associate them with the Individual Ipa symbols.

78
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.080
<v 4>Mm mm,
mm.</v>

79
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.400
But to the,

80
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.030
are you well,

81
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.430
<v 3>okay.</v>
