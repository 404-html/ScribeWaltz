MMM.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.750
<v 1>Hi.
This video is for anyone interested in syntax,</v>

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.840
especially anyone who's still interested in syntax.

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.230
After going through my introduction to the grammar of sentences series,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.160
I'd like to present a short overview of computational grammars and generative

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.480
syntax.
I'll spend some time exploring what simple sentences tell us about human

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:25.314
language grammar.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
I'll take a look at the now classic parse tree or x Bar model that attempts to

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.000
capture what humans are doing when we speak a language and put sentences

10
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.930
together and I'll conclude by mentioning a few other models of human grammar.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.840
The terms language and grammar get thrown around a lot and it would take me well

12
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.420
beyond my time here to work out a sturdy definition with you.

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.220
I'll merely point you in a single direction narrowing language down to natural

14
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:51.001
human language,

15
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:55.140
which is an umbrella term for the specific first language you learned as a
child,

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
your first language and whatever system or process you had available to you as a

17
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.400
child that allowed you to learn that language.
At this point,

18
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:05.280
the notion of grammar becomes relevant under one approach.

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.030
The grammar is something you have in your mind that gets configured in a certain

20
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:09.241
way.

21
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:12.990
Allowing you to use a language under another approach of grammar is something

22
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.110
you puzzle out of a language as you learn it.
In either case,

23
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:21.111
notice that grammar is not as set of literary stylistic or social preferences

24
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:24.180
like don't say eight eight,
eight a word.
Instead,

25
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.750
the linguistic understanding of grammar seeks out the fundamental mechanism for

26
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:28.740
sentence production.

27
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.480
The common way to conceive of this grammar of natural languages too grounded in

28
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:37.830
the speech of real speakers and to explain it as a series of rules.

29
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.320
Let's clarify rule here.

30
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.010
These rules or statements or imperatives that tell the system how to handle

31
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:48.510
chunks of language,
the grammar using our linguistic definition of that term,

32
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.330
take some input processes,

33
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.350
processes that input using a series of rule statements and produces or generates

34
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:57.184
some output.

35
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.340
This set up means that grammar allows certain sentences and disallows others.

36
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.330
Its ability to generate language earns this broad stroke model of grammar.

37
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.040
The title,
Generative Grammar.

38
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.170
One tool for modeling linguistic grammar is x bar theory.

39
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.840
This model parses the grammar of sentences.

40
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.870
By looking for the relationships between word classes,

41
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.840
determining how to group these words into phrases,

42
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.430
working out the keyword or head word of the phrase and building back until we

43
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.970
can view the grammar of a whole sentence as a single expanded tree.

44
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.530
Here's a simple tree for the sentence.
The boss ate soup.

45
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.030
The major nodes on this tree are phrases.
Each phrase has a head,
for example,

46
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:40.740
the head of a verb,
phrases,
a verb.

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.670
The other elements in a phrase are either specifiers are complements.

48
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.210
Specifiers are sisters of the sub phrases within a phrase,

49
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.770
meaning that they branch off from the main phrase here and sit parallel with any

50
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.620
sub phrase below the main phrase.
Comments.

51
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.990
Compliments are sisters of the head,

52
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.290
so they branch out next to the head word like happy and from Rome.

53
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.180
If we added happy boss from Rome,

54
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.870
the specifiers still stays up here on the branch.

55
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.220
The first branch of the Noun phrase specifiers and complements our relative and

56
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.910
found throughout the tree.
Just like heads the subject of the sentence.

57
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.500
This noun phrase here is the specifier of this sentence.
Node together,

58
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:24.940
the head and the specifiers and complements make up all the material in a
phrase.

59
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.020
The tree still relies on terms for word classes,

60
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.820
which traditional grammarians called parts of speech like Noun for preposition

61
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:34.660
or determiner.

62
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.910
What if I want to add a prepositional phrase like at home to the sentence while

63
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.510
we have to expand the nodes and our verb phrase instead of just the no down here

64
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.590
for the verb and the noun phrase over here,
we need a prepositional phrase,

65
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.410
but this structure,
verb,
Noun,

66
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.170
phrase preposition was phrase starts to flatten out our tree.

67
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.380
When we start asserting the syntactic structure of a language of,

68
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.840
of a chunk of language like this,

69
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.530
it makes sense to figure out if the arrangements were choosing have linguistic

70
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:03.364
support.

71
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.310
Do we have any reason to maintain this flat structure or on the contrary,

72
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.960
we have any rationale for adding some depth to this word phrase

73
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.090
considered two pieces of natural language data as evidence.

74
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.520
The boss ate soup at home,
the boss ate at home soup.

75
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.680
The second sentence doesn't work because the propositional phrase material falls

76
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:31.530
too close to the verb.
It seems like that the verb expects the core arguments.

77
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:35.620
Soup to follow.
Core arguments seem to fall adjacent to the verb.

78
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.190
For more about core arguments,
see my video on the Bourbon.
It's arguments.

79
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.930
I'll leave a link below before we solve this flat,
this problem in our our tree.

80
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:47.560
Let me just take a quick sidetrack into the issue of linguistic evidence.

81
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.780
Ideally,
any grammar we're proposing,

82
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.830
especially any grammar that we claim models how humans produce language or at

83
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:57.850
least how computers can produce human language must account for the kinds of

84
00:04:57.851 --> 00:04:59.470
sentences it models.

85
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.090
Evidence includes sentences that impact the claim that our grammar works and

86
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:07.990
this evidence can be positive because it's a well formed natural language

87
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:11.770
sentence or nay negative because of speaker of a natural language would judge it

88
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.663
as unfit,

89
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.360
negative evidence like the sentence the boss ate soup at home is marked with an

90
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.270
asterisk by convention
back to our tree.

91
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.350
Let's account for the ordering of Verb Noun phrase,

92
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.590
prepositional phrase by prioritizing their distance from the head.

93
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:34.360
Verb eight we had some intermediate nodes below the v,
the verb,

94
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.800
some v Bar nodes that allow us to expand adjacent phrases.

95
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.120
Now we can see that the noun phrase sits closer to the verb and the

96
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.660
propositional phrase appears at a distance from the verb.

97
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.370
We've modeled a complete sentence.

98
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:51.490
Now let's pull back and make some general observations.

99
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:56.170
Then works through some useful terminology for moving around this tree.
First,

100
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.610
notice that we have kinds of phrases.
Noun,

101
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.670
phrase for a prepositional phrase for phrase,

102
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.390
but they all behave in the same way containing some head noun,

103
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:09.080
verb or preposition and expanding out either to the left or the right.

104
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.030
We can abstract this concept and say that all of our phrases take the form x

105
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.180
phrase where x stands for some head word class.

106
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.560
Since the x rays expands to some node x Bar,

107
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.020
the whole model takes name x box theory.

108
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.610
What about our top node s while there's a mismatch between all of our expanding

109
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.670
x phrase nodes here which have the form of some x and P and this top branching

110
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:37.340
node which isn't named some x phrase,

111
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.360
think of of more appropriate name like inflectional phrase.

112
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.130
Of course it follows that the head of this inflectional phrases some eye,

113
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.620
the inflection may be pulled out as tense in agreement information because it's

114
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.820
a finite sentence.

115
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.510
We can even expand beyond this individual sentence here to a CP compliment as a

116
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.450
phrase with somewhere that that connects it to even larger chunks of language.

117
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.240
At this point we we've made a parse tree that we can walk starting at the top

118
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.210
node.
This node dominates all the nodes below it.

119
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.200
The nodes below each dominate the nodes below them.

120
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.090
In all cases,

121
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.440
notice that each note in our tree dominates at most two other nodes.

122
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.550
We've followed the binary branching hypothesis which maintains this kind of

123
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:27.380
structure to give our sentences depth,

124
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.410
flexibility and according to proponents grammar,

125
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.060
grammatical accuracy nodes falling to the left of other nodes on the same level,

126
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:38.990
proceed nodes to the right.
This precedence differs from dominance

127
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.430
nodes immediately dominated by a node.
See Command.

128
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:48.330
Every node dominated by that immediate dominating node.
So here V-bar,

129
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.720
see commands prepositional phrase.

130
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.570
We continue walking all of these branches of this tree to all of these branching

131
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:58.970
nodes until we get down to the bottom nodes,

132
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.830
the terminal symbols which contain the actual words and morphemes of the

133
00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:03.664
sentence.

134
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.130
There's a shorthand way to capture this whole grammar in a collection of

135
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:09.140
statements called rewrite rules.

136
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.530
We've seen that a noun phrase dominates and end bar and an end that a verb

137
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:19.760
praise expands to the bar and V or another phrase like a noun phrase or

138
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:20.870
prepositional phrase.

139
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.430
So we can take all these together and say that an ex phrase where x is your head

140
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:30.431
word can be rewritten as some why phrase some other phrase or an x bar.

141
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.970
Then an x bar can be rewritten as an x or a wife prays and that in any x,

142
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:43.040
once you get to an ax,
you're headed,
you've arrived at a terminal symbol.

143
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.540
This takes us from the top to the bottom of a tree.

144
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.250
Parse trees may help computers and people resolve the kinds of ambiguities that

145
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.630
thrive in natural language.

146
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.120
You're are already aware that sentences can be ambiguous.

147
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.240
Somebody has certainly told you something that could be interpreted in different

148
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.930
ways.
Ambiguity has two general scopes.

149
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.560
A sentence can have global ambiguity or local ambiguity.

150
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.120
Global ambiguity impacts the whole sentence.
As in the canonical example,

151
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.710
time flies like an arrow.

152
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.910
Local ambiguity is limited to one or more pieces of a sentence.

153
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.990
Besides scope.
There are also different types of ambiguity.

154
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.490
Structural ambiguity occurs when more than one parse tree can be used to

155
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:27.870
represent the sentence,

156
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.470
so different grammatical structures are yielding different interpretations of

157
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.430
the sentence.
Consider again the sentence,
time flies like an arrow.

158
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.640
If you haven't evaluated that phrase before,
think about it.

159
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.630
Now you can understand the sentence in multiple ways,

160
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:47.040
including with time as the verb flies as the verb or like is the verb.

161
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.460
When one of the leaves of a parse tree,

162
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:52.680
the words can be understood in multiple ways.

163
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.050
You have an example of word sense ambiguity.

164
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.610
The meaning of the word cards in she has cards in her pocket is ambiguous.

165
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.720
We know what's a noun,

166
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:05.250
but does it mean credit cards or playing cards when it's unclear what a pronoun

167
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:06.150
refers back to?

168
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:11.130
That's a case of referential ambiguity in John told Jake that he has to come to

169
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:15.480
the party.
We know that he is a pronoun,
but does it refer to John or to Jake?

170
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.980
All right.
It's time to conclude this rough survey of parse trees.

171
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.930
The topic of Grammars is deep,

172
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.530
contentious and central to questions about the structure of individual
languages,

173
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.600
the human brain's ability to acquire language,

174
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.750
computer processing of language and artificial intelligence.

175
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.820
There are many linguistic models of grammar,

176
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:34.590
including other rule based approaches,

177
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:38.400
statistical approaches based on large amounts of natural language data and

178
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:41.550
approaches that see language as the outcome of competing ranked viable

179
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:44.130
constraints instead of inviolable row rules.

180
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.410
But those are all topics for another day.

181
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.920
It's been fun to work through a simplified model with you and thanks for

182
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.520
learning with me.
