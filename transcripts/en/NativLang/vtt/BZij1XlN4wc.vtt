00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.630
Hmm.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.930
<v 1>The last lesson introduced you to clauses and gave you a brief definition of a</v>

3
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.840
sentence.
This time we move on to phrases.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.660
Phrases are basic units and sentence structure.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.550
They allow us to group words together and do broader units where each group of

6
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.780
words acts as its own unit.
Every phrase has a head word,

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.620
which is the main content word or the main function word in that phrase.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.840
So when noun phrases based around now and the now and as the head of our phrases

9
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.950
based around a head verb and a prepositional phrase around a preposition,

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.940
phrases have three parts.
The first part is the head,

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.300
the main word mentioned above.
The second part is to compliment,

12
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:51.300
which may be optional and usually occurs next to the head.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.130
It's adjacent to the head.

14
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.660
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440
<v 1>The third part is the specifier,
which qualifies the head in some way.</v>

16
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.990
Let me give you an example.
In the red car,

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.080
the word car is clearly the noun in the noun phrase,

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.290
so it's the head word of that Noun.
Phrase red,

19
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.650
which occurs right next to the noun,
modifies the noun.

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.210
It's an adjective and the word the specifies to know

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.170
a key feature of phrases is that they can embed into other phrases.

22
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.400
You'll notice that phrases will build up into other phrases which will then

23
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:31.390
build up into larger and larger phrases until we get to a sentence which is

24
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:36.310
itself an entire phrase.
So all of these are grammatically connected units.

25
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.960
Here's an English example of a phrase and betted into another phrase.

26
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.210
Prepositional phrases have a head word,
a preposition like two,

27
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.240
four under before prepositions are used with nouns and the nouns going to be

28
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:57.040
part of a noun phrase in the propositional phrase to the store.

29
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.200
I have a preposition to and I have a noun phrase the store.
I don't look at them.

30
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.860
Side by side is parallel words.
Instead I see that the noun phrase,

31
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:09.670
the store in beds into the preposition or phrase to this store,

32
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.780
and this is a key feature for building sentences with phrases.

33
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.750
When we use phrases to look at the structure of grammar,

34
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.090
this is how language is built.
Sentences,

35
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.400
how do we display this embedding hierarchical structure visually?
Well.

36
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.410
One way to do it is with brackets.

37
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.320
This is straightforward enough with simple examples like the preposition or

38
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:31.360
phrase to the store.

39
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.790
We'll put each phrase into a set of brackets so we can enclose the entire noun

40
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.130
phrase the store in brackets.

41
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.490
After that we put the entire propositional phrase to the store and its own set

42
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:49.360
of brackets and that allows us to write out the structure of phrases so that we

43
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:53.230
can analyze them and discuss this embedding syntex behind them.

44
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.840
We focused entirely on phrases,
but there's a competing model of basic sentence.

45
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.430
Instead of looking for unit chunks of language phrases,

46
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.380
we can consider how words depend on each other instead of a simple phrase.

47
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.381
Analysis of my boss ate soup begins by breaking the sentence into a subject noun

48
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:15.190
phrase,

49
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.110
my boss and a predicate verb phrase ate soup where the predicate breaks down

50
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:25.111
further into head verb and the verbs object in a dependency analysis.

51
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.680
On the other hand,
the verb has a subject and an object that depend on it.

52
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.250
No main verb,
no subject of a main verb and no object either.

53
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.990
This keeps the discussion at the level of the words and the relationship to one

54
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.710
another rather than abstracting up to larger and larger phrase units.

55
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.270
Crucially though it does not break sentences into subject,

56
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.190
the doer of the action versus predicate,
the action and everything acted upon.

57
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.850
Take the other example to the store.

58
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.600
The preposition to as a dependency that goes this way,

59
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.930
and the article depends on the noun governed by that preposition phrases or

60
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:09.100
dependencies are two ways of breaking syntax down into the smallest relationship

61
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:13.630
between words.
Once you understand them,
it's time to move on to the next lesson.
