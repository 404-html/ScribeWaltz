1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.680
Turn on the radio,
the latest hit,
rhymes,
crack open.

2
00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:06.410
That book of classical Chinese poetry sitting in your closet,

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.420
those lines rhyme inside and out.
That old Mayan Codex sitting next to it.

4
00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:16.421
Repeat similar sounding phrases in sets of two dramatic rhymes repeated a single

5
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:18.080
starting sound.

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.240
But why do humans the world over force fit words into these odd repeating

7
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.140
structures?
What's the reason and rhyme for rhymes?

8
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.770
People like rhymes even more than just plain saying what they mean.

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.250
You like rhymes,
well most of you do,

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.980
but you also find them persuasive.

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.690
Give people a claim that rhymes and a tweaked version that doesn't what happens?

12
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.200
They think that the Rhymey are one is actually truer.

13
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.960
It's one of those mental shortcuts we take.

14
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.850
Like when my ads rhyme sounds smooth,
my product is easier to choose.

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.470
Hey,
so instead of rings true.
Should we say rhymes true?

16
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.240
It doesn't stop there.
Sprichst near has a heavy foreign accent,

17
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.920
so he's hard to understand.

18
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.090
But did you know that you're also less likely to trust what he's saying?

19
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.780
Rhymes are one of those things that,
how did these researchers put it?

20
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.390
Increase processing fluency.

21
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.320
They make my words more beautiful and more trustworthy.

22
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.090
We could literally be using rhymes to figure out who we trust.

23
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.990
Pleasant,
easier to process,
trusted in groups.

24
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.310
Sounds like the essential ingredients for history's oldest works of literature.

25
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.870
The oral tradition,

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.200
which isn't just some old storyteller standing over a campfire reciting 5,000

27
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.470
line epics about mythical animals in long dead heroes.

28
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.330
It's also the jokes,

29
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.900
the sayings or the ear worms that are embedded in your memory.

30
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.380
If these guys are right,
memory is the key.

31
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.100
It even puts a time limit on how effective rhymes can be.

32
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.870
Once you start a rhyme,

33
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.050
your audience's memory buffer expects you to finish it up within three seconds.

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.810
What if our brains aren't merely timing our rhymes?

35
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.120
What if we are hard wired to rhyme,

36
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.150
but how would rhymes end up in our genes?

37
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.280
Maybe as a costly display of fitness,
which is a fancy way of saying,

38
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.320
how do I put this in polite company?

39
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.860
Rhymes were a good way of getting people in the sac.

40
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.440
These whale lovers think we're not the only ones vocalizing repetitive patterns

41
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:40.441
to catch a mate recording more than 600 whale songs over 32 years.

42
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.770
They found that the songs differ hugely between pods,

43
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.150
but that a single pod sinks a single song that changes over time,

44
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.350
almost deliberately.

45
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.060
The usual biological explanation for trendy changes goes like this,

46
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.080
Mr Wales z over there is improvising just enough to be attractive,

47
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.290
but not so much that he sounds like an outsider.

48
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.390
It's an optimal mismatch.

49
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
Do we crave this balance to a rhyming sweet spot?

50
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.350
Is that why love songs make a swoon and hip hop artists brag about their lyrical

51
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.190
skills,
or do we just like songs as much as the next?
Well,

52
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.503
after all,

53
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.510
there's even an old idea that human language rhymes and all actually came from

54
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.210
music.
Maybe we're rhythmic by nature,

55
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.830
so the next time you throw on your favorite song and start filling those lyrics,

56
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.000
think a bit more about what stands behind your love of a good rhyme.
