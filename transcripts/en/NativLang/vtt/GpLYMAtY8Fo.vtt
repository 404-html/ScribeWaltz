1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.350
Uh,

2
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.650
<v 2>verbs are among those variable words we saw in the intro to the series.</v>

3
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.100
Each verb has a stem and a range of endings.

4
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.090
We'll dig into the components of those endings at the end of this video.

5
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.480
<v 2>The feature known as person gives away the conversational distance of the actor</v>

7
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.430
from the speaker.
I am the first person.

8
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.150
You are the second person and somebody else,
he,

9
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.700
she or it is the third person.

10
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.900
Latin verbs had different endings for these three persons.

11
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Amil Hamas.
You didn't even need a pronoun with the Bourbon.

12
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.390
Latin,
just these endings.
Romance verbs the work the same way.

13
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.150
Vulgar Latin Condo,
Ganja,
much like Katelyn Cantu,

14
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.100
Qantas,
Qantas,
and Italian Canto Canada.

15
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.841
Of course,

16
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.841
you can include the subject perhaps for emphasis to Qantas to Qantas decanters,

17
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.150
decanter certain languages in or not far from France,

18
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.420
the only major one being French requiring subject,

19
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.400
but this is an innovation,

20
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.050
French [inaudible] and not just shelter for icing.

21
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.600
The modern languages.
Also developed polite second person forms.

22
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.500
Qantas addresses you informally,

23
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060
but to be polite languages like Portuguese,
Spanish and Italian.

24
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:32.170
Coopt content.

25
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.370
Other languages like French and Romanian use plural forms for the same purpose.

26
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.230
<v 3>Okay.</v>

27
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.921
<v 2>First,</v>

28
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:47.680
second and third person forms also exist in the plural moose.

29
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.570
This vulgar Latin verbs have unique endings for these two come Thomas

30
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.660
[inaudible] Canton.

31
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.243
<v 3>Okay.</v>

32
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.960
<v 2>French rematch.</v>

33
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.800
Emiliano Romaniello and a few other languages still require pronouns.

34
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.590
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

35
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.590
<v 2>Politeness matters in the plural to to address a group of people politely.</v>

36
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.700
Some languages use content.

37
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.400
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

38
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.050
<v 2>French Romich and Romanian you's the second person,
plural verb,</v>

39
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.470
to address one of you politely or a group of you in any way,

40
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.570
but the same isn't true of Spanish can Camtasia,

41
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.080
which is only an informal way of saying all of you seeing

42
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.550
bring back those nouns from last time.

43
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.010
Third person endings are the ones to use with them.
Singular with singular nouns.

44
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.690
Plurals with plural nouns,

45
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.080
so Elu Lupo content or [inaudible] content or maybe with a more fitting noun.

46
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.090
[inaudible] [inaudible]

47
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.440
verbs like I'm a contests have a content part,

48
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.800
a stem and a range of possible endings.

49
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.080
The stem doesn't stand alone.

50
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.520
Unlike an English comp needs an ending to be a usable word.

51
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.490
Verb endings come in pieces.

52
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.730
The first piece is the conjugation,

53
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.800
which is the grammatical group of verbs that if our belongs to these come in

54
00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:38.260
four flavors.
Ah,

55
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.980
a e n what was originally a nothing value.

56
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.590
These are numbered first conjugation,
second conjugation,
third and fourth.

57
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.050
The verbs you've seen so far of our,
of the AF flavor,
the first conjugation,

58
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.320
these vowels in each conjugation are the verbs theme called it thematic vowel.

59
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.630
So contact has a stem,
meaning sing and a thematic.
Ah,

60
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.460
but it's not ready yet.
We need person in number endings,

61
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.110
which you've already learned.
We Build,
Qantas does for you sing.

62
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.010
Compare that to force conjugation.
Fin,

63
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.650
which is the stem with a thematic e.

64
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.770
So Feeney's means you finish.

65
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.020
<v 3>Okay?</v>

66
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.900
<v 2>[inaudible] means,
see it has the thematic a.</v>

67
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.360
So v days confess.

68
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.720
You seen that he or she sings.
Now,

69
00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:39.380
what do you think the word for she sees was involved?
Your Latin

70
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.320
con content.
So what we see,

71
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.480
what about they see

72
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.100
if you went to site,
the verb conceptually,
but don't plan to name the subject.

73
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.300
Romance has an ending for that.
It's the infinitive

74
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.330
Omari Cantata.
Videira.
Finied.

75
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.020
I know I've been skipping that third conjugation with the zero thematic vow in

76
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:32.830
classical and vulgar Latin.
These often show up with an unstressed,

77
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.060
a like Decatur.
Unlike all the other infinitives.

78
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.020
The emphasis is on the stem,
not on the thematic val,
so it's Dj,

79
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.090
not the chair.

80
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.070
This robust system gets modified in many languages.

81
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.360
For instance,

82
00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:59.160
Iberian languages merge that odd third conjugation into the second door to the

83
00:06:59.161 --> 00:06:59.994
fourth,

84
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.950
the four conjugations and six person numbers are key components of the romance

85
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:16.041
verb system will begin layering tenses aspects and moods onto these components.
