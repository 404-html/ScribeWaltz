00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.423
Hey,

2
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.140
<v 2>the Romans used the first person Pronoun Ego,</v>

3
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.620
which survives in the modern romance languages with the colorful range of

4
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:13.150
pronunciation.
Sure.
Dale,

5
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.550
to address you languages continue using the second person Pronoun,

6
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.060
which is less varied to to do.

7
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.540
Where do

8
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.110
things get more interesting?
When I referred to someone besides you and me,

9
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.980
nominative forms of that word you learned as a definite article drop in for

10
00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:44.560
another visit.
It left for he,

11
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.770
he left where she

12
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.090
actually 11 refers to masculine nouns in general,

13
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.890
not only humans and Isla too feminine nouns.
So for example,

14
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.023
La Casa.

15
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.090
The house is also in the pronoun similar to it or this point too generic nuder

16
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:16.840
items like oak,
significant Sassy sheet.

17
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.870
I can just seniors,

18
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.140
but usually languages express this as a significant on its own.

19
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.090
Return to the second person and inject a bit of culture,

20
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.610
a bit of politeness to be precise.

21
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.880
Modern Romance languages make a politeness distinction,

22
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.510
at least a binary one between familiar and polite,

23
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.590
who is a familiar or informal pronoun.

24
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.330
Polite pronouns vary in Spain,
Portugal and Italy.

25
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.310
Languages innovated.
Third Person Pronouns to speak to you politely,

26
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.960
including Italian Lay,
Spanish and Portuguese.

27
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.010
We'll see how other languages including Romanian Romansh in French use.

28
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.540
Second person,
plural pronouns to refer to you politely.

29
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.410
Where are we?
Have we vulgar Latin speakers had nose,
notch,

30
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.270
loose noise,
no salad throws.

31
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.220
Literally we others also shows up in western languages including Spanish and

32
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.240
Occitan throws.
Who's altars?
Muso

33
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.670
romance languages have a separate Pronoun for the second person,
plural.

34
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.160
All of you.
Volvo's

35
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.090
Voi as with most haltress Oh south trust you others makes an appearance in some

36
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.720
languages.
[inaudible] Boosie elders,

37
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.560
languages that innovate polite third person pronouns in the singular have the

38
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.561
same polite plurals Laura will stay this stage.

39
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.460
Portuguese and Latin American speakers use otherwise formal pronouns.

40
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.480
It was stay this and we'll stitch to refer to all of you.
Well,

41
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.510
we'll still throws and wash our archaic in French and a romance voce doubles as

42
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.930
a singular polite pronoun.

43
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.000
Well,
Shanti means all of you sing as expected,

44
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.970
but also you sir or madam scene,

45
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.110
the plurals of [inaudible] are used for the day as with nouns nominated plurals

46
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.050
ending in a vowel or found in eastern romance,

47
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.260
accusative plurals with a final s in the west elite Romanian,

48
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.223
Yay

49
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.640
or Ilos,
Spanish Agios French II,

50
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.870
Feminine [inaudible] referred to a group of women or feminine plural nouns.

51
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.520
Italian just uses the genitive formed Laurel for both genders.
Instead,

52
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.840
something's creeping back to the surface again and it's that quirk we learned

53
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:24.340
about romance verbs,

54
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.840
pronoun dropping in classical Latin,
vulgar Latin,

55
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.830
and most romance languages verbs normally get used on their own without these

56
00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:38.560
subject pronouns you've just learned kind of throw on its own means I sing,

57
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.380
got into on its own means.
You see,

58
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.250
this is emphatically not true of the French romance or a few of their regional

59
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:51.970
neighbors were the ones optional.
Eggo Canto gives the required,

60
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.950
there's just shot yelled chant.

61
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.250
This is where subject pronouns and verbs interconnect.

62
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.940
They match or agree in person and number.

63
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.730
The subject Eggo goes with Convault.

64
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.260
No swith can't Thomas and so on.

65
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.990
For a sense of this integration.

66
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.530
Take a look at the verb I've been using over and again,

67
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.760
kind of in the present,
indicative with its subject pronouns.

68
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.940
These are the basic personal subject pronouns will build upon as we dig into

69
00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:33.750
object pronouns.
Until then,
keep your Latin vulgar.
