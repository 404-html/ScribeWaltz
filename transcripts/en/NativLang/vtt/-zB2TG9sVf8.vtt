1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.490
Kissing,
clickings sputtering.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.060
These are just some of the odd sounds that people around the world actually used

3
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.280
to speak.
Come here,
these unusual phonemes.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.420
Try them out yourself and find out which one of them is something you say every

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:16.560
day in English.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.030
Weird sounds in world languages,
not my normal fair,

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
but I'm feeling something light.
Before we get into more linguistic tails,

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.290
let's go.
A row of language is all lined up in Africa.

9
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.930
I have a sound written good ba GB,

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.260
so when you've run across this name of a dance from the Cote d'Ivoire,

11
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.470
you might be tempted to go French on it and call it good big debate,

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.450
but notice that tie on the top.

13
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:47.130
It's one single sound to make it bring your tongue up to the soft palate and

14
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:47.964
make a go,

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.650
but also clothes and release your lips during that Gulf for a Combo Gubba sound,

16
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.540
but make me,

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.830
there's a voiceless form to pay in the world.

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.880
Atlas of language structures with its cross language data on common and uncommon

19
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:07.680
sounds.
These are rare enough that they're only an 8% of the language is sampled.

20
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.560
Can you putter your lips like if you're cold,

21
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.090
but that's a bilabial trill.
Phonetically speaking,

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.100
don't pat yourself on the back for it though.

23
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.040
A number of languages use blue and blue sounds,

24
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.280
but in the far reaches of Brazil,
deepen the Amazon lived the Pieta,
Huh?

25
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.840
People whose language has stirred up some linguistic controversy.

26
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.170
One of its unusual features is a bilabial trilled affricate to make it,

27
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.570
they hold their tongue in position for a t sound against the thethe.

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.920
Then release it with that sputtering lip trill.
So

29
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.900
I see why the sound is rare.

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.280
Try this next type of sound might be more familiar to some of you out there for

31
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:49.704
angels.

32
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
The pharynx is straighten the back of your mouth where the nasal cavity connects

33
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.240
to the throat,
connects to the voice box.
If you bring the base,

34
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:01.410
the root of the tongue way back,
the restricted airflow makes this sound.

35
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.700
<v 0>Am I breathing here?
This isn't creepy at all.
Voice that sound and it's aw.</v>

37
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.780
Aw.

38
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.010
Do you know which major world language has sounds close to both of these and

39
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:18.280
expects you to tell them apart from nearby?
Glottal hun Vilar,

40
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.480
it's Arabic and other Aphrodisiac languages in all for NGLs can be found in only

41
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:28.090
4% of the languages in that world.
Sample

42
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.620
a Spanish.
I landed in the canaries off the coast of Africa.

43
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.240
Logo Meta makes him intriguing noises,
unlike the previous examples there,

44
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.920
oddity isn't us sound.

45
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.310
It's actually a whole way of speaking using whistles.

46
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.200
It's called as CBOE,

47
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.230
the whistle by locals who use high or low frequency combined with either flows

48
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.150
or breaks and communicate both vowels and consonants.

49
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 2>The West that</v>

50
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.100
<v 0>lippy trill in Brazil for NGLs in Semitic.</v>

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.130
So far our rares are clustered in hot zones,

52
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.640
but this next rarity is found all around the planet.

53
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.940
Prepare your tongue for dental fricatives.

54
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.360
You won't really need much practice though because English has them

55
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.180
putting the tongue up against the teeth and pushing a stream of air flow around

56
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:22.330
it.

57
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.280
This way is only done in a somewhat over 7% of that world language sample.

58
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.500
Horrified English.
You know how French is infamous for its nasal sounds?

59
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.490
The whole hall French got them when a nosy sounds spread.

60
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:38.920
One val over that happens,

61
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.990
but nasal spreading doesn't have to stop there,
spread away through vowels,

62
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:44.920
through consonants,

63
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.550
until whole stretches of sounds become downright infected with the nasal,

64
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.710
like in the [inaudible] language of Colombia,

65
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.920
we're seeing a suit comes out as seeing awesome.

66
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.980
Lots of odd consonants so far,

67
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:59.590
but I found some fun valves along a river in Wahaca,

68
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.330
Mexico in a town where they speak a must,
a tech language for everyone.

69
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.940
Normal value,
give them,
they have three for you.
Normal,

70
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.490
which link was called modal voice,
but also breathy voice.
Ah,

71
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.690
and creaky voice.
Ah,
they even do this with nasals.

72
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.710
<v 3>Ah,
ah,
AH,</v>

73
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.570
<v 0>add to this that they also have tones.</v>

74
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.500
All these continents you've never tried to tell apart and even their own whistle

75
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.240
speech and you've got yourself a mouthful.
One last one before we go.

76
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.290
Time for the audit speech sounds out there making their home in the southwest of

77
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.120
Africa are the Koyczan languages.

78
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.560
This isn't a single family even though mess comparison struck again,

79
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.820
it's a cluster of families renowned for possessing entire sets of sounds,

80
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.240
cold clicks.
This is a kiss.

81
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.280
I mean a bilabial click kind of even.
It looks like a kiss to make it speakers,

82
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:58.270
close their tongue against the back of the mouth and also close both lips,

83
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:02.170
but don't purse them to closures.
Then using the tongue,

84
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:05.950
they suck a pocket of air into that enclosed area.
Finally,

85
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.040
they let go of the lips and out pops up trapping air between two closures and

86
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:14.320
then releasing.
The front closure can be applied to your teeth,

87
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.540
the side of your mouth,
the roof of your mouth.

88
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400
So much clicking click languages accounted for just 1.8% of that world language

89
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:32.170
sample.
Well,
see,
our world's languages are full of all kinds of meaningful,

90
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.310
strange sounds.

91
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.550
Maybe we'll take a linguistic trip to one of these hotspots and investigate

92
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:40.360
further.
Until then,
stick around at subscribe for language.
