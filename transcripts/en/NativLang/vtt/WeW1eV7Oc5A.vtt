1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.660
Shakespeare didn't sound like this,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.000
and he didn't sound like this either,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.530
but if you were back in 1610 and you snagged a couple of front row tickets to

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:13.230
the globe,
what kind of English would you hear?

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.630
I have a confession,
a tough one for a language nerd.

6
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.160
Here it goes.
I'm never really got into Shakespeare.

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.920
I remember the theater Geeks,

8
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.950
the girl with one hand raised head turned chanting lines to whom?

9
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.093
Exactly.

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.540
Maybe a poetry living squirrel now wasn't for me.

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.150
I was into Legos and languages,

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.530
which is how I ended up unintentionally parsing homer in Greek before I had to

13
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:52.210
face Shakespeare.
Yes.
Had to a class assignment.

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.070
I think it was the tempest.
I skimmed just enough to pass a quiz.

15
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.950
Then I honestly would have shelved the barred forever.

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.230
But for that one stray remark,

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.250
as the theater geeks done their best British accents,

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.850
random gadflies sneered hey,
you know what?

19
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:13.240
Shakespeare really sounded like.
He sounded like us.

20
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.860
Know what had I missed something about Shakespeare,

21
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.130
something that took linguistic detective work to solve something like his poor

22
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:24.484
spelling.

23
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.080
It's there in the bad quartos secretly scribbled by some bootlegger in the

24
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:29.770
audience.

25
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.770
It's there in the good quartos and the first folio to even on his own grave dig

26
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:40.111
and fringed look almost childish and he's stacked they and that keep us

27
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:43.900
simplified.
Dramatic letters.
Thorn.
Hmm.

28
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.030
This isn't his spelling.

29
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.230
1400 Chaucer's English was a very readable Tanga so readable.

30
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:54.490
That's 75 years later,

31
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.480
Mr Caxton imported a printing press to cash in on that readability.

32
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.210
But one day a merchant came to town and ordered eggs.
A woman said,

33
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.930
sorry,
a SPEC nor Frinch.
The merchant got mad.

34
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.610
He wasn't speaking French,
he just wanted some eggs.
Someone jumped in to help.

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.421
Oh,

36
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:18.421
he means a iron Caxton griped low what shoulder man?

37
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:19.211
In these days,

38
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:24.211
new race EEGs or Erin unleash the spelling debates.

39
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.180
How to spell Kenesha when it was evolving into neat.

40
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.590
Should [inaudible] have a C and why?
Oh,

41
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:37.591
why did Chaucer's Val's fall apart so fast by 1600 the ongoing great val shift

42
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:43.780
was turning he into a a became e and o was,
Ooh,

43
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.370
welcome to early modern English.
Shakespeare's tongue.

44
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.750
Good friend.
For Jesus Sake.

45
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.790
For Bay to dig the Dustin Crows that are not here air just of many rhymes that

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.680
well they aren't rhymes anymore.

47
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.750
Play with rhymed with dreaded are with her and own with alone.

48
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.230
You find critters,
raisins,
oh,

49
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.450
we'd find with company shold kept it's all and didn't match.

50
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:21.451
Would extra credit spelled two words that sound like society and rhyme.

51
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:23.500
With variety

52
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.300
you get less and pray and pray and sad,

53
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.060
but then the rhymes with say sweet,

54
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.070
we're all of these actually eat or maybe the was there.

55
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.200
Well,

56
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.200
fortunately we find ear witness accounts of a meat meat merger say was in the

57
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.710
process of merging with see with caution.

58
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.740
Rhymes may even help us recover puns like probably resins and maybe boil and

59
00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:01.610
rhythm like those items.
My teacher made us drum out in class.

60
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.850
Those count how many syllables were in say enclosed two,

61
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.010
two syllables except to hear it demands three and close it.

62
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.900
Meter can also reveal stress.

63
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.490
Not housewifery but as afraid.
Okay,

64
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.410
you're learned.
No.
You see in sand says a noun and a verb.

65
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.140
It's no longer strange for you to hear,
oh,

66
00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:31.670
he knew the Rez and led away and you can stomach the news that Shakespeare's

67
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:35.750
name may have been Shakespeare or schecks bear.

68
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.870
In 1889 Alexander Ellis added one more piece of evidence.

69
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.460
Modern dialects,

70
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.200
dialects contained traces of a time before English had a proper accent.

71
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.650
People who still don't merge meet with Mitt quiches that aren't witches and

72
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:54.920
dropped ours.

73
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.940
H List Arts and Jaron engines sounds downright Shakespearian like some dialects

74
00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:05.840
still do.
He used both though and polite.

75
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.080
You though us though arch,

76
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.800
you'll have your and the third person like in Sheth was still competing with us

77
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.650
and we'll data crunchers deflate legends of his peerless vocabulary.

78
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.430
He was endlessly inventive with meaning and syntax.

79
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.030
Try out this word,
order voy with death and with reward.

80
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:35.031
Did threaten and encourage him not doing it on being done playful a tangle for

81
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.340
audiences to entire on the spot.

82
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.350
So what about listening to a whole play?
Linguists,

83
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.620
David Crystal tested that in a newly reconstructed globe,

84
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.190
thrown back into an era of standing heckling and oop original pronunciation.

85
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.390
Play goers detected suspicious traces of one particular dialect,

86
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.090
their own.
There's something universal about learning to pronounce.

87
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.420
We all come as strangers to Shakespeare's sounds.

88
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.020
Whether you're a theater geek who quotes hamlet by heart,
or you're me,

89
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.860
who I'm about to finish animating this and read it for the very first time,

90
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.230
I think you patrons for unlocking this and keeping me creating and to everyone

91
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:22.160
watching,
are you privy Tyree?
I'm subscribing for language.
