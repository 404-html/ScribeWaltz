00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.263
Okay,

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.410
<v 1>we'll come back to the grammar of words.</v>

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.610
Last time we talked about general concepts morphemes,
Alan Morse,

4
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:18.030
different types of morphemes including affixes,
roots bound,

5
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:19.740
morphine's versus free morphine's.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.690
Go ahead and review that material whenever you need it.
In the next few lessons,

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.180
we'll look at individual parts of speech.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.270
We'll start with nouns and the basic properties of now.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.110
Now these aren't necessarily properties that belong to announce,

10
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.680
they're just properties that will most likely show up and downs in the languages

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.240
that many of you will choose to learn,

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.720
but start with the property known as class.

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.560
Class allows languages to categorize or group notes.

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.240
Class can be based on the form of a noun.
For instance,
in the romance languages,

15
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.480
the nouns ending it's suffix often reveals to announce class nouns that end in

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.040
oh in Spanish are masculine,
but nouns that end in our feminine,

17
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.910
even though eloquent domains,
a room and like I said means a house,

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.000
so there's not much relation between meaning and gender.

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.650
Gender is a category that nouns are grouped into.
There can be some correlation,

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.290
for instance,
in Spanish.
Again when I'm okay,

21
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:20.490
it is feminine and that means a woman and one of them is masculine and that

22
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.250
means a mad.
This holds for Spanish,

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.130
other romance languages and the Indo European family.

24
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Generally Chinese on the other hand actually relates the nouns meaning to the

25
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.400
nouns class.

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.300
There's a classifier word that comes out when you're counting announced and this

27
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.030
classifier shows the nouns class in Chinese,

28
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.430
so these three words in mandarin mean one cup alcohol or one drink.

29
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.450
The Word Bay there isn't necessarily cup.

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.610
It's the classifier for that.

31
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.660
Now in that case we have a language of that marks the announced class more or

32
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:58.890
less based on its meaning.
Now if you haven't dealt with it before,

33
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.990
class can be a tricky concept to get used to,

34
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100
particularly because we no longer have known class are now in gender,
in English,

35
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.120
but we do have the next property we'll explore,
which is grammatical number,

36
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.180
grammatical numbers,
a way to count nouns.

37
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.070
In the example I used earlier in the last video dog is the singular.

38
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:21.030
Now we had the ethics s plural morphine,

39
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.830
which is a bound morphine to form the word dogs.
In that case,

40
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.180
we have a plural noun,

41
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:31.810
so we see that English has an opposition between singular and plural for nouns.

42
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.580
Other languages might have more numbers.
For instance,

43
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.410
in some forums of ancient Greek,

44
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.800
you had a duel number to represent two instances of anatomy,

45
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.160
so there was a singular bulls which would mean a foot or just foot boulder for

46
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.010
two feet or a pair of feet and pull days for more than a pair of feet,

47
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.880
plural.
The final property we'll discuss here is case.

48
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.070
Case really shows the nouns use in a sentence,

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.780
so we'll talk about two basic uses.
The first is a noun as a subject.

50
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.390
When the noun acts as a doer of an action,

51
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.360
it is in the subject or a nominative case.

52
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.000
When announced acts as the object of an action,

53
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.520
it is in the object or accusative case.

54
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.040
Some languages don't distinguish this.

55
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.330
Classical Latin did modern Greek,
Japanese,

56
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.720
and a variety of other languages distinguished this formally.

57
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.770
Take a Latin phrase.
Whoops,
Modem Hubot,

58
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.690
which means the city has a wall.

59
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.080
Wood has a nominative affix,

60
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.500
a case marker telling you that it is the subject.

61
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.560
The city Moodle has an object marker am telling you that it's an object and

62
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.170
accusative case and how that is the verb.

63
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.980
So you know that the city has a wall and not that the wall has a city.

64
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.580
Because in Latin word order doesn't matter as much.
In English,

65
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.730
we show the subject and the object by word order.
In other words,

66
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.480
we placed the subject before the verb and the object after the verb and we avoid

67
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:04.630
these case affixes.
Okay.

68
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.610
We now end up with three basic properties of nouns,
case number in class,

69
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.760
we can differentiate forms of nouns and languages,

70
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:14.800
especially in fusional or gluten,
Advil,

71
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.030
languages that we'll mark these properties and if we differentiate all these

72
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:20.770
forms and we laid them out in a chart,

73
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:23.620
we can come up with the entire declension of a.
Now,

74
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.080
sometimes this will be very basic.

75
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.350
Sometimes this will be very complex in a language like Latin or ancient Greek or

76
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:33.340
Russian or Turkish.

77
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.490
You have a variety of noun forms in other languages like Chinese or Hawaiian.

78
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.460
We don't really talk about the declension of unowned because the noun has one

79
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:44.560
basic form and that applies everywhere.

80
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.920
I hope this video has been helpful and please join me next time when we will

81
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:51.180
talk about how verbs work.
