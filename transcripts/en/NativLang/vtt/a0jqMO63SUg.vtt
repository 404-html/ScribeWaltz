00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.620
Writing,
reading,
typing,

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.833
texting.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.700
Written language is just one of those things that's always been around.

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.340
It's a natural way for you to use words.
It's a given,

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
but there is something you've forgotten.
It's understandable after all,

6
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:24.210
it's been a very long time.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.613
<v 1>Okay?</v>

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.650
<v 0>A long time since no one on the planet knew how to write.</v>

9
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.560
Our story starts with the legend,
the tale of thought.
No,

10
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.200
that's not a list.
Beer hearing,
soften,

11
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
feminist south and Thalamus after the Egyptian God,
thoughts and Vince writing,

12
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.770
he runs to Kink,
famous to share this discovery,
but to his Chagrin,

13
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.580
the king isn't impressed at all.
Looking down his nose,

14
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.980
he starts pontificating on the destructive power of this new fangled technology.

15
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.050
Oh,
clever thought.

16
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.460
This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of learners with the

17
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:21.210
neglect of their memory because their trust and writing comes from strange

18
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.090
external marks and not their own internal recall.

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.150
The drug you've discovered isn't a memory enhancer,

20
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.340
but I'm mentioning enhancer and you're offering students pretend wisdom not

21
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.130
truth.
This sounds strange.

22
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.220
It's easy for you and your world full of writing to dismiss [inaudible],

23
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.463
but here I'm out.

24
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.820
He brings you back to the early days of writing when it was the hot new thing

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.350
and like many other inventions,
not everyone was on board.
Okay,

26
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.220
so let's say for the sake of argument,
you don't want writing.

27
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.690
What are the alternative technologies?
You could bust out your advocacies.

28
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.960
They'll help with counting and doing complex calculations.

29
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.730
Maybe you prefer icons,

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.630
ritualized images that help you relate to culturally significant figures,

31
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.950
event and attitudes.

32
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.120
The Keith who is an amazing ink and information storage system using courts

33
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:16.170
colors and not,
oh,
and don't overlook rope memorization.

34
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.820
Basic option,
sure,

35
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
but it's really useful in preliterate societies were sentences can be memorized

36
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:26.400
and recited by the thousands.
You're brain is bigger than you think.

37
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.320
Perhaps you prefer a petroglyphs rock carvings with major cultural ties that may

38
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:35.070
refer to nearby places or animals.
Ooh,
watch out writing.

39
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.960
We're getting uncomfortably close.

40
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.170
All of these inventions helped humans keep track of their thoughts.

41
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.020
So what makes writing different?
What's them as afraid of?

42
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.160
Let's talk some ness embeddedness.

43
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.020
These things are all embedded in minds.
Tasks,
rituals,
events,
cultures.

44
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.970
Rip Them from those contexts and you ripped out their expressive heart thoughts.

45
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:58.980
Drug doesn't come with so many strings attached.

46
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.070
It will DM bed you letting you record any specific thoughts and letting future

47
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:07.840
generations read it in any context.
So human was famous,

48
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.580
right?
Is writing an unnatural intrusion or do you want to swallow thoughts,

49
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.930
pill and see for yourself what we actually unleashed when we invented writing?

50
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.530
<v 1>Ooh.</v>
