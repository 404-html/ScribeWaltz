1
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.450
Okay.
Yeah.

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.740
<v 1>My previous lessons with debt arguments and truth and logic and they introduced</v>

3
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.460
the difference between truth and validity.
In evaluating an argument.

4
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.140
As you may have noticed,

5
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.950
neither of the language of logic nor the ways of forming and analyzing an

6
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:31.600
argument guarantee the truth of the statements,
the premise season conclusion.

7
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.460
Within that argument,
the toolkit of logic doesn't generate truth.

8
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.540
Instead,

9
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.770
it allows statements to remain true throughout the process of developing an

10
00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:42.604
argument.

11
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.960
We might call it truth preserving rather than truth producing.

12
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.700
We can analyze the function of every one of the operators you learned in the

13
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.820
logic as a language series within that context of truth preservation.

14
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.940
This is normally done using something called a truth table.

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.130
So far speaking,

16
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:07.270
generally I've been careful to separate content from form.

17
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.860
Now let's move towards integrating these two aspects of statements.

18
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.200
By considering truth values,

19
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.140
I'll be using just two basic values,
true and false.

20
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.780
To start with the simple analogy,

21
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.020
this is like a light switch with the value on or off the switch sends a signal

22
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:33.970
to a light which may also be on or off the switches.

23
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:37.180
A variable.
In a statement like a proposition p,

24
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.180
the light is the value of the entire statement.

25
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.180
If I give you two statements,
p and Q,
can you tell me what they mean?

26
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.580
No,
because they're just variables and you don't know what they represent.

27
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.210
So then can you say nothing about their content?

28
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.200
Think for a moment in the lesson on arguments,

29
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:03.310
we looked at an argument with the form p implies Q,

30
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.130
p,
therefor Q.

31
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.440
It's well formed meaning if we fill it with true statements,

32
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:13.210
the conclusion will be entailed.

33
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.930
It is possible to say something about p then it can be true or it can be false.

34
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.630
And the same goes for Q.

35
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.330
By looking at the operators and the form of the argument,

36
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.990
we can pass that truth down to the conclusion.
Well,

37
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:32.140
we don't know the specific value of p or Q.

38
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.770
We can say things that hold for every possible truth,

39
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:40.630
value in combination and declare the resulting truth value of the statement as a

40
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:45.520
whole.
If p is true,
then the statement p is true.

41
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.550
If p is true and Q is true,

42
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.370
then the statement p and Q is true.

43
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.760
If p is false and Q is false,

44
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.160
p and Q is false.

45
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.120
See you can say about the truth of the statements.

46
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.000
We're going to dive into specifics but first let's test to see if you get the

47
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.630
gist of logical values.
Assume p and Q,
Stanford,

48
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.540
two different random propositions or sentences.

49
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.760
I'm going to give you a value for P and a value for queue and you'll tell me if

50
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.380
the statement that follows is true.

51
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.340
Let's say we have a proposition.
Pete,

52
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.340
I'm going to bring back our light switch analogy.

53
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.480
P is a switch and p can be on or off.

54
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.070
The negation not turns the value of p around.

55
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.500
If p is true then not p is false and vice versa.

56
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.460
If we add another not the negation is negated,

57
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.410
so not not p is true when p is true and false.

58
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:18.670
When p is false,

59
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.230
the conjunction and joins two propositions,

60
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.410
so you have to pay attention to both of their truth values.

61
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.360
P may be true when Q is true,

62
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.630
false when Q is true and so on.
As we've seen before.

63
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.930
The statement p and Q will only be true if both p and Q are true.

64
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.470
In all other cases it is false.

65
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.030
The light is lit only when both switches are on.

66
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.393
<v 0>Hm.</v>

67
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.010
<v 1>Inclusive or is true when either p Q or both p and Q are true.</v>

68
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.370
The light goes on when at least one switch is flipped.

69
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

70
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.850
<v 1>On the other hand,</v>

71
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.270
xclusive or expects that either one or the other statement is true but it is

72
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:19.800
false when both statements are true.
As a reminder,

73
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:24.420
this is the kind of or you use when you ask do you want to leave today or

74
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:29.421
tomorrow where you exclude the possibility of today and tomorrow the light turns

75
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:33.240
on when either one of the switches is flipped.

76
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

77
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.640
<v 1>The logical implication is frequently used and for some learners it's a bit</v>

78
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.100
tricky.
If p is true,

79
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.200
then Q is true meaning p implies Q holds.

80
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:52.030
If p and Q are both true,

81
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.270
p implies Q is false.

82
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.600
If p is true and to Q is false in that case p wouldn't imply queue.

83
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.500
It would imply not queue.

84
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.370
If p is false and Q is false,

85
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.610
then p could still very well imply cue.

86
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.860
So the implication holds true.

87
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.610
The last case where P is false and Q is true is an interesting one.

88
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.450
Something besides p might imply cue.

89
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.150
So the implication still holds.

90
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.620
P implies Q holds true and less ps true and Q is false.

91
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.910
This is like a light that goes on when switch P is on.

92
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.630
If the switches on than we expect the light to be on,

93
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.680
but the light might also turn on from some other switch.

94
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.580
So the switch p being off doesn't make the statement.

95
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.270
If piece flipped on,
then the light is on untrue.

96
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.840
Only one thing can make that statement if pees on the light is on false turning

97
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.670
p on and finding the light off.

98
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.500
Finally,
the bike conditional means that the two propositions,

99
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.500
p and Q have the same value.

100
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.010
The statement p if and only if Q is true when both p and Q are true or both p

101
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:26.210
and Q are false.
In any other case,
the bike conditional is false.

102
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.710
This makes the two propositions logically equivalent,

103
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.840
so they must return the same value.

104
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.490
I encourage you to go back through these operators filling in p cubed with

105
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:48.591
propositions you take to be true or false and spend some time reflecting on the

106
00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:53.730
logical truth values.
If the result is a statement,
this will be a good exercise.

107
00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:58.230
It'll help you familiarize yourself with truth tables and clear up some

108
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.730
ambiguities in your logic.

Yeah.
