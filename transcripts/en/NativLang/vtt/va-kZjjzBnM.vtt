00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.993
Okay.

2
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.410
<v 1>In the last lesson I brought up the concept of the verb as a function word that</v>

3
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.270
has a number of different arguments.

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.660
We didn't really go into the implications of that statement,

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.060
but we'll start to unravel it this time.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.300
Like other verbs give has a number of slots that take a certain number of nouns

7
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:31.770
are pronouns give has three of those slots.
To be specific.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750
It expects three arguments,
so I give it to him.
Make sense?

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.930
But I gave it kind of withholds information were expecting and I gave,

10
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:47.781
leaves us with two slots that are not filled as I described before.

11
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.980
Those slots are filled by arguments,
which are nouns and pronouns.

12
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.260
Let's talk about the number of those arguments.

13
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.230
Verbs can be described by their [inaudible],

14
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.040
which is a fancy way of talking about the number of arguments that a verb

15
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:07.490
requires.
Valence is specific to a single verb,

16
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.800
a verb like run,
expects one argument,
the subject,
so it's called monovalent.

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.420
Divalent verbs expect to like the verb.
See,
okay,
I see it.

18
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.560
She saw them try.
Vaillant verbs include give as an,

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.850
I gave it to him.

20
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.600
The label monovalent divalent and try Vaillant depend on the core arguments,

21
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.260
the arguments that are required for normal use of the verb in question.

22
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.480
We can of course add extras in the form of adjuncts.

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.470
She saw it on Thursday,
she saw it on Thursday with her brother,
et cetera.

24
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.530
We can look at it another way by focusing on transit tivity transitivity

25
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
considers what type of objects to verb takes.

26
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.140
Transitive verbs take a direct object.

27
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.560
I say John sees her because see takes a direct object in this case her in

28
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
transitive verbs to not take a direct object.
You would say I slept,

29
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.700
but probably not.
I slept them because sleep is an intransitive verb.

30
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.620
We can make a further distinction between intransitive verbs and die transitive

31
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:15.454
verbs.

32
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.990
I gave it to him as both a direct object and an indirect object,

33
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.090
so it's a dye,
transitive verb.

34
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.620
Defective verbs are curious class and they include verbs with only one fairly

35
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:33.310
meaningless,
phenomenal subject.
That subject fills a grammatical function.

36
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.560
The so called whether verbs are great examples,
it rains,
it snows,

37
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:39.394
it hails.

38
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.600
Those all have a subject it that we don't switch out for another subject.

39
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.840
Like Steve Snows the Pronoun.

40
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.430
It is a dummy pronoun that just stands in the slot simply because we expect to

41
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.970
have a subject.
This isn't a full fledged argument here,

42
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:58.870
so when it comes to valence,
see,
we call these a Vaillant verbs.

43
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.330
That's a good way to start thinking about the number of arguments that a verb

44
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.860
has come around.

45
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:09.640
Next time we're going to start discussing the type of arguments.
