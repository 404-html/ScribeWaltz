00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.260
When I hear people bring up grammar in daily conversations,

2
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.490
most of the time it's interchangeable with proper grammar.

3
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.350
Ain't ain't a word.

4
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.620
Double negations are ungrammatical always use who as a subject but whom as an

5
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:34.420
object following these kinds of rules makes your speech sound polite,

6
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.540
educated and prestigious.

7
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.600
This proper grammar is telling you how to use your language.

8
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.940
Linguists call it prescriptive grammar because it prescribes certain words and

9
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:49.870
structures.

10
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.310
If prescription demands that you follow certain grammar rules,

11
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:55.870
it's a linguistic do.

12
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:59.800
This prescription prohibits you from breaking rules.

13
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.170
It's a linguistic,
don't do that.

14
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.180
But now you've come over to the native Lang Channel and you've started watching

15
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:11.020
the videos here and these videos talk about grammar differently.

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.580
You learn that in Katelyn,
a language native to eastern Spain.

17
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.060
They put articles before proper nouns.
I filled the ledge.

18
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:24.040
Dwana literally means the son of the Joanne,

19
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.210
but that's how they say the son of Joanne or Joanne Sun.

20
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.880
Maybe you even find out that in earlier English double negatives were common and

21
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:38.260
expected like in non the dose the nun thing.
Ask Him,

22
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.850
Yup,

23
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.850
that is English and it literally means no one dared not ask nothing.

24
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.190
These are real life descriptions of language.

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.720
This is descriptive grammar.
Notice the difference.

26
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.700
One approach attempts to dictate how speakers ought to speak their language.

27
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.660
The other one captures and documents language objectively as it is being used,

28
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.610
not as some people wish it were used.

29
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.700
Historical descriptions show us that prescriptive rules go into and out of

30
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:16.090
fashion.
Double negatives were once mainstream in English,

31
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:17.620
but now they're marginalized.

32
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.910
Cultural differences show us that prescriptive rules don't apply to all

33
00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:25.870
languages,
so they're not fundamental to human language or grammar.

34
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.390
Yes,
from this perspective,

35
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.220
the prescriptive rules you hear from Grammar Geeks and style guide sound flighty

36
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:35.680
and incidental,
but before we shout,

37
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.300
nobody tells me what to do and race to dump prescriptive ism in the trash.

38
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.120
Let's think about the possible upside.

39
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.470
Establishing a standard language could boost social cohesion,

40
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.990
monumental works of literature,

41
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.640
standardized reference resources like dictionaries and the education of a highly

42
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.641
literate population traditionally involved and maybe even depend some amount of

43
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.540
prescriptive ism,

44
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.650
prescriptive ism and descriptive ism.

45
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.230
Both talk about language use,

46
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.300
but both of them stopped short of offering a model of human language.

47
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.970
A model explains human language.
It's a theory of language.

48
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.270
For example,
chomp skin theories of generative grammar.

49
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:26.860
See Language as a group of rules that once activated in the right way will

50
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:30.880
produce the structure of the specific language.
On the other hand,

51
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.500
functional theories of grammar see language as a linguistic instrument for

52
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.230
communicating in social situations.

53
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.220
Prescriptive,
descriptive,
theoretical.

54
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.030
You'll sound smart when you get the chance to work these concepts into at least

55
00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:48.590
one upcoming conversation.

56
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.390
What's more now you can see some of the reasons behind dividing the study of

57
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:55.400
language into different fields.

58
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.970
I hope you've enjoyed this topic as much as I have.

59
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.560
Please subscribe for more on linguistics,
languages,
and logic in the future,

60
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.000
and thank you for learning with me.
