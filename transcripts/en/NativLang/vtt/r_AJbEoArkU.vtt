1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.010
Europe always struck me as a land full of languages.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.990
Big Ones like German and Italian ones you may have never heard of like freely in

3
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:10.760
or visio.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.120
Yarish gazing over from the u s it looks like a linguistic playground.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.810
Ask the experts though and you might get a different view.

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.900
A grammatically flat vanilla uniform Europe where the language is shared.

7
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.620
Common.
You're reversals.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.940
It's the 1930s Benjamin Lee wharf is struggling to understand how the Hopi talk

9
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:39.570
about time.
Wait,
but hope he's not a European language.
I know we'll get there.

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.870
Warf is about to make a controversial breakthrough.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
The Hopi don't have concepts for past,
present,
and future.

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.260
He says because they speak Hopi.
We on the other hand,

13
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:56.760
do see time this way because we speak standard,
average European.

14
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.240
Even if you've never set foot in linguistics class,

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.550
you've likely heard part of this claim before.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.000
The concepts in your mind are relative to the language you speak,

17
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.090
but I don't see as many of you debating that second part,

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.080
the standard average European.
I'm here to change that.

19
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.820
So warf.
Let's say we met a standard average European,

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.020
what would they sound like?
Well,
not like any single language.

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.850
They'd have common patterns that are definitively European.
Now,

22
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:29.160
early attempts to listen for such patterns.

23
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.970
Drew bold conclusions from just a handful of languages.
German,

24
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:36.000
French and English do it.
So it must be European.
Now,

25
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.620
depending on which expert you trusted,

26
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:42.570
it started to seem like any language in Europe.
Both was and was not standard.

27
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:43.740
Average European.

28
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.570
Everyone felt like there was some core heartland of shared European ness,

29
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.520
but they couldn't agree on specifics.

30
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
By the 90s dissatisfied linguists were demanding a more rigorous approach.

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.270
If you can't find one,
make one.

32
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.210
So the European Science Foundation funded euro cheap,

33
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.340
a huge project to collect data about the typology of over 130 European

34
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:06.174
languages.

35
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.220
Everything from word order to tenses and flow of time to the all important

36
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.300
adverbial subordinates.
These are little words like,

37
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.680
because if,

38
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:21.210
although the man responsible for collecting these little words used them to make

39
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:24.210
general statements called Euro versales.

40
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.250
See the field of topology was already hunting for universals things.

41
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:30.840
True of every human language.

42
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.800
So here we have euro reversals about all European languages.

43
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
These make for some light bedtime reading and I promise check out your reversal

44
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.620
number one when you have the time,

45
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.370
the hunt for your reversals didn't stop at grammar though like in this more

46
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:52.371
recent search for widespread idioms where we discovered that shedding crocodile

47
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.000
tears isn't unique to English.

48
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.510
At least 45 languages in Europe were found a fake.

49
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.980
They're sobbing with the same of phrase,

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.380
but all of these researchers admit we're still lacking important data.

51
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.630
What's wrong with our picture?
What are we still missing?
Well,

52
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.930
it's one thing to read your reversal number one quite another.

53
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.380
When the author goes on to say this could just be a universal,

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.970
it's one thing to find out that Europe cries crocodile tears quite another.

55
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.990
When you learn the same idiom appears in Swahili and Mongolian.

56
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.960
If we want to know what makes Europe unique,

57
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.590
we need to compare non European languages.

58
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.850
We got that comparison in 2001 finally a serious look at features pervasive in

59
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.990
Europe but uncommon around the world.
What was it?
All our cane,

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.760
thorny grammatical nitpicks.

61
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.380
Actually most of it is straight forward stuff here.

62
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:53.530
Let's play a game called you might be a European,

63
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.950
you might be a European.
If you have a word for both d and a,

64
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.800
you might be a European.

65
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.801
If you use have as a helping verb saying things like have done and have seen you

66
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:05.800
might be a European.

67
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.880
If you use a little word like then in comparisons you might be a,

68
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.280
yeah,
sorry that got old,

69
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.720
but also if your word for self is different from your reflexive Pronoun.

70
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.970
If you're an English speaker,

71
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:23.710
these might sound normal enough to make you shrug until you got to that last
one,

72
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.480
which works for German and Spanish,
but not English.
It's okay.
It's okay.

73
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.720
I know nobody wants to hear their languages less European than German,

74
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.230
but what if it is,
let's find out.

75
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.620
Let's count these features and score the languages against each other.

76
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.400
Tallying and mapping the nine features that have complete data.

77
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.550
We get a geography of your reversals.

78
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.560
It's a bold and cohesive unit.
Germanic languages,
Romance,

79
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.180
Slavic,
Baltic,
Greek,
Hungarian,
Albanian,

80
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.430
all of them with five or more features.

81
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.940
Then it's a steep drop off down to languages that have hardly any Maltese in the

82
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.440
south.
Baskin Celtic in the West,

83
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.250
Turkish in Georgia and in the east finishing Estonian in the north.

84
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.920
We have our boundaries,
but is there a core,
well,

85
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:19.750
there is one area with a high concentration of nine features right here,

86
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.700
centered around France and Germany dubbed the Charlemagne area,

87
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.740
and I'll notice that English is a couple notches outside of that Charlemagne

88
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:30.550
core,

89
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.050
despite being a close relative of one of the languages and a heavy borrower from

90
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:35.884
another,

91
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.150
we've been calling this standard average European,

92
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.230
but it may not be so standard or average on the world scene.

93
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.000
Instead of default,
it's actually been called downright exotic.

94
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.490
Wow.

95
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.310
Did it a continent and UB sharing exotic features and then convincing us that

96
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.370
these features were just plain normal.
The answer,

97
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.730
but would take up another video and it's really just a bunch of maybes.

98
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
Maybe we can blame the migrations and upheavals of the Middle Ages,

99
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.610
perhaps the widespread use of Latin.

100
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.240
Maybe these languages have constantly been adjusting to one another,

101
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.920
but one thing's for sure,
the search for a genetic root,

102
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.580
a shared ancestry behind these features won't cut it.

103
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.620
Europe's languages,
it seems,

104
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.190
aren't exotically standard and average because of what they've inherited,

105
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.420
but because of what they've shared as they shape the continent into a unique

106
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:34.370
language area.
Well,
except maybe for you,
Celtic and Basque.

107
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.600
Stick around and subscribe for language.
