1
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.553
Yes.

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.233
<v 0>Hey,</v>

3
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.670
<v 3>you already dealt with court order.
When we considered the syntax of romance,</v>

4
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Noun phrases like Isla may have been a day and verb phrases like doomy Ludy

5
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.723
case.

6
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.960
One easy way to build longer phrases is to use particles,

7
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:13.961
specifically conjunctions like and or or mice.

8
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.640
But do wait,
they go,
Uni gone through it.

9
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.770
Scribble.
I sing and I write,

10
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.120
but there's more to full romance sentences than this.

11
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v 4>Okay?</v>

12
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.990
<v 3>Basic sentences have a subject followed by a verb followed by the verbs.</v>

13
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.860
Object.
You wanted to get the love every tattoo.

14
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.910
Illumio.
Amika.
[inaudible].

15
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.460
<v 4>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.720
<v 3>That order remains.</v>

17
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.750
Even if we substitute a pronoun for the subject [inaudible] of course,

18
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.740
we've seen how these subjects can and do just drop out sentences like

19
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.110
[inaudible] current,
vulgar,
Latin,

20
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.060
and nearly all the romance languages besides French match and their closest

21
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:15.894
relatives.

22
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.780
The basic word order changes when we substitute in object pronouns,

23
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.080
he laid [inaudible],

24
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.080
but la La [inaudible] kit or simply Isla de kid.

25
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.570
The order here is subject than object Pronoun.
Then the verb,

26
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.440
this also applies to indirect objects and other small unstressed clinic Pronoun

27
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.020
set cozy up to the verb.
Me.
Laddie Kate.

28
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.423
<v 4>Okay.</v>

29
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.630
<v 3>Negative statements work like affirmative ones and typically add a negative</v>

30
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:00.700
particle known for not before the verb.

31
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.490
Noun d Kit Nandi Katie

32
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.120
<v 4>lovery Tata</v>

33
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 3>that no one also comes before any of the object pronouns.</v>

34
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.840
Elaine leaned [inaudible] get

35
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.063
<v 4>okay</v>

36
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.100
<v 3>in French and Romance,</v>

37
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.740
the Latin negative particle has become weaker and speakers added a new negative

38
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:37.890
reinforcer after the verb to Yona.
Say,
bitch,

39
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.713
you shouldn't sit uh,

40
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.480
these languages along with Occitan can actually delete the original particle

41
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:49.410
before the verb and keep their innovated negative after the verb.

42
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.030
Schipol Sabine Pass for,
I don't know,

43
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.610
other negative words like never and nothing may follow the verb.

44
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.180
This makes double negatives or even triple negation.

45
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:07.020
A regular feature of romance,
AGM or the thin,

46
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.570
either Eleanor,
Ds,
Nada,
yen,
each anemic.

47
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.440
Literally,
she doesn't say nothing or she doesn't say anything.

48
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.690
Questions can keep the structure of affirmative sentences.

49
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.430
He laid the get the levity.
Tata elite dictate the levity.

50
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.390
Tata Ilima Laddie Kit.

51
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.910
The subject may move after the verb to signal that a question's being asked to

52
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.690
Dq salivary tattoo,

53
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.210
<v 4>because to elaborate data,</v>

54
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.750
he led the kids too.

55
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.470
<v 3>Some languages keep the basic word order,</v>

56
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.180
but may prompt the question with [inaudible] literally,
is it that

57
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.630
blow acid to fee

58
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.983
tuna fish?

59
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.430
Sardinian has a question marking particle and move subjects after verbs and who

60
00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:37.094
fucking store

61
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.460
question words like the Pronoun Quid and the adverb Quandl start with a quote in

62
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.760
Latin.
They're moved to the front of the sentence in romance

63
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.540
with dks.
Give views.
Give each,

64
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.070
she says each,
oh meaning,
what

65
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.870
<v 4>do you say?
Sometimes the subject is the one being asked about.</v>

66
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.170
We did get the library today.

67
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.270
<v 3>If it's not,
the subject may still move to the right of the verb.</v>

68
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.890
Do Decay Salivary Tata,
we'd Dk is to

69
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.200
hear you are the subject and what is the object.

70
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.610
This short introduction to basic romance sentences gives us some momentum as we

71
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:38.750
push into more complicated statements.
That's the topic for next time.

72
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.220
Until then,
keep your Latin Volker.
