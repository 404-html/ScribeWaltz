1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.270
Mesoamerican quiz time as tech or Mayan

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.460
as tick or Mayan

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.640
Aztec Word Maya,

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.360
one more as ticker Mayan.
Believe it or not.

5
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.360
These are two totally different languages.
Well,

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.560
almost there are fundamental differences,
but there's also one of history,

7
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.020
strangest linguistic mine melts happening here

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.240
so often I find as texts in Mayans mentioned it in the same breath or the same

9
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:36.990
keystrokes,

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.990
so I can almost forgive you for not knowing the difference between the languages

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.850
almost,
but after we're done here,
no excuses.
Okay.
First,

12
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:49.050
we're not dealing with two languages here,
hardly see Aztec,

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.280
which usually goes by the name.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.140
Now what clear or I guess clear speech is just one branch at the southern edge

15
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.730
of a much larger family tree.

16
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.720
The youdo as tech and language family stretches from Idaho in the u s all the

17
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.300
way down to El Salvador classical.
Now,

18
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.780
what is the language spoken by the people you're probably thinking of when I say

19
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.623
Aztecs,

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.820
but the modern now branch actually includes a whole cluster of closely related

21
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.240
languages and dialects.
Myon is another story,

22
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.290
actually lots of stories because it's an entire language family.

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.910
Each one of these is a Mayan language.
It just to keep you on your toes.

24
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:27.510
Speakers of some of these individually,
which is called their own language.
Maya,

25
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.720
even when we don't to linguists,
this is,

26
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:34.710
you could tech but it's really my aton.
This one here.

27
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.400
It's just the now what will word John [inaudible] meaning foreigner.

28
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
What do they themselves call it though?
Well usually Yucatan,
correct language,

29
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.710
but also Mayan to spot some differences between as ticking mind compare basic

30
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:49.554
words.

31
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.100
My last video was all about the tactical use of the languages and the Spanish

32
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.250
conquest,
Cortez Akeelah and the star of the show.

33
00:01:56.251 --> 00:02:00.570
My seen use now what Anton to turn an empire against itself.

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.560
I'll be pulling examples from these same two languages to show off as tech

35
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.870
versus Mayan.
Just a heads up though.

36
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.690
I have a little more experience with Usi Tech and then Maya.

37
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.560
I once got into another rather different utilize tech and language and I've

38
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.800
spent more time with classical now with then anyone Mayan language.

39
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.500
Hopefully that explains any glitches in pronunciation.

40
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.150
Let me start by hand picking things that stand out about their sounds.
Now,

41
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.710
what will is known for that distinctive?
And for this Solutio,

42
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.230
skip or glottal stop.
That's often between a vowel and a consonant.

43
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.940
It's awkward at first,

44
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.820
but try telling and skipping to get a feel for it for yourself.
Miss,

45
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:41.821
she got [inaudible] besides a couple affricates and a difference between a

46
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.300
regular and a cool made by rounding your lips.

47
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.090
Nothing else is too scary in the pronunciation department.

48
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.390
Now what will only has four vowels?
No,
Ooh,

49
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.370
but it does distinguish short ones from long ones.
Ah,
ah,
ee,

50
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.620
ee.
Also there's this relentless second to last syllable.
Stress bump up,
bump,

51
00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:02.320
bump.

52
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.240
They know which date line Yucatan on the other hand has six vowels and it's

53
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.440
consonants include the ever.

54
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.940
So mine ejective stops that build up and release air pressure.
Call them exotic,

55
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.010
call them aggressive.
Personally,
I like them,

56
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.700
but they're on full display in this Mayan language.
So let me try this.

57
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.510
Cheech versus Cheech,

58
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860
both and all those basic nouns in Maya are simple affair,

59
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.080
often just one syllable.
So now it's like,
Ooh.

60
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.430
And not our ready to use no fanciness,
no plural endings.

61
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.250
Of course this makes compounding super common.

62
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.360
Not necessarily longest word in the world,
kind of compounding,
but still,
Ooh,

63
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.420
not nouns that refer to people are often prefixed with male or female even when

64
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:52.000
that's not information you're used to including an English each.
I Ah,

65
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.060
I ah,
[inaudible] ah,

66
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.550
[inaudible] what about no,
what'll nouns?
Well,

67
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:04.240
I hope you've been practicing your because you're going to need it on their own.

68
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.850
Now what'll nouns have a base plus an ending?
Like may she got,

69
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.390
depending on the last letter in the root,

70
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:14.590
the nounce suffix might take another shape,
which is why house is godly,
not got,

71
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.130
if the noun is alive,
it has an animate plural.
So one may,

72
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.640
she got many may she got inanimate,
Carly stays.
Carly,

73
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.940
your house isn't alive as it now comes the fun part.

74
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.050
Now what we'll announce love to be possessed by possessive prefixes.

75
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.400
Knock off the ending,

76
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.350
attach a pronoun prefix and the parties at [inaudible] my house or Mocha your

77
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:40.810
house.
But definitely not at no Caudalie.

78
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.820
Similar Pronoun Bits are very valuable and you'll cook Dan,

79
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.140
but not in a way that so bound up with every now and it makes it change its

80
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.590
shape,
not uh,
not when not.

81
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.450
It's possible to think of as Tikkun Mayan core words like nouns and verbs is

82
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.190
sentence builders in their own right.

83
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.270
Check out what happens when you build a sentence using just the noun and adding

84
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.560
the subject marker to it,

85
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800
like going from not and will not to Una it in Maya or may she got and DMA she

86
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.080
got in Aztec.

87
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.950
I spent some time with nouns and possessives because this is an inkling of a

88
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.300
similarity worth keeping in mind.
We'll build on it later when it comes to verbs,

89
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.620
both languages care about transit tivity in now what will you take a verb like

90
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.860
Watsi,
Makkah or quad and tack on a subject.

91
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.180
These are the same subjects.
We used to build sentences out of nouns.
Dementia,

92
00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:35.380
she cut the way Etsy,
the Maca.

93
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.630
You can then add in your object knee Maka,
Nick Mcha,
Nicola,

94
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.160
Nicola or even need clock well with that fancy unknown object.

95
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.600
I think trans activity is an even bigger player in Mayan beyond just the shape

96
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:54.310
of the verb in some tenses aspects.
My display,
something called Ergot tivity.

97
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.640
The short story is this.
If a Mayan verb is in transitive than it's subject,

98
00:05:58.641 --> 00:05:59.660
looks like an object.

99
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.960
Take a transitive verb Akaushi where you are the subject and you're still this

100
00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:09.230
subject in the intransitive verb we get,
even though you look different,

101
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.060
this sets Maya and apart from both English and know what since we use the same

102
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.610
subjects for transitive and intransitive verbs,

103
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.970
I am the same and I eat it Nicola and in I fall new Etsy accusative languages

104
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:28.190
versus Ergot of languages that probably just made your eyes glaze over.

105
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.750
Let me resuscitate you with something easier.
Prepositions,
you know these guys,

106
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.160
you've got them in English chunk does got him too and it uses them for location

107
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.930
and relation.
So if you remember the Keene was money,
we can just say,
oh,

108
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.790
ducking for with money.
That's not how not what to works though.

109
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.600
It uses post fixes for these kinds of time and place relationships.

110
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.720
Like the one for togetherness is one more.

111
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:57.900
One with you or location.
Cool.
Cool.

112
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.700
In the house.
These go beyond our prepositions though.

113
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.240
Switch off your Indo European mind and think internationally for this one,

114
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.580
take a little word that seems atomic,
unbreakable,
even like and yeah,

115
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:11.290
and now what?

116
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.590
And is a multipart construction built using a postfix he won.

117
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.160
It's togetherness or with it.
Okay.

118
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:21.950
You are officially a linguistic warrior for sticking with me.

119
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.930
That was just a random grammar sampling,

120
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:26.960
but you now have a gist of the differences between these languages.

121
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.310
Time for the payoff with your refined grammatical Palette.

122
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.880
Let's rewind and play the game again as ticker myon.

123
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.200
<v 0>How's tech or Mayan?
Okay.</v>

125
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.720
As tech or Mayan.

126
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.640
There we go.
But if he couldn't tell them apart before,

127
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:50.530
I don't think it was just sheer ignorance.

128
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.670
You probably had hazy ideas of similarities and no real understanding of the

129
00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:58.840
differences,
but there was something to those similarities.
Something deep.

130
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.910
When you characterize a language,

131
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:04.060
you probably go straight for what we call the genetic relationship.

132
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.600
What kind of language is Spanish?
Why it's a romance language.

133
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.490
What about classical Noah?
You do as tech and of course John Thal Yucatan.

134
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.040
That's my end all true.

135
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.000
And we can go around breaking up pre Columbian Mesoamerican did this patchwork

136
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:22.840
of distinct color coded language families.
If we stop there though,

137
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:24.820
we'll miss out on the best part of the story.

138
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.140
There's another factor that majorly influences language isn't an almost

139
00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:34.060
bizarrely stealthy kind of way when languages even totally and utterly unrelated

140
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:37.990
ones live side by side for a long time.
They start to exchange stuff,

141
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.890
not just candy bar the sugar or can I have your chocolate and is kind of stuff.

142
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:42.401
I mean,
sure,

143
00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:46.000
a Mayan language might borrow has tech words just as people all over the region.

144
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:47.290
We're sharing goods and ideas,

145
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.000
but that didn't leave a huge debt instead of surface stuff like words and
sounds,

146
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:55.470
the languages of Mesoamerica started to trade structure.

147
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.390
I don't want your nouns.

148
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.680
I want the way your nouns and pronouns work to influence my nouns and pronouns.

149
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.020
Linguists call this phenomenon,
uh,

150
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:08.280
Shiprocket Bonet a language area as ticking my and participated in one of

151
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:12.840
history's greatest,
the mezo American language area show and tell time.

152
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.290
What kinds of linguistic mind melds were happening here.
First,

153
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.120
a simple one word order.

154
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.740
Mesoamerica likes to keep verbs away from the end of a sentence.
Verb subject,

155
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.180
object is very mine.

156
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.870
And even though classical now what was pretty free and how you let you order

157
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:31.980
words.
It tended to like verb subject,
object,
or even verb object subject.

158
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.850
The languages that surround Mesoamerica though they totally disagree.

159
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.560
They had no problem with a verb.

160
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:41.850
Vinyl syntax with subject object verb being very,
very common.

161
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.650
And those possessives,

162
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.190
they come back full force with the kind of Awkward Mesoamerican way of saying

163
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:51.720
that somebody owns something.
It's like this,
her house,
the woman,

164
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.450
their bones,
the dogs,
and as tech,

165
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:59.451
I think you'd say econ in see what [inaudible] but it works the same way all

166
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:04.020
over.
Of course,
that core words build sentences concept from earlier.

167
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:04.860
It comes back here.

168
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.900
So have fun with examples like equally [inaudible] back to Mesoamerican post

169
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.190
positions and prepositions.

170
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.000
Those timespace references love to include body parts.

171
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.690
So instead of saying inside,
why not say eat pig?

172
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.510
It's stomach for around use.

173
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.400
Eat DANCO on its lips or try my Upham head for in front,

174
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.390
like bumble taught at head of house for in front of the house.

175
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.230
They even count the same way,
not with your decimal system.

176
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.470
Their system is base twinning as take simple,

177
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.450
wildly 20 is literally just one count.
Units like 80 are easy,

178
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.480
just counted scores [inaudible] four counts as a consequence of your major.

179
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.060
Mesoamerican milestones weren't hundreds or thousands,

180
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.090
but things like 20 squared and 20 cubed.

181
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.280
There's separate words for these like the old Mayan buck or not with Wilson

182
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.280
[inaudible].
All of these and more are features of mezcal America.

183
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.120
Some are even rare outside of it.
Even in the very same language families.

184
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.110
The way to explain them is to look at how these languages converged around the

185
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:14.190
very same traits.
I find this fascinating in a way.

186
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:16.800
It's like you can probably keep the look and feel of your language,

187
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.140
but behind the scenes we'll all agree to work differently.

188
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.670
Similarly not differently.
Well,
thanks for making it through this grammar class.

189
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.720
I know it's a bit of a switch,

190
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.720
but I hope it helps you appreciate the story from last time or you know,

191
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:31.460
the next time you study a modern Mayan language,
modern Mayan language.
Wait,

192
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:33.630
did the Mayans like disappear or something?
Yeah.

193
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.350
And I think that happened when the world ended back in December,
2012 no,

194
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.470
they didn't.
But that's a story for another time.

195
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.260
Stick around and subscribed for language.

196
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
