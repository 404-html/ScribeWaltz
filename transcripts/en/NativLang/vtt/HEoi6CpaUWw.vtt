1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.260
Genghis khan wasn't unusual.
Conqueror,
yes,

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.660
he subdued vast lands from a top a horse,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.250
but he didn't brag loudly across the ages.
He kept secrets,

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
a secret history,
a secret burial,
no images from his life.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.300
Conquered peoples weren't even allowed to learn his language with all this

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.720
secrecy,
could we ever know what is language sounded like

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.020
my first encounter with Mongolian.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.650
Imagine me working at a coffee shop for years.

9
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.760
I spent my morning steaming customized Espresso elixirs for customers to carry

10
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:40.980
out with style,
but after my shift,

11
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:45.720
I'd relax by heading three blocks to the library and picking grammars off the

12
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.680
stacks.
This day I noticed a new book.

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.080
I opened it and met a language that built words mechanically that had val

14
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.880
harmony,
long vowels and an l.

15
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:02.881
It warned me it would be tricky to pronounce fun until one example broke my

16
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:08.070
flow.
Something something,
something Ching is con.

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.530
Suddenly this wasn't just grammar.

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.920
It felt like history Mongolian the Mongols was this the remnant voice of the

19
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.660
Great Khan himself.
I didn't realize it at the time,

20
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.740
but this curiosity would lead me down in epic road.
Books,

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.360
maps a pig roughy late into the night following nomadic hoof prints to chase a

22
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.270
language and if you want in on that journey,

23
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.310
we travel to Mongolia today,
fly into lawn Baltar's,

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.550
the red hero city,
and you'll see one name at the airport on bottles.
Oh,

25
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:45.810
hotel a bank and the character atop top,

26
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:48.750
the world's largest mat on horse statues,
southeast of town.

27
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.240
Not Ganga is calm,
but chicken is hard.
Yes,

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.110
in Cyrillic,
no,
this isn't Russian.
It's Mongolian.

29
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.760
Just like in that grammar endings with vowel harmony post positions,

30
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.840
not prepositions.

31
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.190
Long vowels like hung and L's and L's have

32
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.680
crossed the border into China and you're an Inner Mongolia.

33
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.740
As you look around at shops and signs,

34
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.830
it can be hard to imagine that a roving shrine to Gaviscon once toward this

35
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.760
region for the devout after his death,

36
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.330
but focus above the Chinese and you'll spot some Mongolian in an older alphabet

37
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.410
with toothy consonant vowel letters connected along a cursive spine.

38
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.330
It's unique in the way it's written from top to bottom in a rose from left to

39
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.690
right for beginners.
It's a challenging script.

40
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.680
I mean this thing kind of breaks webpages,
but to ease the pain.

41
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.110
Children here learn it as syllables.

42
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
When they recite words with these syllables,
something strange happens.

43
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.850
Extra unspoken syllables emerge.

44
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.000
The word he can delay.

45
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.460
The Blue City of Inner Mongolia is Cole who quota and the four syllables of who

46
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.110
John Balter are written with six.

47
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.330
Where do these extra syllables come from?
From back in time?

48
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.770
1204 before he is con the up and coming too.

49
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.900
Muchin conquers a tribe to the south,

50
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
the Nema among his new subjects as a scholar Patona who writes in the weaker

51
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.160
script,
which is people inherited ultimately from Aramaic.

52
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.390
There's a whole backstory,
but if it reminds you of rotated Arabic,

53
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.750
there is a reason to move,
maybe illiterate,

54
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.820
but he immediately recognizes the use for is dawning empire and so trusted

55
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:50.440
Mongol Nobles.
Learn to write later that same century.

56
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.980
A great stone goes up with an inscription telling us that is skilled archery's

57
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.990
sooner shot a target from 335 volts away more than half a kilometer.

58
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.050
The first words in the texts reveal who was there to witness it.

59
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.530
Genius harm and his mangled dignitaries.

60
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.040
This is pre classical written Mongol.

61
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.330
It often resembles modern Mongolian like kid is still a good,

62
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.790
but it preserves sounds that have since changed like [inaudible] has since

63
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.200
harmonize to older.

64
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.980
Those long vowels were actually two vowels split by Kahan instead of Han,

65
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.620
which by the way is why Khan also gets spelled with two Oz and I'd heard between

66
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.640
this official written language takes us back to the right time,

67
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.560
but another line of evidence suggested might be suspiciously archaic,

68
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.430
how dignitaries rope,
but not how the cottons spoke.

69
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.170
A crucial piece of the Mongolian story was nearly forgotten.

70
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.390
A history book disguised as a language instruction text was rediscovered by

71
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:03.391
Russian Orthodox Monk Palladium in China in the mid 18 hundreds this book was

72
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:08.410
written entirely in Han Chinese characters,
but despite appearances,

73
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.200
it doesn't make sense if it's read in Chinese.

74
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.980
Listen to the very first words gene geese car hon,

75
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.970
we meet again.

76
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.780
What emerges is a long name filled text telling the inside story of the man

77
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.760
himself.
His origins from Tingey,

78
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.160
his under his blood brother is conquest with his general struggle for
succession.

79
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.710
Even a cameo by that same long shot.

80
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:40.300
Archer Oh and time and again you'll read how in is hand made a decree.

81
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.480
He made a decree saying dot,
dot.
Dot.

82
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.830
It all struck scholars and nomads alike as authentic,

83
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.500
perhaps composed upon his very death.

84
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.310
When Knoebel's gathered together to remember his story,
their story,

85
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.000
and wrote down what came to be known as new Cha Cha,

86
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.690
the secret history.
It's from the right time,

87
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.730
but something felt off.
It had already changed to Udl.

88
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.920
They were already dropping their middle hoods and yet they kept around and

89
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.921
initial hook who Joe would in all of this secret history looked different,

90
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.480
mostly younger,

91
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.560
maybe written Mongol was too old to be the language of the [inaudible].

92
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.920
Maybe this was his middle Mongol.

93
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.320
So why not just roll back today's pronunciation and undo sound changes to revert

94
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:38.190
to our best middle Mongol accent is the question you ask yourself as we travel

95
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:43.160
the open road through the old dose in Inner Mongolia to this site of the muzzle,

96
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:47.210
Liam of Chinks,
hon or those became our horde,

97
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.380
but it means palaces.
His tomb remains a mystery.

98
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.020
Yet after his death tent palaces wandered.

99
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:57.650
This land is a shrine to what one scholar terms Ganga said theology and

100
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.700
terrorism of people called the dotcom vowed to guard it forever and they're

101
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.260
Mongolian is different.
They're not alone.

102
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.940
There are languages in Russia than inherit over 90% of their words from Middle

103
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.720
Mongol.
Well,
one in China keeps less than half as I promised.

104
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:18.620
It's a lot of wandering,
but the point is there's not one Mongolian.

105
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.780
It's among Golick family.

106
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.380
Even my grammar naively titled Mongolian was teaching just one variety.

107
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.960
HEISC linguists sifted through Mongolia cognates to piece together a common

108
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:37.350
ancestor.
Prodo Mongolia had a low,

109
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.010
not it had no F's.

110
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.490
The hug had a or not and a final hadn't merged with [inaudible] so they were

111
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:51.290
saying Kahan has were dropping,

112
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.740
but lingered at the start of words was wrong,

113
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.920
was who lon sometimes evidenced conflicts was their garb.

114
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.770
A dip in or Dicken reveals quirks,

115
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.880
Mongols used echo nouns for and things like that.
Muddy,

116
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.881
muddy for horses and Moross and look so much like Middle Mongol,

117
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.180
like another line of evidence pointing back to the exact same time.

118
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.280
Only 800 years ago.
It's a very young family compared to others we've met.

119
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:29.100
It's hard to reach beyond that.
So here he sits.
Before him,

120
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.800
we detect Turkic loans,
like is very title,

121
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.250
maybe dialects or even a link to this mysterious script after him,

122
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.560
many Mongolia descendants and between a linguistic bottleneck caused by a man

123
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:48.290
who United a people and drew a line in the Gobi sand from which emerged a

124
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:52.130
language family through old texts and modern voices.

125
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.860
We still hear echoes of when he made a decree,
he a decree,

126
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.350
but without saying the sound fun.

127
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.630
So add is linguistic legacy to the many accomplishments of a man who to us is

128
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:07.510
Gaviscon who in Mongolia is remembered as changes harm,

129
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.300
but who in his own tongue may have been chinkies Kahan

130
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.770
stick around and subscribing for language.
