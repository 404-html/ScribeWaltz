1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.740
We the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet handed down to us from ancient Rome and

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:08.940
fitted all be it in perfectly to our English tongue.
Wait,
not so fast.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.950
That's wrong.
This was the Latin alphabet.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.550
The rest of these were just crafted by some clever old school maters.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.860
Yes,
it's true.
Your gs.

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.580
Jay's used W's and wise don't have the ancient pedigree of the rest of your

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.770
alphabet,
but what they lack in antiquity,

8
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.700
they more than make up for and scrappiness.
This is their story.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.150
G was the first to emerge.
Long ago.

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:36.780
Greek God made its way to Italy and turned into Latin.
See,

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.250
but in the early Latin,

12
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.180
the sea actually stood for this sound and this sound cook.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.410
We're still the one letter you might think could straighten things out here

14
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.580
between [inaudible] good and let us differentiate them.
That valley into k,

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.980
well that was going out of fashion,

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.600
but see was still hanging on cooling and going along to linguist.

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.860
That's sensible.

18
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.760
They could tell you all about how these two Vilar stops actually share most of

19
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:06.630
their features and they just differ in one little thing.
Voicing,

20
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.480
but to everyday Romans.
That's little constellation.

21
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.660
The difference was confusing and dangerous.
I mean,

22
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:16.590
does this say he's milking it or does it mean let him beat it up?

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.730
Who knows?
I mean,
it's all seize,
all,
seize,

24
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
calm down and opened the door because here enters spurious,

25
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.910
carved Delia's Ruga a former slave that ran his own private school 2100 years

26
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.530
ago,
frustrated with this to face,
see and unable to even write his own name.

27
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.130
Clearly the story goes that he tacked on an extra stroke,

28
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.950
creating a new g and forever sitting.
See,

29
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:45.330
apart from GE and amazing stroke of genius.
Well,

30
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.030
if seek and have a companion,
why can't you?
Well,

31
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.660
the only you around was actually v from older Greek,
oops salon.

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.530
More on that in a second.
Greek word stage to fashionable Latin.

33
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:59.750
Come back a little after the birth of g and educated writers wanting to fancy

34
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.520
way to write this strange Greek you with.

35
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.280
It's very unromantic sound.

36
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.770
So they borrowed oops salon again,
a new salon,
a second hoop salon,

37
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
a Greek even in today in English,

38
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.630
Greek words like system still have that new letter,

39
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.090
a letter missing from plain old Latin words.

40
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.010
No tweaking sees and borrowing wise's lightweight compared to what comes next.

41
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
The Middle Ages saw the rise of a new letter I with a tail below it.

42
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.720
What was originally a different look,
not a different letter tailed.

43
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:35.370
I gave medieval European language is a way to set j apart from I and that's

44
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:38.070
important because if we roll the story back to the Romans,

45
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.920
we see an overburden letter.
I that had to play both roles.

46
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.940
Take the Latin word for young,
just take it that first.

47
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.500
I was a yes sound,

48
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.070
but the last one's the vowel e similar enough,

49
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:54.180
but linguistically that means I is trying its hardest to be both a vowel e and a

50
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.840
consonant year add in our swishy tail and this is terrified.

51
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:01.990
Jay comes to the rescue as our consonant leaving I just as a valve.

52
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.380
So you when he's,
but that's not good enough.

53
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.960
There's another confusing letter hiding in that word,

54
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.110
and it's the next one on our change list.
Like I,

55
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:15.490
the Latin Letter v covers two sounds of vowel oo and a consonant.

56
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.680
What would we'd call w and that's why we like you when he's,

57
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.650
because it has both of them in a row.
Never fear.
We can sort this out.

58
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.560
Just round out the bottom of that v and what do you know?

59
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.110
It's the value Ra.

60
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.520
But this change actually lingered for centuries in older manuscripts.

61
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.870
TheU is still used as a variant,
a v for both VA and Ooh,

62
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.060
eventually after a long sell,

63
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.450
by the end of the 17 hundreds of two are treated as two totally different

64
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:48.130
letters.
Finally,
we've arrived,
so we have a better way to write you witness,

65
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.080
but listened to old Cicero's pronunciation of that v what he says.

66
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.203
Whoa.

67
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.290
So I glossed over that change when I said that v ended up standing for both of a

68
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.280
and,
Ooh,

69
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.020
but early on that what pronunciation shifted to something pretty close to,

70
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:06.880
but not exactly like our VI.

71
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.970
So by the time little Henry the eighth was studying his Latin,

72
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.560
that V had long been a Va.
Seriously,
Henry fine.
Yes,

73
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.850
this book is yours.
Have it.
Well,
speaking of Englishman,

74
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.360
when early dramatic languages like old English dressed themselves in the Latin

75
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.860
alphabet,
they asked about their new found garb.
Hey,
where's the letter from?

76
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:30.520
My was sound and it didn't answer them back since it's an anatomy metaphor,

77
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.540
but dramatic speakers had already learned to get what they want when Rome was

78
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.730
being withholding.
No exception here,

79
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.940
they cobbled together a new letter of their own by taking that vion,

80
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.700
putting it next to a another v.

81
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.350
Don't forget though that v and you were still two peas in a pod at the time.

82
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:52.240
Each one useful for making an oo sounds meaning you could write this new letter

83
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.150
as a double V or a double you,

84
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.120
but here's where we should jump off the hamster wheel of history because

85
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.170
eventually that German word starts to turn into von its own,

86
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.720
just like the Latin v before it.
Oh,

87
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.900
history really liked to keep your fingers on that replay button,
don't you?

88
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.340
I'd love to go on and compare other alphabets and talk about how or even if each

89
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:17.230
individual European language adopted these changes or didn't or made decisions

90
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:19.300
of its own.
Think about how to this day,

91
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.410
the Irish alphabet makes none of these distinctions except c and g,

92
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.370
but this is a good place to wrap up between last time with the uppercase,

93
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:31.240
lowercase stuff in these modded letters.
I think you can see that,
well,

94
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:35.320
you might think you're alphabet's been aging and evolving since time immemorial

95
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.800
in some very real ways.
It's not as old as you think.

96
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>
