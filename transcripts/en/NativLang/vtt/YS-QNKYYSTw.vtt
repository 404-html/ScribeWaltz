00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.980
The Tower of Babel,

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.850
the story of how one original language shattered into many was one of humanity's

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.270
early attempts to explain languages.
Thousands of years later,

4
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:13.050
linguists investigated exactly how language has evolved when they put the pieces

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:13.800
together though.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.150
Did it look anything like the Babel story or was this just a tall tale?

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.270
So the story goes,

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.560
the whole Earth once spoke the same language via he wholehearted stuff.

9
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:32.850
I have one day they traveled to the land of Sheen odd where they work together

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:37.130
to build a city with a Mcdonald's,
a tower to reach to the skies there.

11
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:41.250
Supreme Deity wasn't having it though and scrabbled their language so they could

12
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.970
no longer understand each other.
This story's stuck.

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.170
Jewish writers speculated what the original adamic language was and how many

14
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:50.460
tongues it's split into.

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.050
Was it 70 or 72 a Persian contended a demic might be Syriac.
Well,

16
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.460
this Syrian went with Hebrew.

17
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.630
Europeans claimed everything from Swedish to Irish,

18
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.170
which apparently just picked out the best bits of those 72 original flavors.

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
Still Hebrew remained the prime candidate after all.

20
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.920
It's the language of this story,
right?
Detail's changed,

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.460
but the interpretation held one original tongue at a single place in time broke

22
00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:19.080
into a bunch of distinct languages in order to keep people from coordinating and

23
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.830
understanding each other.
Then came the 17 and 18 hundreds.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.850
Explorers and trade routes strength the world distant people discovered each

25
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:28.500
other's languages for the first time.

26
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.790
Intrigued scholars found common patterns that shifted our view of the world's

27
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.930
languages.
Some languages consistently look to tweak away from each other.

28
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.400
Take Arabic and Hebrew,

29
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.780
the the IV Waconda and Zaha behind these words.

30
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:47.781
There's a regular sound correspondence where Arabic has the Hebrew has zine.

31
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.710
These were cognates,
the same word,
evolving differently in different languages.

32
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.180
Comparing cognates,

33
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:58.230
a picture emerged of a family tree walking back up the branches of the tree.

34
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.630
You could reconstruct the common ancestor,

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.090
but testing this method in the wild world.

36
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.260
The trails of cognates didn't lead back to a single protal language.
No,

37
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.770
there were clusters of closely and distantly related languages belonging to

38
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.950
separate families.
English,
Irish,
Greek,

39
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:17.940
and even Sanskrit were clearly part of an Indo European language family from the

40
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.820
South China Sea to the eastern Pacific.
The languages of Austrian.

41
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:24.390
Nisha all share their own common ancestor and Hebrew.
Once dubbed,

42
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.540
the original language fits snuggly among its kin.

43
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.240
One twig of an Aphrodisiac family.

44
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.840
It wasn't even the purest or best preserved twig.
For example.

45
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.870
It wore away consonant distinctions that its relatives,
Aramaic,

46
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:39.840
and Arabic kept also change,

47
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.440
turned out to be something languages were doing naturally all of the time.

48
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.720
Babel still held one intriguing idea over us though that original language.

49
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.920
See reconstructions dead ended several thousand years back.
Beyond that,

50
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.490
historical linguists started to feel like they simply had nothing to say.

51
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.000
Nothing to say,
ah,
well tie your own hands,
but you can't hold back a maverick.

52
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.990
So you established families and reconstructed parent languages.
Well,

53
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:06.370
why not do the same thing again?

54
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.180
Compare Prodo languages for cognates and build families on top of families.

55
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.590
Families are coming together.

56
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:16.591
It's a super family entered the late Joseph Greenberg classify languages first.

57
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:21.790
He said,
then compare and reconstruct.
Classify first.
Yes,

58
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:23.440
it's called mass comparison.

59
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.530
Take a huge number of languages and look for patterns in them,

60
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.410
patterns and vocabulary,
but also in their topology,

61
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.440
the comparative structure of the world's languages.
You know,

62
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.160
stuff like how many vowels does it have?
What's its basic word?
Order?

63
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.080
He cast his net wide and cut some huge and controversial super families into

64
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:46.081
European Turkic Mongolian Japanese and more belonged to your Asiatic and this

65
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:47.560
one drew tons of flack,

66
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.670
but the complicated languages of the Americas are one happy Amarin to family.

67
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.160
Then in the nineties merit Ruhlin ran all the way he compared vocabulary from

68
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.760
across the globe and reconstructed 27 Prodo words.

69
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.170
Here it was our first look at the parent of all living tongues,

70
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.520
prodo world or pro human and produce sapiens if that's your style.

71
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.190
Prodo world had words like thick,

72
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.420
cool Ma Aqua [inaudible].

73
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.050
A decade later,
he went after the type pathology of Proto world.

74
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.250
Apparently our ancestors spoke their sentences with a subject than an object

75
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:28.900
than a verb.
They put adjectives before nouns,
and instead of prepositions,

76
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.930
they used post positions where we finally staring into the face or the tongue of

77
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:38.410
that long lost the original language.
Historical linguists said,
Nah,

78
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.970
and they tore into these results.

79
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.240
These short words could easily be chance look alikes.

80
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.100
You can't account for borrowings.

81
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.940
The meanings of your cognates are all over the place were flimsy method.

82
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:52.150
Let's you base reconstructions on irrelevant evidence.
Thus,

83
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.140
they confidently tossed mass comparison into the bins of fringe linguistics,

84
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.280
pseudoscience.

85
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.660
And yet babbles first and biggest claim lingers.

86
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.330
The mavericks still swear we're onto something.

87
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.960
Are we or are they telling yet another tall tale?

88
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.440
Stick around and subscribe for language.
