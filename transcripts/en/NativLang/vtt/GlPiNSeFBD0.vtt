1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.700
These words having common.

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.530
There's a door in my house I never opened

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.510
even in October.
When I hear that strange knock knock,

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
your probably suspicious that things like these are lurking on the other side of

5
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.430
that door.
Words that hide the unknown,

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.010
but you're not scared by playing lexical items.

7
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.040
I mean you need context and narrative.

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.410
A scary story.

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.310
The kind that has an unknown [inaudible] psychologically intimidates your

10
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:45.240
characters.
Add plus one points.
If the medicine is linked to wider social ills,

11
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
a sense of despair or hopelessness that comes over your audience as they fear

12
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.650
that the menaces to powerful,
to handle a McGuffin,

13
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.970
a person or object that drags us into the depths of fear without distracting us

14
00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:00.240
from the main story.
A plot twist for added suspense,

15
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.570
and if yours is a psychological thriller,
add another plus one.

16
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:07.590
If by the end we find out that the narrator telling us this true tale is also

17
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:12.000
unreliable.
So there's your scary story checklist,

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860
good night,
happy Halloween.
What?
Where did it come from?

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.590
Okay,
sure.

20
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:24.270
The storytellers of old knew how to spin tales with monsters and ghosts,

21
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.770
like in Homer's Odyssey,

22
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.920
spirit possession in lady Merce sockies tale of Genji or even spooky settings as

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.380
Dante's inferno,
ancient Sanskrit,
drama theorists,

24
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.390
even shrewdly separated that personal feeling of anticipation you have sitting

25
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:46.350
there alone with your heart beating faster,
faster,

26
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
and faster from the shared sentiment of error that descends over the entire

27
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.170
audience and the reaction of follows.

28
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.670
But these high artists,
we're focused on telling a perfectly balanced tale,

29
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.340
not indulging our fears for hours on end.

30
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.150
And then there's folklore,

31
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.890
local lowly tales of the shape shifting us Swang haunting the forest of the

32
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.770
Philippines

33
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.990
or of spirits exiting the other world to walk the earth during the Celtic Salad.

34
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.390
So in the very same harvest holiday behind our Halloween ha folklore and a whore

35
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.070
are both full of strange,
mysterious supernatural tales.

36
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.680
But the path from one to the other isn't really direct.
It took her reaction,

37
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.520
the kind that happened in the enlightenment as you're up grew more and more

38
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.920
rational,
sophisticated,

39
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.210
and then romanticism reacted with pure,
raw emotion.

40
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.050
Usually those emotions were nice emotions,

41
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.000
but of course not all emotions are nice.

42
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.490
One of these emotions was the sublime,

43
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.810
the immense shock and all you feel when looking at mountains are huge gothic

44
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.320
buildings.
Philosopher Edmund Burke talked about this.

45
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.321
The idea of horror and terror being feelings of the sublime pain and terror are

46
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:19.270
capable of producing delight,

47
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.920
assault of delight for a sort of tranquility,

48
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:27.640
twinged with terror.
We want to be scared.

49
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.990
We enjoy it.

50
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.530
How sublime novelists took this dark emotional journey and created the gothic

51
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.950
trend around that time turning medieval castles,
towns,

52
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.480
priests and monsters into objects here over time,

53
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.081
novels,

54
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:48.790
movies and games capitalized on these dark emotions to engineer our scary story

55
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.640
checklist,
take that funny word,
McGuffin.

56
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.800
Sure our story needs a menace,
fear,
uncertainty and surprise.

57
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.170
But Alfred Hitchcock thought,

58
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.280
what if we add an extra item that grabs our interests and pulls us along?

59
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.470
Here's a recent example,
sort of reason I was little,

60
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.690
little skeleton key may not ultimately determine whether or not the spirits in

61
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.030
the attic loose snatch our bodies tonight,

62
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.890
but it certainly keeps us curious long enough to stick around and find out what

63
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.910
happens next.

64
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160
Modern horror uses elements like these to tighten our experience of fear from

65
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:25.450
start to finish.

66
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.730
So from folklore to rationalism to romanticism to gothic to modern horror,

67
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.980
we have a whole history of scary pros to thank for this basic checklist,

68
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.120
we've come to love or fear,
love to fear.

69
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.370
