<v 1>Hello and welcome to the fourth lesson in native link dot coms introduction to</v>

3
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:17.510
historical linguistics and language change.
Last time around,

4
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:22.490
we looked at some basic words in three lift Tineke or romance languages and

5
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:24.680
determined how they were related to each other.

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.660
We also filled out their family tree back in time and saw that they had this

7
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:34.661
relationship dependent on the existence of some common ancestor that was an

8
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:37.130
actual language spoken in the past.

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.920
We also determined that if we didn't have a tested data for that language,

10
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.480
we'd have to go back and reconstruct the language to know what it was like.

11
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.041
In this lesson,

12
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.000
we're going to do some of those basic reconstructions to determine the shape of

13
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.510
an ancestral language that isn't a tested.
In other words,

14
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.100
we have no written records of it.

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.840
We're going to start with some fresh data from an few new languages.

16
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.600
These are all Polynesian languages.

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.420
I'll start out by saying they're all related to each other.

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.990
We're not trying to determine here if they're related,

19
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.190
but rather what is the common ancestral form that these cognates all share.

20
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.510
These cognates all come from some one word in the past.

21
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.700
What was the shape of that one word?

22
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.410
So here are some words for numbers in these languages.
As you can see,

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.600
the forms are all very close.

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640
It's easy to tell based on this data at least that the languages are related.

25
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.550
I've given you the IPA forms,

26
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.660
the international phonetic alphabet forms of these words because we need to look

27
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:45.620
at sounds and sound change to determine how these words changed.

28
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.870
If you're not familiar with the IPA,

29
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.310
even though this symbols used here a fairly basic,
I have a whole lesson on that.

30
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.660
I'll put a link to it below.

31
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.370
I also need to introduce you to innovations and retentions,

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.680
innovations or changes to ancestral forms that were introduced at some point in

33
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:04.514
the past.

34
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.260
They may occur in one language or they may be shared by a group of more closely

35
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:13.970
related languages.
Retentions are those forms in this case,

36
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:16.670
the sounds that go back to the common ancestor.

37
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.470
What we need to do is determine which of the sounds here our retentions and

38
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.260
which are innovation.
Once we can do that,

39
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.370
we can posit common forms that must have occurred in the parent or the

40
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:29.780
reconstructed language.

41
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.220
One simple innovation shows up pretty quickly as we look at this data.

42
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.600
Notice that Hawaiian always has this prefixed material,

43
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:41.480
this a in front of every single number.

44
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.640
This shows up only in Hawaiian and not in any of the other languages.

45
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.270
We have good grounds for assuming that this is an innovation.

46
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.730
We don't have hard proof here,

47
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:57.020
but the common material to all of these numbers does not include that a,

48
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.190
so when we're looking the Hawaiian numbers,

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.400
the common material is everything after that a,

50
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.860
so let's compare individual sounds.
Notice the phoneme t,

51
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.640
the voiceless dental plosive that shows up in most languages,

52
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.470
but also noticed this curiosity that some languages instead of having the

53
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.471
phoneme t have this voiceless Vilar stop instead of the voiceless dental stop.

54
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.910
In this case,

55
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.910
there's almost something like a democratic vote by the languages against the

56
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.220
Vilar Plosive,
the k sound being the original phony.

57
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.390
We have a pretty good indication that t was an original phoning,

58
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.360
a retention that changed to the innovation.

59
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.190
K It has specific language in Hawaii,

60
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.960
so we choose t as the ancestral inherited retained phoneme in all of these

61
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.800
languages.
That then changed to a k in some instances,

62
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.770
but it would be lazy of us to stop there.

63
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.380
We should go and confirm against further data.

64
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.510
What we'd find is that this is indeed the case where there's a k and Hawaiian

65
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.750
other cognates in other languages have a tea and vice versa where there's a t in

66
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.340
the other languages there's a k and Hawaiian,

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.490
so this seems to be confirmed across the board.

68
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.420
We can posit some tea in the ancestral language.

69
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.823
What's more,

70
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.950
we're not surprised to find that the number seven has a form with tea and not

71
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.991
with a k in that ancestral language and so our reconstruction of that root is

72
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.410
pretty straightforward.

73
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.540
The question becomes a bit more complicated when we look at ELLs and ours.

74
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.200
Take a look at the word for the number two and four,

75
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:46.201
the number three and the number eight in the Polynesian languages that we have

76
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:51.400
here.
Should the reconstructions of these languages have an l or an r?

77
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.500
One thing to notice here is that languages that have an l seemed to always have

78
00:04:56.501 --> 00:05:01.390
an l and languages that have an ar seem to always have an r and there's a good

79
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.980
distribution here,
so which one should we choose?
As I mentioned,

80
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:07.870
this isn't so straight forward.

81
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.430
What we'll need to do is to extend our comparison to other languages.

82
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.340
These languages aren't as closely related.

83
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.930
They'll give us some comparative evidence for the distribution of ls and rs

84
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.430
throughout the whole family.

85
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.080
You can see in these languages that l and R are distinct phonemes.

86
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.500
In other words,
l doesn't always show up when our does.

87
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.630
What's even more important is that these languages are consistent in their

88
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:36.040
distribution of Lnr,

89
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.360
so it's a reasonable to suppose that this distinction was also made in the

90
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:41.920
common ancestor language.

91
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.300
That's the parent of the Polynesian languages we're evaluating based on this

92
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:50.920
evidence will reconstruct the numbers two and three.
This way

93
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.250
we can then conclude that some of the daughter languages changed all instances

94
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.640
of ELLs and ours too.

95
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:03.641
Our and other daughter languages changed all instances of ELLs and ours to l.

96
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.640
When it comes to sound change,
there's a lot going on.

97
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.900
There are reasons for seeing typological characteristics.
In other words,

98
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.600
these types of sound changes tend to happen.

99
00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:23.580
These other ones don't or are less common so we have grounds for saying that the

100
00:06:23.581 --> 00:06:28.581
change from the phoneme f to the phoneme h is a common and expected one but we

101
00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:34.800
wouldn't expect h to turn into f and the same goes for V and.

102
00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:39.450
W.
We commonly expect a woman to turn into a like sound.

103
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.070
On top of that there are regular types of sound changes that happened in

104
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:48.240
languages and these are especially important for understanding language change.

105
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.380
If you'd like to take a look at those types of regular sound changes like

106
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:56.400
assimilation,
which I believe I've mentioned before in a previous lesson,

107
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.780
to get a more in depth understanding of assimilation dissimilation and things

108
00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:03.870
like metathesis,
compensatory lengthening and so on.

109
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.890
I put together a brief page with definitions and examples.

110
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.710
I'll leave you the URL for that page as well.

111
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.460
I really hope this lesson has been helpful for you.

112
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.760
I know it's a brief introduction,
but take a look at the site,

113
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.300
you'll get more information there and a couple of exercises as well.

114
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.950
Thanks for learning with me.
