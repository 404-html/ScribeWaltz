00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.650
performing the action.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.210
Pence is just an old French word.
That means time.

11
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.440
Consider another time,
another tents.
The past tense.

12
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.430
Latin verbs had a longer set of endings in the past.

13
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.430
I'm a sport you love,
but I'm,

14
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:44.431
are we Steve for you loved similarly a month versus I'm awaiting

15
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.980
but vulgar Latin shorten these endings.
A Masti Amato,

16
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.360
so Portuguese speakers say a mash to an Amato and Italian has I'm and Amato.

17
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.030
This tense gets called by other names.

18
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:07.810
past remote past in France,

19
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.400
Italy and Switzerland.

20
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.820
Romance speakers use a different way of talking about the past.

21
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.590
At least in everyday language.

22
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.310
They say the equivalent of you have sung for you saying so we hear national t

23

icon Tato yes,

24
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.790
they're important,
but let's revisit these constructions later.

25
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.690

Contrasty come thought fantastic.

29
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.330
Kentaro stay in the past tense for a moment,

30
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.490
but inject the concept of aspect.
Aspect is how we're,

31
00:02:57.491 --> 00:03:02.170
how often a verb is done.
It's the simple distinction or romance.

32
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.670
One time completed verbs versus continuous ongoing actions.

33
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.760
The difference between them becomes an issue.
In the past gone Tai Chi,
fantastic.

34
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.930
And other past forms are simple.
Pinpoint one time,
actions.

35

37

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.560
You're looking at I vulgar Latin,
Imperfect v day,

39
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.250
a bus [inaudible].

40
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.070
Many modern languages do lose that be at least in certain conjugations.

41
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.790
There's one more tense.
The future tense.

42
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.250
Western romance languages developed future endings by attacking the vulgar Latin

43
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:05.430
word for have to the backs of infinitives

44
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.330
Sardinian Romance.

45
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:17.980
Romanian and southern Italian languages didn't develop these future endings.

46
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.570
They didn't share in this innovation,

47
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.950
nor did they inherit the classical Latin future.
Instead,

48
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.630
they have phrases for the future as a Cantata,
they can

49
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.673
<v 0>data</v>

50
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.560
past,
present,
future three tenses.

51
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.390
You now have a basis for understanding how these three tenses is working,

52
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.233
romance,

53
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.290
as well as the difference between the [inaudible] and the imperfect in the
paths.
