MMM,

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.890
<v 1>hello and welcome to another course in native lane.com series of linguistics</v>

3
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:15.390
lessons for language learners.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.250
This time around we're going to look at how languages change over time as well

5
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.750
as how they're related to each other.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.850
There's something on the order of 6,000 languages spoken around the world

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.020
depending on how exactly we would define and count individual languages.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.520
That brings up a really good question.
How would we define language?

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.340
How would we define individual human languages?

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.200
That's actually a tough definition to give.
Here's one possible scenario.

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.140
Let's say that we have a speaker person,

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.550
one who comes into contact with another speaker person too,

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and speaker one is able to speak to person to and be understood by person too,

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.230
and the same goes in reverse.

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
Person two is able to speak with and be understood by person one.

16
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.960
In that case we have grounds for establishing mutual intelligibility.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.190
In other words,
the two people can speak with and understand each other,

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.910
and this is potentially something we might call a language.

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.560
They share a common language.

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.710
Now they also share a common language with the speaker three.

21
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:24.210
If person three comes meets speakers one and two and is able to speak with and

22
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:29.160
be understood by both all three of these people share a common language.

23
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.180
There's mutual intelligibility.
Now what if speakers one,

24
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.250
two and three visit a new area,

25
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:39.270
a new region where they can understand the people and be understood by the

26
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.020
people in this new region.
But the speech differs somewhat.

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.920
The speech of the people in this new region differs from the speech of speakers

28
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:50.430
one,
two and three in some notable way.
Well,

29
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.710
we would say that speakers one,

30
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:57.180
two and three and the speakers in this new region have differing dialects,

31
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.610
but the speech of these different speakers,

32
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:01.920
it doesn't just vary depending on the region.

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.280
It also varies depending on the social situation.

34
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.910
So we might find that all of these people,
speakers one,

35
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.540
two and three use a different form of their language when they're speaking at

36
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.290
home or at work or in an official capacity with say,

37
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.820
a government representative.

38
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.070
In all of these cases we find different registers and other words,

39
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.200
different social forms of the language.

40
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.650
There's also room for individual speech patterns,

41
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.330
and this would define an idiot elect.
This is on the personal individual level.

42
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.670
In all of these instances,

43
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.500
speakers still share mutual intelligibility and a common language.

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.790
So there's something like 6,000 of these languages spoken around the world.

45
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.290
These languages don't differ from each other at random.
Instead,

46
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.150
some languages are related to some other languages and unrelated to other

47
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.800
languages.
It works a lot like genetic relationships,

48
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.770
like family trees.
During the rest of this course,

49
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.510
we'll consider methods for comparing any two languages or multiple languages and

50
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:09.640
seeing how closely they're related to each other,

51
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.140
as well as how to look back in time to extend that relationship into the past

52
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.410
and consider how we would determine or even reconstruct the parent or ultimate

53
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.740
ancestor language.

54
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.940
So I hope you'll stick with me as we work through these next three lessons.

55
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.530
Learning how to use the historical comparative method to look back in time into

56
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.960
individual languages and language relatedness.
