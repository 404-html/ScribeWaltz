1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.910
Yeah.

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.840
<v 1>Dust off your time,</v>

3
00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:06.010
machines and sediment thousand years into the past when you get there,

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.480
grabbed the nearest English speaker.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.260
How can you tell they're the ones that sound like this?

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.280
Our phone or their therapist?
We'll do it our cabinet.

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.870
No hop back in and turn that dial 1000 years into the future.

8
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.330
What will future English be like?

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.313
<v 0>Huh?</v>

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.240
<v 1>Since most of us don't have time machines,</v>

11
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.510
how can we predict the future at all with fortune tellers and crystal balls or

12
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.560
maybe with physics,

13
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:45.610
which predicts that if a certain object travels a certain speed for a set amount

14
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:49.540
of time,
it will cover a certain distance.
No more,
no less.

15
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.700
Say your mom jumps in Zoomcar and tears away at 92 miles per hour for 15

16
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:57.040
minutes.
When we pull out a really,

17
00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.740
really long ruler to measure how far she's gone,

18
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.360
this equation predicts that she'll travel precisely 23 miles.

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.703
Great,

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.420
but where's the foolproof equation for predicting complex social things like

21
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:14.890
languages?
This isn't physics.
You say,
well,

22
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.300
are there at least trends?
Okay,
here's a possibility.

23
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.520
Complicated words with a lot of moving pieces often gets simpler over time.

24
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.050
It's not a rule,
but maybe we could find more of these patterns,

25
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.560
but it gets more complicated because our languages looking feel will depend on

26
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.350
the path it takes through future history.
I mean,

27
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:42.370
sometimes the single language branches out into a full family tree.

28
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.990
The progeny might differ suddenly from one town to the next or they might sound

29
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.670
totally different from each other.

30
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.820
We'll future English actually turn into an entire family,

31
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.720
but that family doesn't have to come from proper English.

32
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.950
Close your eyes and picture what English looks like to you.

33
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.320
Did you see this if your name's professor come through?

34
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:06.154
You sure did.

35
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.460
The people living in this inner circle think they speak the real English,

36
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.930
but future English could be an underdog champ from India or China or even inner

37
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:21.720
city slang,
dog,
remote islands,
jungles,

38
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.680
mountain villages.

39
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.720
These kinds of places are sometimes home to rare languages that are almost like

40
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:28.730
living fossils.
Well,

41
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.750
future English survive like a time capsule giving future scholars the chance

42
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.730
tomorrow hold.
Wow.

43
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.990
This remnant sounds almost as quaint and archaic is people did back in the year

44
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.991
2014 languages can take the middle road changing and not changing at the same

45
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:50.600
time.
It sounds weird at first,
but all it takes is a dash of dye.
Glossier,

46
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.890
meaning double tongues thanks to a uniform written Chinese.

47
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.500
A book from Beijing can be read in Hong Kong,

48
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.420
but when locals Beijing travel to Hong Kong,

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.020
they find themselves surrounded by a completely different language.

50
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.640
Real future English be like this seesawing between a rigid,

51
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.240
cohesive language and a patchwork of local languages.

52
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.900
Even stranger are creoles languages that almost come to life out of the bones of

53
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.300
other languages.
Tope piecing in Papa New Guinea snags.

54
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.220
Most of its words from English,

55
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.310
but you couldn't tell by listening to it.

56
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.810
It's still full of foreign features.
Seriously,

57
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.660
they have different words for talking to one person,
two people,

58
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.440
three people or a bunch of people,
but it crystallized future English.

59
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.190
Is that a bit extreme now?
We haven't even reached the extreme.

60
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.710
What have been the wake of some catastrophe?
Only three speakers remain.

61
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.070
Think of those last speakers out there,

62
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.360
or think of the loneliest man on earth,
wandering the Amazon.

63
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.480
Are these the last breaths of once great languages?
Meanwhile,

64
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.590
whichever path you chose,
the future of ZoomCar seems pretty set.

65
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.330
It'll just keep following this equation.
Speed goes up,
more distance covered,

66
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.650
but things could go many ways for future English.
Come on.

67
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:21.651
Imagine the Scifi utopias or dystopias or flat out normal Topia is we might find

68
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:22.854
ourselves in.

69
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.100
So perhaps what we'll become a future English is not too different than asking

70
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:30.210
what will become of future us.
