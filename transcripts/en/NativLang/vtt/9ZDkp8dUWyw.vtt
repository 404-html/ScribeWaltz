1
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.300
MMM.

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.380
<v 0>Meaning let's take a moment to make sense of meaning or at least see how other</v>

3
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:19.220
people do.
What kinds of things means something,

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.710
words.
We usually think those means something.

5
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.910
Signs.
Sure.
I'll give you that one.

6
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.340
Body language.
Okay.
Buildings.

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.810
I don't know about that one.
Rocks.

8
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.080
Again,
I don't really know about that.

9
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.110
Let's just focus on these things.

10
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.140
The ones we're comfortable saying means something.

11
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.400
What do they have in common as far as their meaning goes?

12
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.830
They all have some on the surface,
symbolic features,

13
00:00:56.831 --> 00:01:01.831
something that they are like a painted sign with this specific pattern.

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.950
A sequence of letters and arm with fingers held in a certain way,

15
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.760
but we also take them all to stand for something else.

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.010
Meaning is what makes this possible.
Do you use the traditional term?

17
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.530
We could call all of these signs.

18
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.570
Then we'd say that all of these signs stand for something and we call this

19
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:28.220
relationship meaning in linguistics,
semantics,

20
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.370
hashes out this relationship between words and phrases and their meanings.

21
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.860
Some quirks come up when you look at meaning and language.

22
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.280
One major one is fuzziness words don't necessarily have fixed independent

23
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:47.150
meanings.
Think of words like pizza,
cheese,

24
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.250
sauce,
bread.
We don't take these to mean the same thing,

25
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:56.030
but they all depend on each other in a way and each one encompasses a different

26
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.140
range of things for different people in different cuisines.

27
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.620
The form of a word and the meaning of a word don't match or parallel each other.

28
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.530
The relationship between them is mostly arbitrary.

29
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.920
There's nothing about the sound or shape of the English word cheese or for that

30
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:15.660
matter,

31
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.540
the Italian word format joke that inevitably link them to this meaning

32
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.290
meaning changes over time.

33
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.160
The old English word Sally meant fortunate,

34
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.760
but that word now pronounced silly means something quite different if you're

35
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.710
interested in meaning and the etymology of words.

36
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.180
Here's a video with more on meaning change.
Also,

37
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.220
context really matters for meaning and language and ambiguity lingers around

38
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.760
many corners.
If I tell you he turned red,

39
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.060
you can imagine a few possibilities.

40
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.650
This kind of issue brings the actions surrounding any bit of language to our

41
00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:58.484
attention.

42
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.590
Linguists have a term for this context that feeds the meaning of any piece of

43
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:07.330
language pragmatics.
That's the fancy term for the context.

44
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.770
Sensitivity of meaning.

45
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.430
Context isn't just important for recognizing the meaning of words the faces,

46
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.000
people make,
the tones,

47
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.010
somebody uses touch or body movement all communicates something about meaning.

48
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.290
Subtler features even come into play like how far or how close somebody is

49
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:29.230
standing to you,

50
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.700
which in the 1960s one anthropologist termed proxemics

51
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.010
escaping beyond immediate interactions with other humans.

52
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.840
We also think that physical signs and symbols have meanings.

53
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.740
I already admitted as much about this particular sign earlier,

54
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.600
gathering up all the different meaningful signs and studying how they work is

55
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:57.340
the business of semiotics.
Semantics in language,

56
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.980
semiotics in signs in general,

57
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.570
but enough of this name dropping meaning matters in logic too.

58
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
But here it's not so much about how context and communication impact meaning but

59
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.750
about the role.
Meaning plays in reasoning,
arguing and thinking.

60
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.760
I can take thoughts like she likes Tofu and he likes ice cream.

61
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.610
She likes ice cream and he likes to food.

62
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.430
She likes ice cream and he likes ice cream.

63
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.260
And I can reduce them to a common pattern.
X and y.

64
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.150
That pattern is the logical form we see in all three sentences.

65
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.150
Now the three of them don't mean the same thing.

66
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.320
Once we assign meanings to that bit of logic x and Y,

67
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.130
we get three sentences and we can tell if they're right or not.

68
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.260
Of course we do need to define some of the words.
Who is he?

69
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.340
Who is she?
What exactly counts as Tofu?

70
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.560
How would we know that they like it?
Here the focus is on defining words,

71
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.940
clarifying meaning and avoiding pitfalls like using vague language to arrive at

72
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:08.500
a false conclusion.
As long as I'm asking questions,

73
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:12.640
here are some more general ones looking at the images from before.

74
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.010
I thought of these ones as meaningful.

75
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.190
Is that a property they have outside of my head?

76
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.880
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

77
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.400
<v 0>Is the meaning just inside my head?</v>

78
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.180
What's the role of my psychology and determining meaning.

79
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.180
<v 0>Similarly,
our meanings tied to real things in the world around us.</v>

81
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.300
Are they just tied to ideas in our mind?

82
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.810
Is the meaning part of our thoughts?
A separate component,

83
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:42.950
like logic suggests somehow different from the structure of our thoughts.

84
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.323
<v 2>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.650
<v 0>Do the best dictionaries tell us what words actually mean or do the merely</v>

86
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:53.670
document how words are being used?
What about common sense?

87
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:56.670
The feeling of shared meaning across the group of people?

88
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.860
Does it have any role in meaning?
Do Meanings Exist?

89
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.590
If so,
where?
What are they made of for things to mean?

90
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.830
Does meaning itself have to mean?
If so,
how does it,

91
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.290
these and other deceptively simple questions get us thinking about the issues

92
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:20.030
that the philosophy of language takes up when it comes to meeting.
Well,

93
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.590
we can keep going,
meaning matters in a variety of subjects,
in studies,

94
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.700
but I just wanted to leave you with an idea of how meaning is approached to

95
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.390
compliment my other videos and linguistics and logic and language learning.

96
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.790
As always,
thanks for learning.
