1
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.463
Hey,

2
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.070
<v 2>each Latin down had many different forms.</v>

3
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.550
<v 3>The accusative singular became the basic four</v>

4
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.240
<v 2>vulgar.
Latin boodle meant wall cost.</v>

5
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.760
Summit House silent meant salt and update late art.

6
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.010
<v 3>Every Latin Noun belong to one of three categories.
Masculine,</v>

7
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.150
feminine,
and Neuter.
These categories are called genders,

8
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.720
but they don't necessarily correspond to physical gender.

9
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.640
Many words for inanimate objects where masculine or feminine and some words for

10
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.000
people were actually nuder.
Yeah,

11
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.530
romance content.
Words have a stem in an ending here.
Ooh,

12
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.840
AH,
eh.
Are Endings masculine or neuter?
Ooh,
feminine.

13
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.853
Ah,

14
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.610
any gender can in a vulgar Latin combined masculine and neuter.

15
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.560
Ooh,
into a single masculine gender.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So masculine Moodle and neuter vegetable both become masculine and the romance

17
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.970
languages.
Cost size,
feminine,
solid stays,

18
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:12.100
masculine and feminine

19
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.620
in Mediterranean Romance Languages,
masculine nouns and an or.
Ooh,

20
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.060
these are the modern languages.
Spanish,
Moodle,
Sardinian,
Moodle,

21
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.790
Italian Moodle,
Portuguese,
Moodle from late Latin Moodle

22
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.950
in eastern Spain,
France,
Switzerland,
northern Italy.
In Romania,

23
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.580
this masculine ending actually wears off,
so we get French move.

24
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.350
Romanian mood,
romantic meat.

25
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.960
You can see that the original ending Ou has been lost.

26
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.680
Feminine Nouns in,
Ah,
keep that buy in Iberia.

27
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.200
It'll lead southern France and Switzerland.

28
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.260
So Petra becomes Spanish.

29
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.280
Pierre Ground Italian Pietro Sardinian Pedram feminine,

30
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.100
uh,
gets and Catalan,
Romanian and Portuguese Pedram Piatra.

31
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.810
It has a sound like instead of
French,

32
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.280
eventually just loses this feminine.
Pierre

33
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.170
final also gets weaker outside of Italy.

34
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.640
So we have Italian at day camp at Annie's Sardinian rt,

35
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.400
but romance or French

36
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.900
<v 2>or Italian silent,
but Spanish Sal French Sen</v>

37
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.480
neuters remain in Romanian and a few curious cases in Italian and Romansh.

38
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.000
Romanian neuters have a masculine looking form in the singular but feminine life

39
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:49.500
forms in the plural.
So neuter vegetable becomes Romanian veteran,

40
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.880
but the plural is vetter bay.

41
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.630
There's an east west split in the way.

42
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:05.631
Romance languages turn basic nouns like Moodle and two plurals western romance

43
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:09.090
languages like French,
Spanish,
Occitan,

44
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.510
Portuguese and Sardinian add an s to the end.

45
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.380
This comes from the accusative plural in Latin Moodle has the accusative plural

46
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:23.610
Moodle's,
which you can see in the Sardinian Moodle's,
Spanish Moodle's,

47
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.560
Katelyn Mousse and French Mu.
Similarly,

48
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.070
the accusative plural of Casa Casa.

49
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.410
So Spanish cost,
Katelyn cassis and so on.

50
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.200
Eastern Romance languages lean on the nominative plural instead,

51
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.600
which is responsible for all those academic sounding Latin plurals in English

52
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.510
alumnus,
alumni,
alumna alumnae.

53
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.980
Those are the same plurals that survive in eastern romance languages like

54
00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:03.960
Italian,
Sicilian and Romanian Moodle has the plural,
moody,

55
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.990
just as Italian Moodle becomes moody and Romanian mood has the plural mood

56
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.770
at a glance.

57
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.210
It looks like eastern romance also owes its feminine plurals to the Latin

58
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:22.510
nominative.
Latin Casa has a nominative plural Casa,

59
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.660
which should become romance Cassie,
but evidence points to an accusative origin.

60
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.420
Eastern Romance.
Last final ss.

61
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.520
So gases eventually changed to Italian Cozzie and Romanian Kasey.

62
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

63
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.880
<v 2>What about the plurals of those nouns?</v>

64
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:45.881
Ending in a nounce in the west still add s so we have Brazilian,

65
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:49.130
Portuguese,
acci and after cheese,

66
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.020
those vowels switching eastern nounce turn that a two,
n.

67
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.940
E.
R.
T.

68
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.480
That's all for the basics of masculine,

69
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.450
feminine and Neuter Gender and singular and plural.

70
00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:06.540
Number of nouns in the romance languages.
