<v 0>You've made it to the last lesson in native link.com series on using the IPA to</v>

3
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.620
pronounce another language.

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.520
This time I'm going to build on the previous videos that introduced vowels,

5
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.840
consonants and syllables and move on to features that apply to longer units of

6
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.540
speech.
First off,

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.860
it's important to consider that when we record speech or listened to speech,

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.810
we don't actually find things like breaks between words or pauses between

9
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:43.710
sentences.
We don't hear punctuation or capital letters.

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
Instead we hear very fluid stream of sounds.

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.240
There's a linguistic term for that stream of sounds.
An utterance.

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.360
An utterance is a chunk of spoken language.

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.780
The concept of utterances focuses on speech instead of squeezing spoken language

14
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.410
into categories proper to written language like words and sentences and

15
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:08.730
paragraphs.
This plays into phonetic transcriptions.
In Ipa.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.510
We don't need to use things like punctuation marks,

17
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.030
word breaks or line breaks in IPA.

18
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.230
That also leads to another observation about speech.

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.300
Speakers don't make a clear divisions between sounds between the individual

20
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.190
phonemes when they're spoken out loud.

21
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.090
Phonemes that are pronounced next to each other tend to become more alike.

22
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.000
This is a process known as assimilation.

23
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
Here's an example of a simulation with the phoneme n.

24
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.510
The N in the word lane has the alveolar nasal mm,

25
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.530
but the n in language has the Vilar nasal

26
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.420
notice that comes before the [inaudible] stop.

27
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.430
This n has assimilated to the Vilar sound that comes after it.

28
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.390
I'm telling you that and are two different sounds in the words lane and

29
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.640
language.
However,
if you're an English speaker,

30
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:10.641
you probably think that these two sounds are simply versions of the same sound.

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.270
They're both n sounds.
This points to an abstract concept.

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.540
The concept of aloe phones versus underlying phonemes and these examples mm and

33
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.680
mm are two allophones of the same underlying phony.

34
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.380
The abstract phoneme is n,

35
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.550
but it's realized in different contexts by different allophones.

36
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.070
Allophone is a Greek word for other sound and that's really the way that a

37
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:42.660
speaker of a language here's different sounds as versions of the same sound.

38
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.910
We can visually distinguish phonemes from allophones in IPA by enclosed AME

39
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:50.010
closing allophones in brackets.

40
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.630
These two sounds and close to in brackets are different allophones of that same

41
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:59.631
phoneme and speech isn't just phonemes strung together into syllables and

42
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.100
utterances.
There are other features.

43
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.270
One other feature is known as accent stress.

44
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.680
Accent involves saying one syllable of a word louder than the surrounding

45
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.850
syllables.
We do this in English with words that have a fixed accent.

46
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.640
For instance,
in the word hotel,

47
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.530
the second syllable is pronounced louder than the first.
On the other hand,

48
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.580
in the word hostel,
the first syllable is louder than the second.

49
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.500
So in hotel,
the second syllable is given a stress accent.

50
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.480
It's weighted stress.
Accident is indicated in Ipa by a small,

51
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.900
straight apostrophe before the stressed syllable like this.

52
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.630
Notice that the syllable breaks,

53
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.600
symbolist dropped when the stress accent is added.

54
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.920
Words can have a pitch accent instead.
In some languages,

55
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.020
pitch involves raising or lowering the tone as in music.
For instance,

56
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:00.790
the ancient Greek word out toss as a high pitch on the last syllable.
Well,

57
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.450
the word [inaudible] has a high pitch on the first syllable.

58
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.470
The other syllables have a lower pitch where it's can be distinguished that way.

59
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.740
We can represent basic pitch changes in Ipa with an acute accent above high tone

60
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.010
valves and a grave accent above low tone valves.

61
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.580
We've been applying these features at the level of syllables and words.

62
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.440
What if we apply those features like languages routinely due to the level of

63
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.860
utterances in sentences?
When we get to that level,

64
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.920
we can see that we use stress in English to differentiate.

65
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.660
I didn't go versus I didn't go versus I didn't go.

66
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.250
I'm using stress to convey emphasis or to nuance the meaning.

67
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.450
We can consider intonation.
Similarly,
English speakers,

68
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.260
regular leaves intonation at the level of a sentence to ask a question.

69
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.190
You raise your voice at the end of a sentence to ask a question,

70
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.840
right and intonation lowers at the end of a typical statement.

71
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.130
I've just given you examples of prosody,

72
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.930
the application of features like intonation and stress at the level of an entire

73
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.931
phrase or an entire utterance rather than at the level of a single phoneme or a

74
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:20.490
single syllable.
I've now covered the basics of fouls,

75
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.430
consonants,
syllables and prosody.

76
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.390
You can start to use your understanding of the IPA as you learn languages.

77
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.280
Check out the web page or workbook from our practice and move on to the intro to

78
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.550
phonology for a deeper understanding of how pronunciation works.

79
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.660
All the best on your journeys with IPA.
And thanks for learning with me.
