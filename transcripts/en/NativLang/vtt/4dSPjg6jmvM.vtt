00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.493
Oh,

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.230
<v 0>welcome to the grammar of words.</v>

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.670
This is one of a number of linguistics lessons on the site and it will introduce

4
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:18.410
you to how language is build words.
We'll cover two basic topics in this lesson.

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.470
The first is going to be the components of words,

6
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:25.910
and the second will be a way to classify types of languages based on how they do

7
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:28.910
build words.
Two concepts to get you started.

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.250
The first is the morphine.

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.520
This is our basic building block in the grammar of words.

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.580
A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit.

11
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:42.320
You can break a word down into each word has at least one morpheme,

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.090
so for instance,
the word dog is both a word and a morpheme.

13
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.070
It's the single morphine dog.

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.700
If you just break it down to the sound or the gusts sound,

15
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:57.560
you're no longer working with morphine's.
There were dogs in the plural.

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.380
More than one dog has to morphemes.

17
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.500
It has the morphine dog and it has a sound or a sound that tells you it's the

18
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:09.560
plural,
the morphine dog and the morphine plural.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.620
Make the word dogs,
which has two morphine's.

20
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.500
A second concept to get you started is an Alan Moore and Ella morph is a

21
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.050
different way.
The same morpheme can show up.

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.450
We talk about morphemes as being a general underlying concept.

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.760
I gave you the example of dog with s and s oral morphine.

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.060
You can see that it makes the word plural.

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.510
If we had that same plural s to another word,

26
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.190
we sometimes see that it shows up differently.
For example,
in the word hats,

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
it shows up as an s sound and not as sound.

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.640
So the z sound in the s sound are two Allen morphs of a single plural as

29
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.533
morphine.

30
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
There are different types of morphine's there morphemes that can stand on their

31
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:59.730
own,
like the word dog.
These are known as free morphemes.

32
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.710
It doesn't have to be attached to another morpheme to be used morphemes that do

33
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.520
need to be attached to another morpheme to be used or known as bound.
Morphemes.

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.770
Take the example of plural s.
Do you ever say just s on its own domain?

35
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:15.360
Plural,
plural.

36
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:20.340
S always shows up at the end of other morphemes like in dogs that makes it a

37
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.210
bound morphine.

38
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.160
Two types of bound morphemes occur in English and a variety of other languages.

39
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.830
Derivational,
morphemes and inflectional.

40
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:32.580
Morphine's derivational morphemes allow you to form new words,

41
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:37.581
new concepts out of other morphemes inflectional morphemes conveyed grammatical

42
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.424
information.

43
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.660
An example would be the s in the word dogs that we've already talked about a few

44
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:47.520
times that conveys the grammatical information.
Hey,
this words plural,

45
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.160
so keep an eye out for both of these types.

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.570
Bound morphemes are generally bound in a fixed position with respect to the

47
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:55.080
morphine's.

48
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.930
They're attaching to morphemes that attach before another morpheme are known as

49
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.950
prefixes morphemes that occur after another.
Morpheme are known as suffixes.

50
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.620
There are other examples that actually occur inside of it,

51
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.621
either morphine that are called in fixes and bound morphemes that attach around

52
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.630
another morphine,
which we call circum fixes.

53
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.810
I guess you can say that these are a little more exotic.

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.780
All of these are known as affixes,

55
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.290
which is the Latin way of saying that they're attached to another word.

56
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.330
Languages have other techniques at their disposal for expressing grammatical

57
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:35.380
concepts.
One of these is a clinic which is kind of like a free morphine,

58
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.670
kind of like an ethics.

59
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.710
It sits alongside of and is pronounced along with the word that it grammatically

60
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.711
relates to a zero morpheme or a non morpheme is a morphine that doesn't get

61
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:52.300
pronounced.
This concept of US silent,
meaningful unit is strange at first.

62
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.410
I know we can argue for its existence based on the grammar of a language,

63
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.430
so knowing that English speakers differentiate between singular and plural,

64
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.690
it could be argued that dog actually carries a zero morphine.

65
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.520
So these two morphemes,

66
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.550
the free morpheme dog and the bound morpheme zero morpheme allow us to identify

67
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:16.690
the categories.
Singular Noun.
It's one dog and not multiple dogs.

68
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.140
Another fundamental concept is peripheral basis,

69
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.550
which uses multiple words to express the same grammatical concept that another

70
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.520
language might express using an inflection on morphine.

71
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.220
There's also compounding,

72
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.050
which takes two free morphemes and sets them side by side to represent a new

73
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.670
concept.
In that way.

74
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:40.210
It's kind of like attaching a derivational morpheme in a language that allows
it,

75
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.110
but the two morphemes are free.
So we can say for instance,

76
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.130
Dog House Dog House,

77
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.860
which attaches the free morpheme dog and the free morpheme house to come up with

78
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:51.760
a new concept.

79
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.740
Rearranging word order is also a useful technique that's very common for

80
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.790
expressing grammar.

81
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.030
We have some additional terminology for talking about languages that like to

82
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:08.830
bind morphine's.
The root morpheme is the base that carries most of the meaning.

83
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.020
Any derivational morphemes added to the root would help form the stem to which

84
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.720
affix is can be added inflectional.

85
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.980
Affixes would not be part of the stem and he derivational affixes.
However,

86
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.660
and the route itself would be part of the stem and if it's on its own,

87
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:30.661
it's both the root and the stem languages that tend to use bound morphemes are

88
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:35.380
known as synthetic languages because they tend to put morphemes together to form

89
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:38.020
words at the other end of the spectrum.

90
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.100
And analytic language does not use bound morphine.

91
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.650
So each word on average in an analytic languages of free morphine types of

92
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:51.910
languages that use bound morphemes include fusional languages,
which are rarer,

93
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.220
but basically fuse together information,

94
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.760
grammatical information into an inflection Atticus's.

95
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.120
So they tend to have a lot more meaning in their affixes and fewer affixes,

96
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.170
whereas a gluten native languages tend to have more affixes,

97
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.640
but less overlap between grammatical meanings in each individual athletes.

98
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.290
This lesson has covered morphine's,
Alan morphs,

99
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.070
and very roughly how different individual languages build outwards with

100
00:06:20.071 --> 00:06:20.904
morphine's.

101
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.840
Be sure to check out the page for more information and exercises and I'll catch

102
00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:25.620
you in the next lesson.
