00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.800
Writing Japanese.
It's hard.
I know what you're thinking.
Dot.
Josh.
It's Japan.

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.490
When they go in,
they go all in,
but it's worse than you think.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.130
It's ridiculously,
ridiculously hard.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.330
Growing up,
I was a language not looking at me making this video,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.300
guess I still am.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.840
Through the years I spent time learning this script and these scripts and these

7
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.860
ones as some time learning this and even more with,
all right,
you get it.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.330
And then I went for Japanese.
See in the u s there's this fluid that goes around.

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.780
It's called Japan affilia catch it and you're off reading Manga,

10
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:41.010
watching anime and eating the kind of Sushi with the fish.
That's all in the top.

11
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.130
Like I was committed though.

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.860
I had it for the library and straight to the Japanese books.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.350
This was back when the new library was being built,

14
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.800
so they were holding books hostage in this dingy place with no AC.

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.950
The books are all shuffled around down on these low shelves.

16
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.890
You know the ones that are like below your knee level on the ground.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
So I do my Ninja band and I scanned the area for resources.

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.430
Fluffy book about Japanese is for everybody.

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.560
Pass easy Japanese in five seconds a day pass cartoon cat.

20
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
Yay.
By the way,
you'll learn some Japanese,
I promise,
double pass.

21
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.060
But then there it was the biggest,
the heaviest,

22
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.570
the densest textbook in the entire section.
Modern Japanese book,

23
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:25.830
one grammar lessons.
It called my name,
it said the Shul.

24
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.630
So I rush home,
I bust open the book and it hits me with syllables.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
My first thoughts are while the optimist in me comes out and says,
oh,

26
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:39.060
these look so fun and Japanesey,
but guess what?
The pessimist in me said,

27
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.940
that's like 76 more symbols than I want to memorize.
You know,

28
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.540
the pessimists inside me as an owner who is that fast counter,

29
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.570
the optimist one out and for good reason,

30
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.060
it was actually less of a hassle than it looked like at first.

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.830
Just 46 characters in total on account of some of the syllables turned out to be

32
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.250
duplicative with two little voicing slashies added to their heads even better.

33
00:01:59.251 --> 00:01:59.731
I was told,

34
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:03.150
this is technically all I needed to know to write every Japanese sound.

35
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.020
That's all the syllables the language has thanks to Japanese being all neat and

36
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.910
orderly in the way it lays out syllables.

37
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
And that's great until I find out that the friendlies syllables are lies.

38
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.470
Like when the t plus East syllable is actually ci,

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.270
and then the t plus you syllable is sue or when this,
this,

40
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.430
and this actually sound like that,

41
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.350
that end that the more I read,
the more Japanese was saying,
but wait,

42
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.160
there's more,
more compounds,
syllables,
more double consonants,

43
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.690
more historical syllables.

44
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.720
They were hiding from me and just forgot to mention Asteris mark all over the

45
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.350
place.
But Hey,
historical spelling and complicated work arounds.

46
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.900
I come from English baby and that's how we write.

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.980
Plus I just did a whole rant on Tibetans so I can handle some clunky syllables

48
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.980
besides compared to a Japanese syllables east to be written.

49
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:54.570
It's all super regular.
So that's a relief without giving me time to breathe.

50
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.340
They tell me that for each one of these syllables,

51
00:02:56.341 --> 00:03:01.100
I'm actually going to have to learn to characters.
Yes,
Japanese has two syllabi.

52
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:01.810
Aries.

53
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
The one I spent hours sweating over was these are the same syllables written in,

54
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.030
so our Hiragana and Katakana for writing different sounds.
Nope.

55
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.840
The silhouette is don't do anything different than when do I use this one or

56
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.860
that one.
Oh,

57
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.440
just keep in mind that they're used for different syllables in different

58
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:24.670
contexts.
Japanese is very context sensitive after all smile,

59
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.580
but none of that is what makes Japanese tough.

60
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.750
It's when they introduced yet another mixed in script that things start getting

61
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.390
serious.
I mean seriously serious.

62
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.780
Roll the clocks back to the day Japan learn to write.

63
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.830
They learned it from China and learning to write from Chinaman memorizing

64
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.190
thousands of characters just to read the basics.
Yeah.

65
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.090
Well unlike other places that learn their penmanship skills from that formidable

66
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.340
cultural powerhouse,
that was the middle kingdom.

67
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.750
Japan held on to it's long master list of Chinese characters.
Oh,

68
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:57.400
they held onto it real tight.

69
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.850
They're called [inaudible] and they're the backbone of Japanese.

70
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.250
Even though syllabary is,

71
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:05.830
I was learning came from simplified versions of some of these characters.

72
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.660
At first they pass this Kanji stuff off as a third native system.

73
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.840
You know you've got your Hiragana Katakana,
your Kanji,

74
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.660
and instead of different characters for different syllables.

75
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.420
These are just different characters for different words,
you know,

76
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:21.490
like how you learned to say new vocabulary.

77
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:23.880
When you're learning other languages with Kanji,

78
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.390
you get to learn to draw your new vocabulary too.
So exciting.

79
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.830
That's what I learned about a dictionary with more than 50,000 characters to

80
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.440
play with.
That's a lot of characters.

81
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.730
I think it was maybe more of a mind game to make me okay with what came next.

82
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.670
Don't worry.
I was told you could do.
All right.

83
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:46.750
Reading Basic Japanese if you just learned a couple thousand characters.

84
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.150
Oh,
oh,
just a couple of thousand I guess I was supposed to say.
Oh,

85
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.710
50 thousands a lot.
In that case,
2000 should be a walk in the Zen Garden are,

86
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.980
are you not supposed to walk in those comb through the Zen Garden?

87
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.700
Maybe they even downgraded me again,
telling me I can pat myself on that

88
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.730
<v 1>back for just mastering the basics.</v>

89
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:08.880
If I made it through the first 1,006 characters,

90
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.430
1,006 yeah,
this was slow.
It was time consuming.

91
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.620
They started me with these systems,
simple

92
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 0>real world examples like trees,</v>

93
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:22.170
suns and moons and they looked off,

94
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.530
but if you squint your eyes you could see it,
but it was more trickery.

95
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.760
After a couple hundred it started to be really clear that most Kaji aren't

96
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:33.390
drawings of the words I was learning at all.
No Way.

97
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.140
It took me awhile,
but I figured out what was going on there.

98
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.680
Like playing charades with somebody who has a very specific word in mind but

99
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:45.210
refuses to give you any good hints and clues you do get are like way out of
date,

100
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.930
like one word.
Something to do with trees.
Okay.

101
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.490
Sounds like or got it.
Nobody,
nobody.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.800
The answer was table.
See the thing you missed was that or sounds board,

103
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.490
which is an old word for table obviously.
Yeah.

104
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:05.270
Most Kanji or this kind of strange combination of a sounds like peace with the

105
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.080
something to do with peace except that the sounds like might not sound like the

106
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:11.670
thing it's supposed to sound like and it's something to do with can have

107
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.320
absolutely nothing logically to do with what the character means.

108
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.950
It's no good waving these complexities aside by saying that,
well,

109
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.060
it's a lot to learn,

110
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.540
but at least you're fundamentally just learning a character for each basic word.

111
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.020
For one,
a single character might mean a bunch of different things.

112
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.090
When it combos with other characters,

113
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.610
it can even mean a bunch of different things on its own.

114
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.590
Even worst for beginners though,

115
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.620
there's more than one way to pronounce almost every single one of these

116
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:40.640
characters.
Japanese is very context sensitive.
After all,

117
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.210
wink smile and that is the problem with Kanji.

118
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.350
They aren't just [inaudible].
There are a bunch of problems all mixed together.

119
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.300
It's the most bizarrely complicated writing system within a system ever devised

120
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:58.301
by humankind and next time I'll show you exactly what it was about Kanji that

121
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.110
really pushed me over the edge.

122
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.890
I like having you here spending some time with me thinking about the world's

123
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.760
toughest writing system.
Stick around and subscribe for language.
