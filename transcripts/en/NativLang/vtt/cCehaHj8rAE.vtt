1
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.440
Latin American Spanish.

2
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.330
Rewind a bit to the concept of complimentary distribution where different

3
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.450
allophones of a phoneme sharp in different contexts.

4
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.340
I used the word context to give you an indication of the surrounding phonemes.

5
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.870
The other sounds that surround that allophone the normal term for that is an

6
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.350
environment sounds don't exist on their own.

7
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.690
They exist in a specific environment.

8
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.990
Sometimes that environment changes the sound.

9
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.400
Here are some examples of complimentary distribution.
It's Spanish

10
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.350
embodies in Britannia and Korea in Granbury,

11
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:54.730
Tanya and Hispana.

12
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.960
Yan done no,

13
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.390
so we see three different allophones of a single phoneme en one,

14
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.910
one and one.

15
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.740
We can account for these allophones by discussing their environments.

16
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.040
We can say that occurs between an e and a p or between an e and a B.

17
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.460
We can say that the ng sound occurs between e and K or e and g and we see just

18
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:29.800
the plain end sound between any two vowels or at the beginning of a word or at

19
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:30.634
the end of a word.

20
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.230
This gives us some understanding of how and when to reproduce these allophones

21
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:36.790
in complementary distribution,

22
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.470
but then we can move on to make more concise generalizations using our

23
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:42.940
understanding of phonetics.

24
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.570
P and B are both bilabial plosives.

25
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.930
We can say that the phoneme and shows up as em before a bilabial plosive p as a

26
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:55.870
voiceless bilabial Plos it and be as a voiced by labial plosive.

27
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.070
Similarly,
Co and gut are both Vilar plosives.

28
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.170
We can say that n shows up as that sound before a Vilar plosive,

29
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.820
whether it's the voice to Vilar,

30
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:11.821
plosive gut or the voiceless cut and then it seems to show up as n anywhere

31
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:16.900
else.
So between bells or before or after silence.
In other words,

32
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:18.550
at the beginning or end of a word,

33
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.050
now that you've gained more intelligent appreciation for the environments where

34
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:25.360
the allophones of and show up in Spanish,

35
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.630
you can move to creating a rule that describes how one sound becomes another

36
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:32.530
sound in those environments.

37
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.900
So we can say that end becomes an m sound between a vowel and a bilabial

38
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:41.380
plosive.
We noticed that in our examples,

39
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.650
we would write such a rule like this and becomes em in the environment where it

40
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:52.300
is proceeded by a val and followed by a consonant with the features bilabial and

41
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.180
plosive,
which can be voiced or voiceless.
As we saw,

42
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.880
we look for other words where the phoneme and would show up between a vowel in a

43
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.980
bilabial plosive to check this rule.

44
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.220
What we'll find is that the rule holds,

45
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.720
but we'll also try to find counter examples that would force us to modify this

46
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.370
rule for the sake of accuracy.

47
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.380
One such counter example would be if the phoneme end ever shows up as an em

48
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:22.381
before a sound that is not a bilabial or a plosive unfortunately will eventually

49
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:25.780
run into examples that break the rule in just that way.

50
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.220
Aim Franzia seems to follow our rule except that the sound following the

51
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.530
allophone m of the phoneme and is not a bilabial implosive.

52
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.870
It's a lay Beal dental fricative.

53
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.650
So we need to find a way to strengthen our first notice that both fricatives and

54
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.760
plosives are obstructs,

55
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.870
meaning that you highly restrict the airflow when you make them.
Also,

56
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.390
both labial dentals and by labels are labels,

57
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.380
sounds so named because they involve the lips.

58
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.420
What if we broaden a rule a bit?

59
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.200
The rewritten rule would look like this and becomes an the environment where it

60
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.900
is proceeded by a val and followed by a label opstream.

61
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.130
There you have a strong rule that seems to apply throughout Spanish.

62
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.440
I hope you now have a better understanding of rules and environments and the

63
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.670
basics of phonology

64
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.310
