00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.790
Welcome to more logic at planned to make this the last installment in my brief

2
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:15.520
introduction to using logic as a way of looking at language.

3
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.670
If you haven't gone through the previous videos one through four,

4
00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:22.120
please take time to do so.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for you.

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.200
<v 1>Before getting into the new topics and wouldn't offer a brief note on</v>

7
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.370
translating into logic,

8
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.300
I realized that I never took the time to break translations into a step by step

9
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:32.134
process.

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.370
Now it's a good time to slow the pace down a bit and work through how to parse

11
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:38.650
ordinary language in logical language.

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.660
Then translate that logical language into symbolic logic.
First,

13
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:46.330
make sure you understand the logic of the sentence you're analyzing.

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.440
If your sentences English as a tough language,
break it down.

15
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.680
You're actually saying that English is tough and that English is the language.

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.940
Similarly,
a good person is somebody who is both good and a person.

17
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.800
Then break the translation has stages.
First,
reword the sentence.

18
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.440
In logical language,
English is a tough language,

19
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:08.290
becomes English as tough and English is the language.

20
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.980
Once you've structured it clearly start putting the sentence into logic.

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.060
Figure out how many variables you have and where to use them for all x.

22
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.900
If x is English,
then x is tough and x lane,
which was a good example.

23
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.940
As you go through this process,

24
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.941
look for buzzwords you've learned logical operators for if then if an Olif and

25
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.980
or and so on,
figure out where those go.

26
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.870
Also pick out universal in existential terms always in any time mean for all

27
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:38.470
times.
Somewhere is for some place and so on.

28
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.220
So the logic of everybody's talking to everybody else's more transparent.

29
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:45.970
Once it's reworded,
all persons are talking to all other persons.

30
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.690
It's just a step from there to for all eggs,

31
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.860
for all y if x is a person and why as a person.
The next is talking to y.

32
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.870
Now I fully realized that just throwing three or four heuristics out your way

33
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:02.810
isn't going to help you translate in detail into logic.

34
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.500
So I'm going to offer a few links in the info bar below that should provide you

35
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.470
with further exercises and more information on this topic

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.290
onto the new stuff.

37
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.370
I mentioned the domain of discourse when talking about variables,

38
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.450
I said that it was the set of all things a variable could represent.

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.960
That brings up two concepts we haven't covered yet.

40
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.950
A set and members of a set in logic,
uh,

41
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.860
said is just a grouping of things that belong together.

42
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.760
There's a set of colors of paint,
a set of ingredients and ice cream,

43
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.710
a set of people whose company you enjoy.

44
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.920
Those things within that set arts members,

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.660
members of the set of ingredients in ice cream include eggs,
cream and sugar.

46
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.350
If something a is an element of set a,

47
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.570
it's re it's represented this way.

48
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.650
So eggs are an element of the set ice cream ingredients.

49
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.400
We can also say that some B is not an element of a,
for example,

50
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.820
mutton is not an element of the set of ice cream ingredients,

51
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.740
but consider that some members of ice cream ingredients are also members of the

52
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.520
set of dairy products.
So the two sets intersect each other.

53
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.820
Ice Cream ingredients intersects dairy products.

54
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.190
That's the intersection of the two sets.

55
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.670
You can also speak of the union of the two sets.

56
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.170
This is the same concept underpinning logical or the Union of ice cream

57
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.950
ingredients in dairy products includes every member of both sets.

58
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.450
Let's get a little more detailed here.
There aren't simply sets.

59
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.190
Sets may have subsets,
so ice cream ingredients are a subset of foods,

60
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
but what we really mean by this is that ice cream ingredients and foods are two

61
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.110
different sets,
so it's even more precise to call ice cream ingredients,

62
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:49.480
a proper subset of the set of foods.

63
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.840
Of course two sets can also coincide.

64
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.800
The set of ice cream ingredients may be exactly the same as the set of

65
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.780
ingredients for something I've never heard of before,

66
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.780
in which case every member of one would be a member of the other.

67
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.900
Switching gears here to profitability,

68
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.770
I'm not going to look at solving problems in probability.

69
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.160
This is just about the the logic,
the language of probability.

70
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.990
All right,
keep the concepts you just learned about for sets in mind here,

71
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.630
the probability of a single event a is represented as the probability of a,

72
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.410
a separate event,
B as a probability be.

73
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.960
Now think back to our sets,

74
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.500
taking both the probability of a or the probability of B and that's a logical or

75
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:40.051
there you'll have the probability of the Union of a and B and you can bring back

76
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.540
the concept of intersection to here.

77
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:48.310
It's the probability of both a and B being true.
Now,

78
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:52.180
if you think that the probability of event a depends on event B,

79
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.230
you'll talk about the probability of a on B.
Likewise,

80
00:04:56.231 --> 00:05:00.790
if the probability of B depends on a,
then that's the probability of beyond a,

81
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.400
as I mentioned,

82
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.730
this is all well and good for the probably the language of probability,

83
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:10.090
but if you want to calculate probabilities you'll need more information than the

84
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.580
symbols I've just given you.
Well,

85
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.610
those are all the topics I have to cover in this quick run through the basics of

86
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.810
using logic as a way for understanding language.
Of course,

87
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.810
logic covers so many subjects and has so many uses that I haven't even touched

88
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:23.710
on in these videos.

89
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.180
It's heavily influenced many fields where the mathematics philosophy,

90
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:33.181
computer science and more but crucial to those studies is logical validity.

91
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.331
Instead,

92
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:37.420
the heart of this course has been the use of logic to understand sentences,

93
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:38.254
language.

94
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.980
I hope this short introduction to form a logic will help me take a structure to

95
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.250
look at language and provide you with a good jumping off point for learning
more.

96
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.480
As always,
I appreciate your time and thank you for learning with me.
