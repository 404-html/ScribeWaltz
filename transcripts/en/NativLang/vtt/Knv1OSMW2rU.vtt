1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.380
Do you swear like a sailor?
Are you running low on bad words?
Well,

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:06.510
have I got a destination for your bucket list?

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.810
An island where every word can be a curse word.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.210
It's vacation time this year.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.440
Forget old cathedrals or skyscraper city scapes.
You want a real adventure.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
So you strapped together and outrigger meticulously following ancient oceanic

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:28.110
craftsmanship and you set sail straight to the middle of who knows where in the

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.740
South Pacific,
the place you land might be.
Who knows where to you?

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.420
To the locals,
it's my [inaudible],
one of the Solomon Islands.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.010
You reach into your back pocket for that soggy South Seas.

11
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.760
Phrasebook you hold along with you,
but your sprinkles of French Tahitian,

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.910
Tongan and Samoan earning you nothing but blank stares.

13
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.310
But a clever people know exactly what to do when words fail.
Point and grunt,

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.250
nonverbal communication within a day.

15
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.300
You've mastered basic words for delicacies like pig guts,
mm.

16
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.740
And words for basic needs like shelter and sleep,
your set,

17
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.880
or are you the next day you get really hungry.

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.540
You work up the stomach to order more of those tender pig guts.

19
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.620
Your new found hosts with understanding clearly.
If I could talk,

20
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.340
these eyes would be saying,
yes,
come let us walk for miles through the hut.

21
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.300
Jungled together and yours would answer back please.
By all means.

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.390
So they lead you to a new village guests.

23
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:31.290
They were out of pig guts and had to talk to their suppliers.
No problem.
I mean,

24
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:35.220
surely this face knows where you can find a belly full of scrumptious trails.

25
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.590
Look,
so friendly.

26
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.090
Peer goes own gay bowl,

27
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.690
my friend.
What did you do?
All right.

28
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:53.220
Clearly you crossed the line.
Fortunately you're subscribed to native laying.

29
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:56.850
We're like insurance for your linguistic emergencies and double.
Fortunately,

30
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.730
you're not the first clue.
The Stranger to wash up on the shores.

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.460
Back in the 1960s anthropologist Roger Kissing lived with the Cryo.

32
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.360
Um,
oh yeah,
these are the choir fe high and they speak,

33
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.160
uh,
well.
Quiet casing uncovered something strange about their language.

34
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.930
See the choir really respect their ancestors.
There's a whole respect system.

35
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.370
You might call it pig slaughtering.
They call it full stop offering.

36
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.260
When important elders die,

37
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.890
they have a chance to become a super ancestor and undone low,

38
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.090
and that's amazing because then your adult grandchildren or great grandchildren

39
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.990
have to raise full with the pigs to sacrifice in your name.
Well,

40
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.150
not exactly in your name.
See,
that's the thing.

41
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.870
The root word in the envelopes name can become Umble taboo.

42
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.610
If the under lose descendants decide to farm well enforced this taboo,

43
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.590
it becomes offensive to utter that word in their presence.
Dare you.

44
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.460
If anyone ever wants to talk about you or you're a fourth a pig,

45
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.510
they have to use your photo or name a secret nickname for the under law God.

46
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.270
It that's due simple and you're wishing quite oh,

47
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.510
etiquette had like more nuanced,
complicated layers than this.

48
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.340
You win because those fault,

49
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.030
the nicknames that people use to honor the dead without violating the taboo.

50
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:18.031
Well sometimes those also become taboo and other pig needs a new nickname for

51
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.720
the taboo nickname that it needed because the original nickname was taboo.

52
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.730
The result is that the choir,
you have some mad serious taboos going on,

53
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.480
especially since most quiet,

54
00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:34.000
no names are made up of pretty useful basic words back in his day casing,

55
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:34.900
notice that fight,

56
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.310
fish and money were among the top five words used in both male and female names.

57
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.100
And this one time on a walk over to a new village,

58
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:46.090
his quite hosts nonchalantly warned him,
oh,
by the way,
while we're there,

59
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.840
don't ever say 40 a who he or la and la?

60
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.820
That's the word for fire.

61
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.600
When you break a taboo and you're face to face with those grim looks from the

62
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.080
village elders,
there's only one thing to do.
Set things straight.

63
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.740
The ghost of quail pass demands a sacrificial pig for your insolence.

64
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.240
But should you be short on pigs?
A little cash could settle this just fine.

65
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.950
Surely if they're living on an island but tattling words like fish,

66
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.740
they still need some way to talk about the fish.

67
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.910
So how do they replace taboo words?
Well,

68
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.840
sometimes they tweak the pronunciation until it just sounds different enough.

69
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
Like changing the word for dry from Ongais to RK or they raid vocabulary from a

70
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:33.410
nearby dialect.
That's how fire La got replaced by doing the west.

71
00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:37.830
Why a word for fire there?
Even hold descriptive runarounds like Uf,

72
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.520
a wife becoming [inaudible],
a woman of a man,

73
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.720
but typically they switch it out for a word that means something similar,

74
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.400
similar enough like pig guts going from own game,

75
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.140
bull stomach of pig to Uli.

76
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.030
Embol insight of pig and we're back to where this journey started.

77
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.320
The pig guts.
Precisely the info you needed to avoid that cultural blender.

78
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.480
You know the one where you demanded some food,

79
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:07.990
walk to the next town over and started cussing at the locals,
get a job.

80
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.940
The choir's not alone here.
It fits in with other oceanic languages.

81
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.330
So I guess don't be surprised when you thumb through your psionic dictionary and

82
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:21.250
see where it's crossed out.
Like,
yeah,
I'm don't say this anymore.
It's taboo.

83
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.340
But then this brings up some linguistic questions.

84
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.180
How does this taboo on naming the dead fit in with taboo terms?

85
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:32.710
And curses and profanity and other languages is taboo.
A wider,

86
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:37.360
more general phenomenon.
Also,
if words are getting replaced so often in quiet,

87
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.960
does it change how fast languages like choir,
we evolve over time,

88
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.970
so some advice if you're traveling to the depths of Oceania,

89
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.360
bring it up to date dictionary.
Of course,
if you want to wing it,

90
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.770
just carry around a lot of pigs or money.
Thanks for learning with me.

91
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.310
You're a real undiluted sticker out and subscribe for language.
