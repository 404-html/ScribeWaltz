Uh,

2
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 1>what does somebody mean when they refer to the converse inverse or</v>

3
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:19.670
contrapositive of a statement he could simple statement about,
um,

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.170
no,
not that.
No.
Wait,
back to,
ah,
I like that one.

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.940
Bikes have two wheels,
logical thinkers that you and I are,

6
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.890
we can see that this means everything that's a bike has two wheels.

7
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.220
The logical structure is for all x.

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.110
X is a bike implies x has two wheels.
Let's write that symbolically.

9
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.990
That's first order logic,

10
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.950
but we can just simplify that even further with the two propositions.

11
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.720
If you got a blank look on your face or your eyes are glazing over right now,

12
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.450
go back and check out my logic and language series.

13
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.230
You can play with that statement first.

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.120
Inverted the inverse of if it's a bike,

15
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.240
then it has two wheels is if it's not a bike than it does not have two wheels.

16
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.890
The inverse of a statement isn't necessarily true in this case.

17
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.800
There are two wheeled objects that are not bikes.

18
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.010
The converse of if it's a bike than it has two wheels switches the terms.

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.840
So we ended up with if it has two wheels than it's a bike.

20
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700
The converse may be true if the original is true,
but it isn't necessarily,

21
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.050
but notice that the converse will be true with the inverse is true.

22
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.000
Think about that.
The inverse negated.

23
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:48.260
Both propositions and the converse switched both propositions.

24
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.710
There's also a contrapositive with switching and negation going on for our

25
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:58.640
original statement.
If it's a bike,
then it has two wheels.

26
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.560
The contrapositive is if it's not two wheeled Ben,
it's not a bike.

27
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.950
Looks like that's true.
So long as the original was.

28
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.530
It's not good logic.

29
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:14.330
If we can't abstract these structures to other instances using any two

30
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:18.380
propositions,
a and B,
where a implies B,

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.730
we can get to the inverse,
the converse and the contrapositive this way.

32
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.630
<v 2>Something</v>

33
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.980
<v 1>to notice if you want to get even more playful with your logic is that you can</v>

34
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:50.960
use the concepts recursively on themselves.
What I mean is,
for example,

35
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:53.900
the inverse isn't just the universe of the statement.

36
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.790
It's also the converse of the contrapositive because it switches the two

37
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.810
propositions around and the contrapositive isn't just the contrapositive.

38
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.460
It's also the converse of the inverse.

39
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.830
This is possible because every statement can be reevaluated just like the

40
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:12.664
original.

41
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.080
They're not inherently in versus or converses or contrapositive.

42
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.920
They're just statements.
They're those things in relation to each other.

43
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.080
You'll find that people fumble with these terms or use them in precisely.

44
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.890
So take this first step to straighten out for yourself.

45
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.850
The relationship between a statement and the ways it can be twisted up.
