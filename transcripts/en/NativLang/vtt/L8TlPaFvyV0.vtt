00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.130
I just completed a web page and video series on the Greek minuscule script

2
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:18.131
sounded medieval documents stating from about 88 shifty to 1850 I realized that

3
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:22.940
some of my readers and viewers might wish to examine primary manuscripts for

4
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:24.830
yourselves.
Fortunately,

5
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:29.060
the British libraries digitized collection allows you to do just that from your

6
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:31.400
own computer,
up close and for free,

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.730
and the collection isn't limited to Greek texts either.

8
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.891
<v 1>In this video,</v>

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.020
I'm going to walk you through the basic features of their manuscript fewer.

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.390
I'll also offer some tips to help you get the most out of your copy practice if

12
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:47.780
you're learning these scripts as part of your language or calligraphy studies.

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.470
If you've had enough of me and just want to browse the collection and jumped

14
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:53.990
into viewing manuscripts,
here's the web address.

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.360
I'll also put it down in the inflow bar below.

16
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.670
When you visit their page,

17
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:06.790
you can browse manuscripts or search for a specific document.

18
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.790
Once you've clicked on a manuscript in his profile page,

19
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.810
you'll get a new tab with the manuscript viewer.
The top shows,

20
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.620
the manuscript title and content description.
A few key things to look for.

21
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:22.420
Here are the original author,
the work,
the year or date range,

22
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.810
and the manuscript number.
Below that,

23
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.180
the main body of the page is taken up by the viewer.

24
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.650
You'll see some handy controls on the upper right above the image and on the

25
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:34.360
upper left of the image itself.

26
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.140
The controls on the left allow you to zoom in and out,
reset your view.

27
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.970
Veal full screen or toggle show where height controls the dropdown lists and

28
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:46.900
arrows on the top right help you navigate through the entire manuscript.

29
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.350
The select list next to view lets you choose between viewing a single page open

30
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:57.880
book view with even pages on the left and odd pages on the right or folio view

31
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:02.230
with odd pages on the left and even pages on the ride.
Finally,

32
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.080
you'll need a bit more knowledge to navigate using page numbers.

33
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.870
Lowercase f stands for folio.

34
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
Our means recto or the front of a page vias verse so or the back of a page.

35
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.150
Each page number then refers to a whole leaf,
not just to one side of a sheet.

36
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.590
Also noticed the British library copyright on the bottom of the image.

37
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.770
Although the text of these manuscripts may be in the public domain,

38
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.200
the images themselves may have a different status.

39
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.750
Well that's good to get you started.

40
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.050
I hope you have fun as he reached into the past and explore some amazing

41
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:36.250
manuscript treasures,

42
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.360
some helpful tips if you will be doing copy practice in order to learn to write

43
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:45.111
in these hands.

44
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.740
I have a few hard one recommendations from my many hours of practice.

45
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.140
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.840
<v 1>right in a well lit area.
Adopt good posture,</v>

47
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.590
relax your eyes every once in awhile.
Copying can be strenuous,

48
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:00.730
especially when you're new and paying close attention to small details.

49
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.160
Zoom in on the text to see clearly.

50
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.030
This allows you to distinguish writing strokes and lifts of the pen.

51
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.870
Move from the basic to the tough.
Start with clear,

52
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.470
legible hands rather than challenging examples.
For example,

53
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.390
for students of the Greek miniscule hands,

54
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.600
I recommend learning the standard printed miniscule characters.

55
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.370
Then neat medieval minuscule documents.
Before you tackle examples like this,

56
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.800
look for words you recognize.
It's like decoding a puzzle.

57
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.320
You start with known values rather than the unknown.

58
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.190
Work with physical copies whenever possible.

59
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.320
This will go further in protecting your eyes,

60
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.800
since you may find yourself staring at a computer screen for hours on end to

61
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.850
imitate even brief texts and finer hands.
Of course,

62
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.930
avoid doing anything that will violate fair use.
Finally,

63
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.590
enjoy your pursuit as you participate in a long history of scrabbled tradition.

64
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.940
This is a wonderful and direct way to learn some visually stunning scripts.

65
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.450
As always,
thanks for taking the time to learn with me.

66
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.760
<v 2>MMM.</v>
