00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.260
All over India and Southeast Asia.
They write with these squiggly loopy Hangie,

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.220
sprouty scripts,
but perhaps the only thing cooler than the way they look.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.540
It's the way they work.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.470
<v 2>A spice market in India.</v>

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.310
The hooded figure in front of you apologizes for the kidnapping.

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.720
He needs her help.

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.680
He explains that his land has taken part in history's most elaborate and

8
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:31.420
rigorous memorization exercises instead of scribes.
They had recitations.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.120
These weren't retellings of campfire stories.

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.780
These were whole libraries of knowledge handed down for generations.

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
He says his name is Ashoka.
This is his land and he is king.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.710
After a bloody and violent war.

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.540
He had a change of heart and now has but one singular focus to spread his

14
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:53.350
message.
A love tolerance and compassion throughout the land,

15
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.400
but he doesn't want to use the mouth to ear memorization ways of the oral

16
00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.630
tradition.
That's for old pets and old ideas.
No,

17
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:04.930
his vision is to install massive pillars around his empire.

18
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.480
Each one engraved with his list of edicts.

19
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.300
This he explains is where you come in.

20
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.470
See He's been keeping tabs on you as you roamed the land of the submitted odd

21
00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:18.910
jobs.
And he really likes this crazy consonant alphabet idea.
He'll take it.

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.260
But he also appreciates the whimsical simplicity of accent and consonance with

23
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:24.670
vowel marks.
Oh.

24
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:27.590
And he doesn't want to have to write the vowel if it's just a short,
uh,

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.350
his language is full of those.

26
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.000
So he'll write funnel something like this with these built in syllables,

27
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.040
but wait,
it's not funnel.
Uh,
that final,
oh,
isn't a separate syllable.

28
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.150
He needs a way to write,
just bear consonants to tell his past,

29
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:44.440
apart from his pasta.

30
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.250
How with a simple hush stroke below the letter.

31
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.610
Now he brags to you,
his system is complete.

32
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.180
Make sure you don't miss the step he's taking here.

33
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.140
It's a major moment in the history of writing.

34
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.890
Each of the character units fundamentally represents a syllable.

35
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.180
It just so happens that unless the vowel and not syllable is a short,
aw,

36
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.370
the val gets added on to or below or beside the consonant character on their

37
00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:16.180
own,
the base characters contain that dummy vowel,
ah,
like puff.

38
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
But you can take that and modify it with any vowel.
You light.

39
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.970
Certain bowels go in certain places like e to the side or Ooh below,

40
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.380
so in India characters or syllables,
but unlike a full ciliary,

41
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:33.670
you don't need a completely separate character for each separate syllable and

42
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:38.110
all characters give consonant plus vowel information,
but unlike a full alphabet,

43
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.220
you don't line up sequences of consonants plus vowels,
consonants,
plus vowels.

44
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.920
The hybrid combination nature of this system earns it.

45
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:49.360
The name Alpha syllabary combos are built into this system,

46
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:54.361
paving the way for over a thousand ligatures commonly linked characters in the

47
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.630
Alpha Ciliary.
Sure.

48
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.360
Other writing systems developed ligatures and their calligraphy,

49
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.690
but the Alpha ciliary welcomes them naturally as it's past all around this

50
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:08.170
entire slice of the world up to Nepal and Tibet down the coast to Burma,

51
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.010
Thailand,
Laos,
Cambodia,
and beyond.
The script keeps updating its look,

52
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.510
but continues to capture consonants and vowels accurately like an alphabet and

53
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.840
to write those vowels,
consonants,
and syllable units like the syllabary,

54
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.250
even completely unrelated,
Alpha Cilla.
Barry's seize on this same idea.

55
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.680
This is the Ethiopic symbol for ma.

56
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.980
This one reads May and this is Moo.

57
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.690
This is La Ley and loop.
Now that you understand that was still the berries.

58
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:39.070
You must answer this next question.
If this symbol sounds like blah,

59
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.240
how do you write bay and Bu and Ethiopia?
This is your Gig is a,
B,

60
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.640
c D's.
The [inaudible] Gita looks different,
but works much the same way.

61
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.110
Your characters have never looked so different even after the Greeks and Romans

62
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:53.944
took them over.

63
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.480
Maybe it's this dizzying variety of writing systems or maybe thoughts.

64
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:00.130
Pill is starting to wear off.

65
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>
