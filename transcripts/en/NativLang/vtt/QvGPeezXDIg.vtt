1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.910
So you know how a Chinese is just picture writing.

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.040
There's more to this story,

3
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.330
like all of the world's earliest writing systems.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.560
Chinese characters start out as symbols that Stanford words,
a rice patty,

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.420
a person,
a treat please,

6
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:31.440
our logo graphs and they let you depict specific language pieces to write what

7
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.980
you mean.
But instead of requiring different characters for every word,

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
the handy rebus principle lets you write other things that sound like the lower

9
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:41.070
graph to write what you say.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.240
Sure you could use the rebus sounds like principal to write any sound in your

11
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:49.290
language,
but please consider this symbol and answer the question that follows.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
Does it mean son soon son or sewn?

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.870
Oh my.
Did free bus riding.
Get you into a bit of trouble here.

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.210
When we see this character,

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
we could read it as a plain old logo graph according to its meaning or any of

16
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.020
these rebus ways following gets pronunciation.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.910
Which one should you choose to think a bit outside of the jade box here and take

18
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:15.300
the lead of this hand scratch his solution is elegant.

19
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.380
Don't choose one.
Use both systems together.

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.910
What's that?
Behind his back.
Is that a ho?
Yeah.

21
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.970
Major moments in the history of writing.

22
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.350
So here's the logo graph for horse,

23
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.520
but it also sounds the same as the word for aunt said.

24
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:37.540
The rebus principle lets us write them both with the same glyphs.
Confusing,

25
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.560
not if you add the logo graph for insect next to the stound delight character.

26
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.680
This says it's pronounced like horse,
which it is,

27
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.320
but that it's meaning has something to do with insect.

28
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.420
You don't read the extra character.

29
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.660
It's a meaning hint determining how to read the sound character.

30
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.740
So it's called [inaudible]

31
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.573
<v 2>terminated.</v>

32
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.790
<v 0>One more mandarin example.
This loga graph means moon,</v>

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.470
which happens to be pronounced UAA using rebus writing.
Yay.

34
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.710
Awesome means amputate your feet.
Incidentally,

35
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:11.210
the word key is pronounced the same way.
Same problem,
but nothing.

36
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:13.250
A couple determinative can't fix.

37
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.630
Add the determinative for metal to this character at knife to that one.

38
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.610
And let's leave the moon B because that's already what it means here.
Again,

39
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:25.730
the sounds like reading of the character gives you it's phonetic component.

40
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.670
This extra Logograph clues you into its meaning.

41
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.730
It's semantic component together.
They form a unit,

42
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.490
a whole character with a clear meaning and a clear pronunciation determinative

43
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:40.160
is are very common in Chinese characters,
natively called Han Carrie.

44
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.350
<v 2>In fact,
since they hint at the characters route,</v>

45
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.830
meaning it's Radix Han determinative get called radicals.

46
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.440
Bringing back the characters sun.
It can be pronounced many ways,
truth,

47
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.520
but at a determinative,
yeah,

48
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.420
<v 0>a silent helper character and you can quickly narrow down.</v>

49
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:01.120
It's meaning these extra avoid ambiguous readings.

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.690
Which one is the sun in the sky,
which is a father son,

51
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.510
which one means soon too easy.

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.780
There's something else to learn from this quiet scribe.

53
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.480
He's using radicals to clean up some ambiguity,

54
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.970
but even he knows that context matters.

55
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
He won't spell everything out for you every time.

56
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.070
Sometimes this character means for as in this is for you.

57
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.320
Other Times it's the verb supply.

58
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.580
He's balancing this tension in the history of writing between what's easy on the

59
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.270
reader,

60
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.750
who needs more information to interpret the words versus what's easy on the

61
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.930
writer,
who typically knows what he means when he's writing it.

62
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.580
Plus hand cramps.
The choice of leaving in or leaving out.

63
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.790
Helpful information isn't simply about clarity and laziness.

64
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.980
It's a static throughout the history of Chinese calligraphy from Oracle loans to

65
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.180
the rough cursive script.

66
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.170
Stylistic choices are made not just semantic and phonetic choices.

67
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.720
Seeing through the calligraphers eyes,

68
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.230
you can find in the history of writing not only a vision of what words and

69
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:06.220
sounds look like,
but where words and sounds go and where they stop.

70
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.260
When it comes to aesthetic choices and Han characters,

71
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.040
none is more fundamental than the decision to arrange character components in

72
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:16.630
blocks.
Bonus note,

73
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.830
this is definitely not the only time in history that writing gets organized in

74
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:21.664
blocks.

75
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.530
So this radical sits on top of this phonetic component in a block making up one

76
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:31.270
whole character.
The character for flour,
the idiographic man plus tree,

77
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.800
a man leaning against a tree has two components sitting side by side in a block

78
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.820
and they're the character for rest.
And here's one tree and its own block,

79
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.890
two trees,
meaning woods and three trees for forest.
Aesthetics aside,

80
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.030
what would happen if we took,

81
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.810
this sounds like principal a step further and made writing about this sounds,

82
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.910
isn't that a better solution to our soon son sown son problem and one that

83
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.250
doesn't make us memorize tons of characters.
