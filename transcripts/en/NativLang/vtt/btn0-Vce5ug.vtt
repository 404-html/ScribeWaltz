1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.540
I have this dream of doing a spelling beyond steroids.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.110
The contestants lineup facing a wheel labeled with a bunch of the world's

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:11.460
languages step write ups in that wheel and wherever it happens to land,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
you have to read a word and write a word in that languages native writing
system.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.570
Who,
who as a language nerd,

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.270
there's a lot that intimidates me about this spelling bee,

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
but I must confess there's one maniacally tuft written language that I really

8
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.720
hope this we'll never lands on.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.700
I am excited.

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.090
Let's go through and list why each one of these scripts has some tricky letters.

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
And then at the end I will reveal to you the language with the world's scariest

12
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.330
spelling.
Number 10.
Wait,
what was that?
Uh,
come again.

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
This just in,
but apparently someone else already answered my question.

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.500
He swears that the worst script ever is Thai.
Hmm.

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.790
Really?
I mean,
I messed with Lao and Thai a few years ago.
Yeah,

16
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.200
they weren't super easy,
but tie.
Oh,
okay.

17
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:08.100
Here's his complaint.
See when a written language grows up and gets old.

18
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.230
The way people speak at changes over time,

19
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.200
but the way people write the language stays fossilized.

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.470
The result is historical spelling and ty has some blatant historical spelling.

21
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.020
Not only is Britain tie pretty old,
but even when it was new,

22
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:26.580
it modeled it's letters on Sanskrit,
so it inherited fossils from the getgo.

23
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.680
Ty has an Alpha syllabary with 44 consonant letters for riding,

24
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.180
just 21 consonant sounds plus vowels and tone marks,

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
plus a complicated way of figuring out how all of those letters work together to

26
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.260
tell you which tone to pronounce on which Val.

27
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.950
But I think this missed the point.

28
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.970
What is it about historical spelling that makes this script tough?

29
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.180
Consider two people.
First,
the reader,

30
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.450
won't you consider the reader a script is hard when I don't know which sound to

31
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:03.450
save for the letters I'm about to read and for the writer,

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.080
this script is hard if I don't know which letters to use for the sounds I want

33
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.840
to right now glance back at Thai.

34
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.220
There's something regular and predictable about it is especially for the reader.

35
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.610
We can sum it up in a not too long page on Wikipedia.

36
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.420
We can dust are hands off and set you loose on the language and you should do

37
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:23.520
fairly well.
In fact,

38
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.550
I think of Thai spelling is not too different from Greek in a way.

39
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.420
A bunch of letters come together to represent a smaller set of sounds.

40
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.430
It's that same many to one correspondence all also like tie some sounds

41
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.640
influenced others in predictable ways and yeah,

42
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.710
there aren't those tie tones to deal with,

43
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.160
but you're stuck with the Greek throne of system with its movable accents and

44
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.400
double accidents based on how pitch and val length used to work way back in

45
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.360
ancient Athens.
Yeah,
no,
no,
no.

46
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.310
Don't fear time.
My friend look elsewhere.
It's got mountains,

47
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:59.190
it's got llamas.
It's got Buddhists talking.
Dama,

48
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.330
welcome to Tibet.

49
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.700
History tells us that Tibetans have this guy to thank for writing some tin

50
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.450
gumball.
Pardon the spelling there.
Sneak preview.

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.040
He brought kingdoms together to form the vast Tibetan empire.
He said,
hey guys,

52
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.890
we're Buddhist now and around the year six 30 he said,

53
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:20.440
a young minister to India to learn how to write.

54
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.630
What he brought back from India was a new Alpha syllabary just like tie.

55
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.690
They both emphasize consonants and surround them with Val's.

56
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.980
They both came with Buddhism,

57
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.270
so both have special conventions for transcribing sacred Sanskrit terms and

58
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.380
nowadays they both have to deal with tones and convoluted ways they weren't

59
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.370
designed to handle,
but written Tibetans is much,

60
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.220
much older.
Here's the basics.

61
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.760
You start with the base consonants with their builtin dummy vowels.

62
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.030
Then you learn to write vowels and was and rose in the years as little flags on

63
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:59.110
the consonants,
but it gets even more exotic.
Tibetan can stack consonants.

64
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.340
You can flip consonants.

65
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.510
It can clump together masses of consonants to build syllables that look like

66
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.320
this.

67
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.240
This is how to bet and spell these words and this is how they say them.

68
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.870
Did that sink in for you?
This is what people are reading.

69
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.810
This is what people are saying.

70
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.530
This tangled mess of consonants is why Yeti?
Yeah,

71
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:24.550
Jay is spelled bread.
Why the Tibetan languages,

72
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.980
even though it's really boosts and this the name for this cling on looking

73
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.040
beauty.
That is the Tibetan script.
How do you think it's pronounced?

74
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.020
And he clue time's up.
It's,
Ooh,
check.
Yeah.

75
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.350
If you think reading with these letters is hard,

76
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.020
you should try writing with them in Lhasa.

77
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.560
The sound's dupe might mean any of these words.

78
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.400
It might mean overflows,
accomplishes,
sows,

79
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.540
or even other forms of the verb accomplish like accomplished and we'll

80
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.960
accomplish.
But guess what?
Those are all spelled differently.

81
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.550
The puzzles don't stop.
Take two words with very similar spelling.

82
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760
The one spelled grubs gets pronounced top and Greg's why that's wrong.

83
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.250
Give up yet.
Well,
there is some logic here.
Here's the deal.

84
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.230
Tibetan has core letters,

85
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.650
it has valves around those core letters and then outside letters.

86
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.050
And once you grasp that basic fact,

87
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:25.420
you can start figuring out which letters to ignore.

88
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.280
Like in this verb that looks like besides socks be as a prefix and the s is a

89
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.150
suffix.
So you can just concentrate on getting these middle letters right.

90
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.830
Suck maybe.
Okay.
And now you're thinking,
I get it.

91
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.280
It's the vowel and some other letters in the middle of the syllable I care
about.

92
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.550
I can just ignore everything else.
Damn [inaudible] to Ben.

93
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.300
Dangerous strategy there for two reasons.
Number one,

94
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.010
you need to know which letters not to ignore.
And reason number two,

95
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.830
we can't just drop letters and walk away like that.

96
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.300
Tibetan has a complicated relationship.

97
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.090
We're letters influenced the pronunciation of other letters,

98
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.080
meaning a silent letter can still change the way of their letters get
pronounced.

99
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.180
So the name of one of the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism is written like
this.

100
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.010
We might innocently cross out all of these sounds and say something like Ka

101
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.960
Queue,
but that Tibetan,
Ooh,
actually sounds like the German [inaudible] the air.

102
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.700
It acts that way because of the final d.
That's after it got cute.

103
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.290
Lucky you though.
Ooh,
Ooh.

104
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.020
Isn't the only vowel change that works this way and d isn't the only continent

105
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.500
that triggers it.
So yeah,

106
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.370
if you're dropping letters here,
you're influencing letters with ghosts,
letters,

107
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.160
and sometimes you're not even just dropping an influencing.

108
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.180
You're finding out that whole clusters of letters interact together to create

109
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:51.350
totally different sounds,
complex patterns.
It's all a complex patterns.

110
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.340
Now things ratch it up another notch.
When you put syllables together,

111
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.470
sometimes you'll find a letter that silent,

112
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:02.471
like say silent are before another consonant in the word [inaudible] so you

113
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.960
might cross it out and then forget about it just to have it suddenly pop out at

114
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:09.530
you when you smash it against another syllable,
like in this name,

115
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.130
to keep every little bit of this in mind when you run crying to your Tibetan

116
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:17.150
dictionary for help because the Tibetan idea of alphabetical order is not

117
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:22.010
organizing words by the first letter.
No,
no,
no,
no.
They use that route,
letter,

118
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.750
wherever it happens to be.
Why do you do this to bed?

119
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.800
Science says that being a high altitude mountain people,

120
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.150
Tibetans have physiological advantages like increased blood flow to the brain.

121
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.960
Maybe they're spending that power on this bizarre writing system,

122
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.740
but honestly they did try to get rid of this bad spelling.
Karma.

123
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.520
Really Old Tibetan got a spelling reform in the year 800 and then,

124
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.200
well that that was it 1200 years ago.

125
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.040
Think of what's happened in 1200 years.
The Viking Age,

126
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.200
the Norman conquest of England,

127
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.910
everything ever written in tie the last end codices,
Chaucer,

128
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.380
Shakespeare with Tokugawa Shogun.

129
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.350
These are current events compared to the last time to bet changed its spelling.

130
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.950
That is some serious historical spelling and it's why when I'm standing there

131
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.980
watching the wheel clack clack clack around deciding my fate in that

132
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:24.350
multilingual spelling bee,
I really,

133
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.650
really hope that wheel doesn't land to bet.

134
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.910
Assuming we're thinking spelling means segmental scripts,

135
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.980
ones where we're matching letters to sounds,

136
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.950
but I'm going to step out of the bounds of this game show here because if we

137
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:41.240
color outside the Mandola lines to Betten isn't even the worst offender when it

138
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:46.130
comes to historical spelling and there's a written language that plays much

139
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:50.660
faster and looser with its symbols and expects way more readers and writers than

140
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:54.740
Tibetans ever could.
Thanks for joining me and my spelling bee.

141
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.120
I really liked having you here.

142
00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.690
Stick around and subscribed for language Tibetan on.
