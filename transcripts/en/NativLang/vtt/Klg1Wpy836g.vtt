1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.673
Caucasian.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
That word comes to us from a rugged land where Europe smacks into Asia,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.640
sandwiched between countries and always grab headlines.
Russia,
Iran,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.730
Turkey.
But here's a headline for you.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.110
This little area is one of the world's great linguistic hot zones,

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.010
a place where the mountains are full of languages.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.500
Welcome to the caucuses.

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.683
<v 1>Yay.</v>

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.760
<v 0>Georgia is a US state that's about 300 miles tall with a population over 10</v>

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410
million.
Most everyone here speaks one language.
English.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.540
I turned off the global way.

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.570
Straddling the south east of Europe is a country we called Turkey and east of

13
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:51.480
Turkey.
There's another Georgia watch.

14
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.570
What happens when I take Georgia and put it over Georgia?

15
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
There's a lot more Georgia left.
It leaks into Russia and over into Azerbaijan.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.760
It even covers part of Armenia and Turkey.

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.020
Whole these borders between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,

18
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
but these are nothing compared to the number of languages here.

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
As the Kurdish saying goes,
we have no friends but the mountains,

20
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.050
I don't know Kurdish or the more than 50 languages of the caucuses,

21
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
but Kurdish is a distant relative of the words I'm speaking right now.

22
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.760
It's in the Iranian branch of our Indo European family,

23
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.990
which is something it's shares with the Scythians last descended on [inaudible].

24
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.020
You can hear echoes of familiar words.

25
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.200
I like the word for door diddy wad in Armenia.

26
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:45.870
Adore sounds similar door,

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.120
but Armenian is a separate Indo European branch.
They're unique.

28
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.850
Alphabet was created by this gentleman,

29
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:56.850
scholar Mr Mush totes making Armenian,

30
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.540
one of the rare languages in the region with its own old writings.

31
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.440
Some Armenians claim mush.

32
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:06.630
Totes also taught the Georgians how to write a Georgians beg to differ.

33
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.910
Armenian splits another language down the middle in this disputed turf.

34
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.350
We're the name you give it and whether you call the fighting in the nineties

35
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.160
liberation or occupation is 10th stuff.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.710
This other language belongs to the country with the world's lowest capital,

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.640
nearly 100 feet,
30 meters below sea level.

38
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.760
Azerbaijani.
After all that Indo European,

39
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.040
it looks strange unless you know Turkish.

40
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.870
The Turkic family has multiple branches all over the Caucasus.

41
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.220
It builds long words with glued on endings were the vowels harmonize a lot like

42
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:55.600
Hungarian.
Remember things aren't so Turkic up here in Europe,

43
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.070
only Buddhist region.
This is called Makia,

44
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.680
a Russian republic settled by oil rots who speak a relative of Mongolian.

45
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.730
So there's Mongolia here,
there's Hellenic here,
caucuses,
Greek.

46
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.850
There's Semitic a Syrian,
neo,
Aramaic.

47
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.020
But there was one obvious blob we ignored.
Come on.

48
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.740
Who brings the big guns into this area?
Metaphorically speaking,
of course,

49
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.790
Russian in the Slavic branch of Indo European

50
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.590
a couple of years ago,

51
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.390
Russia held the Winter Olympics in the city of Sochi drama and sued.

52
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.780
What attracted a lot of press was the exorbitant cost,

53
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.720
but there's another controversy you may have missed.

54
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
Ethnic [inaudible] have long considered Sochi their land taken in the 18

55
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.940
hundreds when the Russian empire vowed to conquer the Caucasus and pacify or

56
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:54.280
expel every indigenous group.

57
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.500
One of the men in that army was Leo Tolstoy and this is where he tasted.

58
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.820
Warren started writing

59
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.920
the last speaker of Sochi Oobleck language died in Turkey in 1992 with him

60
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.340
parish,
the largest consonant inventory outside of Africa,

61
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.600
over three times as many as English and just to be extreme,

62
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:19.600
only two basic vowels.
Ah,
and Ah,

63
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.970
this is the kind of special stuff that keeps language nerds infatuated with

64
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:26.800
indigenous Caucasian languages.

65
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.260
Indigenous means something special here.
See for linguists,

66
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.460
there are languages of the caucuses and then Caucasian languages.

67
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.390
These smaller families born in and limited to the caucuses.

68
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.340
Few vowels,

69
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.490
many consonants including throaty sounds Ah,

70
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.070
ah,
ah,

71
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.270
English has one such sound Arabic,
several,

72
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.050
no competition for these Caucasian tongs.
Oh,

73
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.180
and they probably had even more in the past,

74
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.020
but the real Caucasian hot topic came from one example in an old grammar of

75
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.903
Silva Touche.

76
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.790
There was an intransitive verb with the subject that could resemble an object.

77
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.430
I fell and it was my fault,

78
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.630
like on purpose versus fell me on accident.

79
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.680
It sounds simple,
but the implications were huge.

80
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.390
This example fell into the right hands and the concept of Ergot tivity became a

81
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.800
linguistic rockstar

82
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.510
in 1770 a German naturalist set out on an expedition to the caucuses,

83
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.060
trekking with a royal cub Ardian and Georgian entourage.

84
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.440
He took notes and divided Caucasian languages into four families,

85
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.240
each one with its own prodo language.
And he did this over a decade before,

86
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:53.950
a well known speech by Sir William Jones that drew attention to classifying into

87
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:58.400
European.
Later there did come a one family fits all,

88
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.670
pushed to bundle them into I bureau Caucasian.

89
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.670
The idea ultimately failed to win converts.

90
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.740
Today we count three families northwest,
northeast,

91
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.023
south,

92
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.510
the Self Cart velien includes Jorgen and indigenous language with its own

93
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.930
ancient literature.

94
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.120
And the reason why Joseph Stalin a native Georgian had HUD accent patterns in

95
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.850
his speeches.
So the two Stowe,

96
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.940
that's in northeast Caucasian of family native to the border republics of

97
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:32.600
Dagestan and Chechnya.

98
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.100
Chechen has an oddly large number of vowels for Caucasian language.

99
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.100
This line marks or republic where they speak a Georgian dialect.

100
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.430
They're on good terms but not so in these dots where they broke away in 1992

101
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.690
with 13 months of ethnic strife.

102
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.890
The local up cause is part of northwest Caucasian,

103
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.140
the family of [inaudible] and your old consonant,
full friend Rubik.

104
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.810
This family has been blamed for making Caucasian hard to classify.
See,

105
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:09.310
they have these roots with one measly consonant and they do something called

106
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.070
head marking.
As a result,
they can lose.

107
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:16.840
Resemblance is more quickly making it harder to compare them and find siblings.

108
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.580
Caucasian isn't one family,
is it one area though?

109
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.160
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

110
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.030
<v 0>Perhaps the languages co-existed long enough to pick up each other's habits.</v>

111
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.710
Snot out of the question.

112
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:34.711
We saw how it happened in Mesoamerica still debated if this even fits for the

113
00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:38.740
caucuses.
So maybe not a language area,

114
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.980
but definitely an area with lots of languages and you still gotta be wondering

115
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.210
why,
why so many

116
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.480
Joanna Nichols tells us the answer may not be on the speaker's lips,

117
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.130
but under their feet.

118
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.090
Geography gives some families spread zones,

119
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:03.010
easy terrain for expanding.
Other terrains are residuals,

120
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:05.560
zones,
holding languages in place.

121
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.070
Which zone is responsible here?

122
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.950
I hope you said both languages from the lowlands flow into the area.

123
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.760
Then the mountains keep them.

124
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.160
So the three Caucasian families survived in place and didn't spread beyond

125
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.020
overtime.
Others pass through and got stuck and the diversity grew.

126
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.290
We end up with this map,

127
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.880
a map of more than 50 languages across seven families,

128
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.630
each splash of color with its own stories to tell,

129
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.230
stick around and subscribe for links.
