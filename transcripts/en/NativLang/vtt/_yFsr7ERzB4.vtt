1
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.390
Latin downs used case endings to mark the nouns function in a sentence.

2
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.700
Take the name Bruce as a subject.
It's in the nominative case.

3
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.130
Brutus became brutal as an object.
It's a neat accusative case.

4
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.230
The romance languages ditch this case system over the centuries,

5
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.020
but the few lingering remnants are worth our attention.

6
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.690
The basic form of a now comes from the accusative case.
We saw that last time,

7
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.850
so nominative Moodle's isn't the source of Italian Moodle,
French movie,

8
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.530
Romance meal,
etc. Those all come from the accusative Moodle,

9
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.420
which became vulgar Latin Moodle.
That's the general historical trend,

10
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.370
but there are exceptions.
Old French held onto the nominative for quite awhile.

11
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.890
Take the Latin down.
Lupus,

12
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.910
which meant wolf and the accused of form of it was Lupul,

13
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.920
old French distinguished,
a nominative bloops from an accusative loop.

14
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.230
Still the push to simplify was very strong and even modern French today just has

15
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:51.064
Lou.

16
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.540
The difference between nominative and accusative matters in the plural,

17
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
not in any single romance language,
but across the family.

18
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.570
Eastern romance languages take their plural forms from the Latin nominative.

19
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.770
So vulgar Latin Lupa with the nominative plural,
loopy,

20
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.600
gives us Italian blue boy and

21
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.090
the western romance languages hold onto the accusative plural instead.

22
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.830
So Lupu with the accusative plural do post gives us Sardinian,

23
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.950
Lupus and Lupus Romansh roof and loose for wolf and wolf.

24
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.220
What about the other Latin cases besides nominative and accusative?

25
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.743
For the most part,

26
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
they died out Romanian languages including standard Romanian [inaudible],

27
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:42.370
Romanian and related languages have endings.

28
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.820
Combining the genitive and dated cases,
what are those?

29
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.300
The genitive is like a possessive as in the wolf's bone and the date of

30
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.620
indicates a recipient to the wolf.

31
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.850
Romanian Casa has a genitive data form Caci,

32
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.830
but I see these Romanian genitive date of nouns with the definite article

33
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.900
articles that didn't even exist in classical Latin lupus.
Men Wolf,

34
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.290
a wolf or the wolf depending on context.

35
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.440
Vulgar Latin speakers innovated articles,

36
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.480
specifically the word Elu accusative case,

37
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.920
masculine gender for it.

38
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.980
That came to mean the with masculine nouns just as Ella did with feminine nouns.

39
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.270
Eloper Italian,
he Lupa to French Lulu,

40
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.410
Katelyn,
a yacht or a la Casa,

41
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.290
which gave us words like Italian,
Black Aza,

42
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.961
Galician.

43
00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:52.090
Then Portuguese whittled the definite articles down to just Ooh and ahh.

44
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.840
As you see,
it's important to know the gender of your nouns.

45
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.150
The gender of the article matches the announced gender

46
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.910
Sardinian and belly Arik.
Katelyn views IEPs,

47
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.530
so the same word we find an ipso facto,
so it's [inaudible],

48
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.020
so Lupo and his Israel,

49
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.470
we find the feminine was east side,

50
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.450
so Sardinian and Katelyn side
in Romanian.

51
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.280
Definite articles attached to the end of a noun.
Lube oil.
Lou Not Isla.

52
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.290
Lupo explains Romanian loophole and Casa Eli Becomes Casa.

53
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.910
The plurals of these definite articles mimic the announced.

54
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:43.890
They sit in here by now.
You know that Lupo has the plural loopy in the east,

55
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.120
but lupus in the west and Casa has the plural Casa in the east,

56
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.440
but Casa us in the west.

57
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.980
You probably even remember why it's no surprise then that you Lupo has the

58
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:59.160
plural elution Lupus in the west Los Lobos.

59
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.440
They Lou is loose,

60
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.880
which low Bush or that illy loopy remains in the east.

61
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.020
He loopy in Italian and loopy in Romanian

62
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.000
languages.
Unanimously used the word one for the indefinite article.

63
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.683
We're not Casa.

64
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.500
The plural son is dealt with in various ways.

65
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.050
Many languages allow the bear.
Now

66
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.390
Iberian languages like Spanish may use the plural of one to mean son who knows

67
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.121
logos which low Bush French and Occitan use the Latin word day,

68
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.610
which means some of,
or some

69
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.383
<v 0>they do.</v>

70
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.510
<v 1>Romanians can use [inaudible] as in [inaudible].</v>

71
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.100
Romance languages are often skiddish about bear nouns,

72
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.220
especially as subjects we see Sardinian sort of Lupus or Italian,

73
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.140
he loopy,
we're English has just wolf's.

74
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.660
It's also true of bear singulars expect vulgar Latin Elijah [inaudible],

75
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.150
Italian luxurious Dexia,

76
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.360
French luxury steeze oh meaning v Justice instead of the non for justice by

77
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:34.924
itself.

78
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.790
That French and oxygen article with Dei is an instance of a partitive article.

79
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.540
You'll also find it in Italian Juva.

80
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.070
They'll vino means someway louver Iovino mean wine in general.

81
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.820
It's an innovation you won't find in languages along the periphery.
Spanish,

82
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.920
Portuguese or Romanian for instance.

83
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.180
Last back to those Romanian articles and that curious genitive date of case

84
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.110
Romanian nouns tack an article to their back as an ending.

85
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
We've already seen that with Lupul and loopy that ending changes in the genitive

86
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.340
data

87
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.750
<v 0>loop loop,
loop loop.
Lulu,</v>

88
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.920
<v 1>if you've been following along and maybe taking notes over the last two videos,</v>

89
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.970
you'll have some understanding of how nouns work in the romance languages.

90
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.500
We're going to build on that,
but next time we focus our attention on verbs.
