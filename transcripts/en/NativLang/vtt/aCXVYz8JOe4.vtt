00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.130
Uh,
oh,

2
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.090
<v 1>chicken language video series introduced logic as a way of representing an</v>

3
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.380
analyzing sentences,

4
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.280
but I skirted around questions of truth and establishing good arguments.

5
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.820
I'd like to take a stab at those topics,
those skills.
In this video,

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.140
we paid attention to the structure of sentences and use symbolic logic to

7
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:34.390
represent that structure.
On that front,

8
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:37.600
logic provides a handy way to sort out and clarify or statements.

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.440
Please make sure to go through those videos.
If you understand that material,

10
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.440
you can see that the logic of the statement,
like for example,

11
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:49.240
water is a liquid maybe represented as follows for all x.

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.400
If x is water,
then x is illiquid.

13
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.760
Now that you have that kind of grasp on logical statements,

14
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:58.180
you can extend your logic to whole arguments with multiple statements.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.130
When I say argument,
I'm afraid you may be hearing heated exchange and forwards,

16
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.970
but I mean instead of series of statements made it supportive and assertion

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.940
together with the assertion drawn from those statements.

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200
The supporting statements at our premises of the argument and the assertion that

19
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:17.470
follows from them is the conclusion right now.

20
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.920
I went to convince you that coffee is a food not in beverage.
Yeah,

21
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:23.620
you heard that right?
I'll start with some sentences.

22
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:27.520
We both except coffee is a beam.
Remember your logic here.

23
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.140
I'm saying that for all x,

24
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.170
if x is coffee than x and bean beans are food so it follows that all coffees of

25
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:39.700
food.
I brought you to a conclusion using two supporting premises,

26
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.150
but you might think I'm pulling something over on you here.

27
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:44.860
Maybe you can't even put your finger on it.

28
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.510
Hold your criticism for now and consider the structure of my argument first is

29
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:53.110
the form of my argument.
Any good?
Well what it is,
its form.

30
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.340
Let's abstract the argument to a is B,
B is c,

31
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.320
therefore a is c.
You'll find that however you fill in this structure,

32
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.000
the argument seems to work.

33
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.870
I bet you're even smart enough to see why you really are.
So let's move along.

34
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.130
If on the other hand I tried to fill out the argument with a structure like

35
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.020
premise one a is B premise to a is c conclusion,

36
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.610
therefore be as see,

37
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.240
it turns out that the argument doesn't work.

38
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.290
Apply this form to a few cases and you'll figure it out pretty quickly that it

39
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:27.124
fails.

40
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.750
Arguments with a working structure are valid arguments that are broken,

41
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.580
get the negative label invalid.

42
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.870
It would be premature of us to stop there and declare that we have a watertight

43
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:40.090
argument.
We've checked our structure,

44
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.150
but we haven't thought about whether we've filled our form with correct

45
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:47.380
statements.
The premises can be true or false and the conclusion true or false.

46
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:51.040
As a result,
I could propose that all soups are cold.

47
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.700
Anything that's cold can't bring your mouth so clearly soups can't burn your

48
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.510
mouth.

49
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.680
The argument has a valid structure but one of its supporting premises false

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.020
which impacts the conclusion I'm trying to draw.

51
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.390
If our argument is valid and has true premises,
it's a sound argument.

52
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.730
This may strike you as straight forward,

53
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.570
but it's easy to get lazy or manipulative with your logic and end up producing

54
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.820
or being convinced by unsound arguments.

55
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.870
Or should I say it's easy for the other guy but not forced?

56
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:20.290
The logical mind is yours.

57
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.940
Notice that either truth or validity can impact the soundness of an argument.

58
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.470
Unsound arguments include an invalid argument with true premises,

59
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.000
a valid argument with one or more untrue premises and an invalid argument with

60
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.780
untrue premises only.
A valid argument with true premises and sound,

61
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.070
a tidbit you may be aware of,
but our argument structure introduced above a is B.

62
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.000
B is c,
so a is c is called a syllogism,

63
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.660
so my coffee is food is a valid syllogism with,

64
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.550
I will assert true premises if that's all correct.
The argument is sound,

65
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.770
not all arguments are syllogisms.
Notice that we have two conditional premises.

66
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.900
If a then B,
if B,
then c and the conclusion follows from these conditions.

67
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.471
Therefore,

68
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:10.471
if a then c we could just use one conditional premise like if a then B,

69
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.290
if we assert in a second premise that a we conclude that you guessed it be,

70
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.050
I haven't looked outside these arguments to support them,

71
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.890
I just relied on the structure and persuasiveness of the premises to make my

72
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:24.724
point.

73
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.060
The meaning and words are all there for you to evaluate and if these are good,

74
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:29.560
then the conclusions good too.

75
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.360
That's deductive reasoning and the resulting argument is called a deductive

76
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.380
argument.
Once I start checking my facts outside my bare words,

77
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.820
things get trickier if I want to support my assertion that coffee is beans.

78
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.810
I have to use inductive reasoning to look at specific information in the real

79
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.470
world and make abstract generalizations about all coffee.

80
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.230
Even though I could never hope to check if what I'm saying is true,

81
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.270
even of a fraction of the world's coffee,

82
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.470
such claims are probabilistic and open until I can demonstrate that they are

83
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:03.190
false and arguments that take this line of reasoning are inductive.

84
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.600
For instance,

85
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.350
I can't demonstrate that my first premise is true of all coffee ever,

86
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.180
but I can state things that probably hold which requires inductive reasoning.

87
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.260
You might instinctively perform inductive reasoning by checking against your own

88
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.830
experience,
but there are even more methodical approaches

89
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.430
we called valid and true deductive arguments sound.

90
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.010
When we come across inductive arguments,
it's preferable to talk about cogency.

91
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.060
A cogent argument is valid and has probable premises.

92
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.430
I've thrown around the words true and truth.
If you're like most of us,

93
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:46.090
you intuitively feel you have some understanding of what those words mean.

94
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.170
The difference between deductive and inductive thinking may have raised a few

95
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:53.140
issues,
but let's tackle the issue of truth straight on.

96
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.300
Digest each one of the following questions and use them to get a broad view on

97
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.370
different perspectives of truth in logic and philosophy.

98
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.220
Is this statement true within the lines which is consistent with and doesn't

99
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:09.140
contradict other true statements?

100
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.000
Is this statement true when it corresponds to something in the real world,

101
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.250
Ken,
certain statements be asserted as true in and of themselves,

102
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.310
even self evidently truth than deductively follow from these assumptions.

103
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.030
Is this statement true when it proves to be useful or practical?

104
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.680
Is this statement true when enough people argue or belief that it is true?

105
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.810
It's truth.
Not An actual property of a statement at all,
but something else,

106
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.150
Ken true or the truth ever be predicated in a meaningful nonredundant way?
Hmm.

107
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.830
Whatever your intuition,
what do you make of my coffee is a food argument.

108
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.400
Do you think it sound in the next video,

109
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.480
I'll share a perspective on the logical fallacies and take another look at that

110
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:56.900
argument.
