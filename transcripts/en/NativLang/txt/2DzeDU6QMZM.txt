Speaker 1:          00:00          Some languages have freakishly long words. Hawaiian driver's licenses have literally chopped off people's names. When ancient comedians spelled out this mystery meat dish and German words can get so hefty that even when they lost their longest one in 2013 it hardly left a dent. So what's going on and these words and just how long can a word get? A couple of years ago, I was living the life chained to a desk, 10 hours a day, working weekends, taking lunch breaks to go snorkel with turtles in the reef. Oh, did I not mention I was chained to a desk in Hawaii, so I had a good swim and I'm walking back and I must have zoned out on the scenery, eve singing with the birds or something because somewhere I took a wrong turn and now I am face to face with the street sign that never quits. Seriously, those letters went on forever.

Speaker 1:          00:50          If you're a normal human in this situation, you know you're lost. You turn around and you walk the other way. But language nerds, we drop our ice cream and sit there mesmerized by phonemes. Oh wait, you think a lone male goes wandering the streets looking at ice cream cone? That is creepy. No, we'd shave ice. The kicker though is if you pop open a Hawaiian dictionary, you won't find these forever words. In fact, most terms, we'll look downright short. So where are the extra letters coming from? Hanging out with me long enough. And you'll hear about Pacific island taboos in Hawaii. The word is couple. Oh, and there are some intriguing copper stories, but that's for later. So keep capule. But now go and grab this sounds hollow, which my grammar book calls a causative, smashed that onto Capua and you'll get whole. It'd be make something holy or cause to be taboo.

Speaker 1:          01:37          But these affixes only bias a few characters and they give me grammatical headaches. So no big wins here besides most Hawaiian grammar is done with separate little words called particles. And if you thought dissecting word beasts was a pain, here's your chance to tame a bunch of little scurrying word insets. So beautiful though. But what's better than taking your base word and growing it by sticking on some appendages. Adding another base word. This is called compounding. Edit a you some serious extra letters. What she got got a brain. How about a lightening brain dumb. Here's some Pele dog trigger fish. Why not a blunt pig snout trigger fish. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:22          pressive word building Hawaii. So then it's Hawaii home to the longest word ever. It is not. What about German or Greek from earlier? Same strategy. Compound compound compound. No record breakers. They're either, unfortunately the award goes to Durham role, a master compounder, extraordinary. A 16th century writer, Fetal Mulamba. She used compounding in her sand script masterwork in which there is an entire chapter devoted to basically just saying, so this guy pass through a part of Tamil Nadu but she gushed over that region. I mean she really laid it on thick one. Just one of the litany of flowery Sanskrit words she use to describe the place contains dozens and dozens of compounds, and that is how a sense grid compound made the Guinness World Records for longest word. And we having a moment here is that thought crossing your mind to like, theoretically, couldn't we just keep adding and adding hyphenated compounds infinitely. Hope you're right. Kind of unfair then, Huh? If that's how we're playing this, fine. It's a hyphenated verbal arms race. The thing about words like these is they don't really get used. Truth is, even with compounding, Hawaiian and German and even Sanskrit aren't winning any average word length awards around the world. Languages where people actually use long words and nearly every single sentence, oh, they build words very differently. She'd come back to that sometime. Stick around and subscribe for language.
