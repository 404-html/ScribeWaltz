Speaker 1:          00:09          This is the last lesson in the grammar of words where we're going to explore some of the properties that don't become apparent until we put multiple words together, but that are still often reflected in the form of words. Remember that this entire time we've been concerned with form morphology. So let's consider for properties possession, modification, agreement, and government. Let's stick with those four for now. Starting with possession, it has a fairly descriptive name. You can probably guess that it tends to deal with one down possessing another now, and that's the gist of it. In English, we show possession by adding an apostrophe s suffix or clinic to the Noun that is the possessor and placing that noun before the noun that is the possessed. Now an example would make this clearer John's car or the dog's bone. Both of these examples use the aloe morph of the apostrophe s morphine to show possession.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Other languages show possession in other ways. For instance, the romance languages used periphery assists. So does modern German in languages that have won a genitive case is perfectly fine for showing possession. So for instance, in Latin [inaudible] [inaudible] would be the girls dog. And in that instance we do the reverse of English in the romance languages. A pair of frosted construction developed that replaced the old Latin construction. So you say the equivalent of the dog of the girl, and basically every romance language, let's move on to agreement. Agreement involves, yeah, there's one word matching the same property of another word. That's an awkward way to say it, but let me give you some examples. In Spanish, a masculine noun will be described by an adjective that takes a masculine ending. A feminine now will be described by an adjective that takes a feminine ending. We sum that up by saying that the noun and the adjective agree.

Speaker 1:          01:59          The adjective agrees with the Noun. That's a case of agreement. The same thing happens in English between subject nouns and verbs. The word talks agrees with He. So we would expect to say he talks, but not I talks or you talks. So talks agrees with the third person, singular subject. That's another case of agreement. The verb has to take a third person singular ethics to show that it agrees with the third person singular subject. Let's distinguish agreement from government. The traditional account of government has us look at the word that is governing. In other words, we look forward. That forces another word to comply with a certain property. That's another awkward definition, but let's move on to some examples. In English we have prepositions if they take a pronoun, in other words, if they govern a pronoun like me, we expect that the preposition is followed by an object pronoun rather than a subject.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Pronouns. In other words, the word accompanying the preposition must be in the object case. So I would say for me, but not for he. I instead say for him, I don't use the subject case Pronoun after the preposition for or any preposition for that manner. I use the object case, so we say that prepositions English governed the accusative case of pronouns or the object case of pronouns. It's very important to notice the government applies to verbs as well. If I say I saw him. The verb. See here in the past tense saw prompts us to use an object case pronoun him rather than another subject case Pronoun. That's another example of government. Contrast this with agreement. Agreement matches a property equally well. Government pushes a word to have a property that the other word doesn't have.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Now let's talk about modification. When an optional word is added, that changes the meaning of another word. It modifies that other word, adjectives and adverbs are the main modifiers. In English, we have an example like the gray cat ate dinner in which gray is an adjective that modifies cat. You can see that if we remove gray, the cat's still makes sense. Adverbs work similarly. For instance, if I say the rabbit runs swiftly, swiftly modifies how the rabbit runs, we could just say that the rapid runs, the extra material isn't necessary, but it does add something. It modifies the action. Notice that these properties start to push us away from looking at the form of words. We're already talking about the arrangement, the order of words and sentences, and with that you're ready to move on to the grammar of sentences. I'm glad you stuck with me throughout this series and thank you for learning.
