Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world and hello people of Native Lang. I'm Jessica from comp Tom and I'm so excited to be a guest here talking about the intersection between language and code. I'm also really excited to be here at Youtube Space New York. There are amazing cameras. The super talented crew. You even get to see me dance can laugh at it. Comment. All right, let's get down to business and find out if computer languages even count as languages. I think their new spoiler alert. I am so jealous right now. I just found out that 10th graders like Sally are gonna Start getting foreign language credit for learning to program games on their iPhones. No slugging through years of conjugating Sarah and a star like I had to do. But you know Sally's mom, she's a, she's a bit iffier about this because she says that programming languages with all the curly braces and weird semi colons and strange Matthew symbols are nothing like a foreign language. Is She right? Is Matthew looking code like this really a language language.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Welcome to come chomp the only show on the Internet where we crack jokes in binary zero one one zero one one zero m zero one don't get me wrong. I actually really enjoyed my time in high school Spanish. Maybe don't ask me to order a meal when we're out because you were most likely going to get the Cabeza. They cheapo. Sorry. Now I'm a programmer and I get to look back and wonder what I was learning Spanish. Was I really doing anything different than when I was learning to code? I mean in my code I use words. I use syntax to put those words together and I even use related languages and dialects. Oh, that's right. In programming, there are language dialects. It all sounds so languagey, but does it look languagey facts alert.

Speaker 3:          01:53          Woo.

Speaker 1:          01:57          You know it's going to be good facts because these are my good facts. Glasses, if you want it to. How do you think you could tell whether learning to program was like learning a foreign language. You could round up a bunch of programmers and just shove them into an MRI and scan their brains while they're reading code. And that is exactly what Yanet Sigmund and team did. Trudeau is guys, actually no, I'm a programmer and I really hate in close spaces. Don't put me in there. So let's say that you're a coder and you're holed up in an MRI machine and they show you this. What does it mean? Well let's read it together. I'm a program stick label Var one on the number 23 and another label of our two on the number 42 now pull out a label temp, but don't put it anywhere just yet.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Now take temp and stick it where of our one is then PLF var one and stick it over there with bar too. And you can now take far too and put it backward temp. After this whole run around, which number did our label var would end up on. That's right. We switched them. All right, this, this is kind of fun. I like reading code. Let's do another one. I'm a program too. So this is auto. Who wears the name tag word. Give me a switch to flip when I get the right answer and give that switched the name tag result. Start one counter counting up from zero and another one counting down from the end of the word as the first counter counts up and the second counter counts down, you go until you reach the middle of the word. And at each count compare the two letters and if they are the same, keep going.

Speaker 1:          03:36          But if they're different, flip that results which to false and stop doing everything you're done. Just tell us whether result is true or false. Did you figure out what this did yet? Come on. I know one of you language guys. Has it figured out? We just checked if auto is a palindrome. And for those of you that aren't sure, auto is, so what type of brain patterns do you think lit up when coders were reading code like this? Probably just the ones that deal with math right or totally wrong. It's the ones that deal with language and memory. Basically being a fluent coder looks a whole lot like being a native speaker. One, two punch. It's my upper cut or I don't know my job. Go out right now and demand foreign language credits for your programming smarts. If your goal is to teach someone to think in a new language, you pretty much can't go wrong with programming unless you're teaching basic.

Speaker 1:          04:28          You need to stop teaching the kids basic. It is not a good idea. Details to come later, tragic traumatic details, but you know, if your goal is to have a whole cultural experience to read Don Quixote and accidentally ordered the visitee Chico, it's not really something you can do and see. All right, I hope you'll spend a few more videos with this program are talking language. I'm Jessica from comp champ.
