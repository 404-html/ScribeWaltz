Speaker 1:          00:45          Let's add one more feature of romance verbs to persons, tenses and aspects. It's called mood. So far the verbs we've met gave us information about who performed an action and when they were all matter of fact about it, kind of tasks for you, seeing fantastic for you sang that kind of thing. We might even say that they all indicate who does what there in the indicative mood plain statement. Send questions, have indicative verbs, whatever the tents, contacting Latino, Qantas in Latino, such verbs ask for or provide information in a vanilla way. Did this happen? Yes, that happened. Is it? Yes, it is. These kinds of statements. It's account for so much of what we say in right, including most of my narration. What if the mood isn't so indicative?

Speaker 1:          01:48          Latin and romance verbs also mark actions as possibly contrary to fact. We're not necessarily the case. This is useful when you want hope, fear, doubt, need or recommending action. Continuing with my apparent fondness for the verb Cantata, compare one indicative form can Thomas to a subjunctive what containers as in sped at and teams she hopes that we sing. It's a matter of fact that she does hope. So that's in the indicative but we may or may not actually sing. So this second for this and the subjunctive, I slid a little word quoting there. It's the word for that in Latin and it becomes something like gay in nearly every romance language we use k to connect the subjunctive or to the verb that triggers the subjunctive as in hope that want that need, that recommend that and so on. So we did quote is followed by an indicative but spirit quote by a subjunctive notice the thematic vowel, it switches. This is a key feature that distinguishes indicatives and subjunctives. That's present tense subjunctive stuff. We can also use a past subjunctive this past door. Imperfect subjunctive is especially useful in hypothetical's. I beer in languages also developed a future subjunctive for uncertain future actions like when I will sing or if I will sing, which remains in Portuguese but not Spanish window can perish.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Western romance languages have conditional endings that work a lot like the future indicative ending, step attached. The verb for have to the end of an infinitive. These are fractions. Someone would do. The imperfect of have is used in France and Iberia.

Speaker 2:          04:31          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          04:31          The predicate of have is used in Italy.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Other languages including Romanian and Sardinian built phrases or use the imperfect indicative to get the same conditional meaning.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Imperatives issue a command. The basic idea is simple. Take the verb, add the thematic. Val got into some common verbs. Are you thinking shorter? Deek, Tara? Also plural, forms for ordering around a group of people via data. A negative command uses this subjunctive in Iberia. No one contests. The infinitive is used in Italy, northern Canada, in languages that use third person forms to address you politely like contact for both sings and you sir or Madam Sing. The subjunctive comes back into play for both positive and negative commands. Contact

Speaker 2:          05:49          content,

Speaker 1:          05:53          person number, tense aspect, mood. You now all the basic features of romance, verb endings. Next time it's on to helping verbs. Notably [inaudible] to have an aesthetic to be.
