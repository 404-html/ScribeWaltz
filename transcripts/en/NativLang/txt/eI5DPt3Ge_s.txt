Speaker 1:          00:00          Danish sounds odd, like a throat condition, like Danes are holding back a cough or maybe they got a potato stuck in their throats. Apparently. At least that's what everyone's telling me. But why? Why does Danish sounds so funny to people?

Speaker 1:          00:21          I recently explored how Swedes, Norwegians and Danes can all communicate without having to switch languages. But this wasn't fair and even some languages were more intelligible than others. The Internet eagerly pointed his finger at one language in particular. Danish did it. I posted a video and I'm told that Danish is a throat condition. I log into social media and I read about the potato in their throat. I go visit a discussion board and it's a strangled goose. A study tells me Swedish kids here Danish as uglier and stranger than Danes do Swedish. The sure some of this is banter and good natured teasing, but even taking it all with a grain of salt, he herring. I still have to ask what makes Danish sounds so funny. Maybe I could just add my own theory. I'll blame it on too much Danish butter in there. Crigler but no, this is native Lang.

Speaker 1:          01:14          So you already know what we're about to do. Sift through the history of Danish to uncover what specifically about its pronunciation makes it stand out. Now, Danish is notoriously hard to learn to pronounce. You'll hear me try, but somebody please back me up. It may feel okay. Travel back in time. Once upon a 1300 years ago, Denmark was speaking in Indo European dramatic language with a unique northern flavor, which we call old Norse. To them, it's the [inaudible] Tonga, the Dane tongue throughout Scandinavia. This is a time of unity. Everywhere you go, Norse sounds like Norse, but soon these Dame Tanger's grow restless and get upgraded to Viking status in the Viking age. Something we'll change. It starts in Denmark, uh, Dane, probably many Danes, but definitely this one decides I'm going to start seeing my vols differently, which leads east Norse to split away from West Norse. It's the start of a trend, the perfect setup for the rest of our story.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Hey everybody. Uh, there was another sound change in Denmark and at this point over a thousand years ago, we can officially call it Denmark, the Dane March. See this rune stone says, so the vikings settled down the Middle Ages settle in at this point, Scandinavia is a continuum of dialects that smoothly trace their origins to east and west. Norse. Oh and the too often forgotten old goodness on its own island were valid sometimes didn't agree with either Norse West or east. Officially though this is an era of Latin, not too much written Norse until Denmark decides to go medieval and ink this scanning and law thanks to scribal copying this law was available in multiple versions, including this awesome one in ruins. It's words show off another Danish change unstressed vowels are getting weaker. This is how you're nicely distinguished endings in Swedish and Norwegian. We'll all end up in Danish with uh, uh, uh, meanwhile the Hanseatic league is uniting to dominate the continents and Northern Coast, which brings a war and many new words from middle, low German or Middle Nether Dutch.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Also. Meanwhile, another change is happening in Denmark. Consonants becoming softer, like how to soften to Ah, in math too. Math, this is Lynn [inaudible]. It's a normal change. Just ask Spanish, but weirdly Danes do it. At the end of syllables, consonants and unstressed. Vowels are weakening, but stressed vowels are multiplying by count Danish, we'll end up with more distinct vowels than maybe any other language. Now, this is a Danish that's getting different. We're a Honda something, but on the sounds funny scale so far, I'd rate it a chuckle. So far. It's 1526 a Swede writes that Dane sound like they want to cough, turning words in their throats. Arriving in ringing. What is this? Throatiness we won't know for another two centuries before a Danish grow. Marian rights in the [inaudible] squint. Hey, at least my Latin works. Also bolt title. Well, this book describes how Danes pronounced many syllables with a very little hiccup, a little hiccup with a bold name. A punch shock or blast is a stove. This punch to the throat isn't one sound. It's sums up an entire process, a complicated process with multiple phases and a bunch of anatomy happening in your throat. It's not on every syllable either. These don't have it.

Speaker 1:          05:23          These ones do. So yeah, it's been called creaky cough like, and let's not forget a constant stream of tiny hiccups. And it is crucial if you ever went to master that genuine Danish accent at the very moment, this author's writing about hiccups. There's another sound change in Denmark this time for once though it's not danishes fault. Danish preserved a trilled Norse, but now throughout France and Germany, a new ar is spreading a dramatic worth its own story. The so called guttural, ah, instead of a front of the tongue trill, it's a back of the mouth. Ahh, Denmark cut a bad case of this bug whose symptoms include turning words like as into this third results isn't even throw to your Danish. We're almost there almost because they have all the rights sounds in Copenhagen, but Scandinavia is still a rich tapestry of dialects. Sweden will keep its many variants, including a Swedish side form of goodness. In Norway. There's still no single spoken Norwegian, but back in Denmark, the old dialects, some of which never even had that stood will witness one last change. Traditional dialects. We'll mostly vanish. We end up with nearly all of Denmark speaking one language, a language with the simplest grammatical endings in Scandinavia. We can consonants perhaps the largest number of vowels in the world and little hiccups in [inaudible], and that is how the Danes went from speaking north just as well as anybody to sounding amazingly on harp, oddly amazing. Stick around and subscribe for language.
