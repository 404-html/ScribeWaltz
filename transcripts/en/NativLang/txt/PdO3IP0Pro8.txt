Speaker 1:          00:05          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Texting.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Written language is just one of those things that's always been around. It's a natural way for you to use words. It's a gimmick, but there's something you've forgotten. It's understandable after all. It's been a very long time.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32          a long time since no one on the planet knew how to write.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Our story starts with the legend, the tale of thought. Often feminists. No, that's not a list. Beer hearing, soften, Themis south and Samis after the Egyptian God thought and Vince writing, he runs to Kink, famous to share this discovery, but to his Chagrin, the king isn't impressed at all. Looking down his nose, he starts pontificating on the destructive power of this new fangled technology. Oh, clever thought. This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of learners with the neglect of their memory because their trust and writing comes from strange external marks and not their own internal recall. The drug you've discovered isn't a memory enhancer, but a mentioning enhancer and you're offering students pretend wisdom not truth. This sounds strange. It's easy for you and your world full of writing to dismiss them as, but here I'm out. He brings you back to the early days of writing when it was the hot new thing and like many other inventions, not everyone was on board.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Okay, so let's say for the sake of argument, you don't want writing. What are the alternative technologies you could bust out your abacuses. They'll help with counting and doing complex calculations. Maybe you prefer icons, ritualized images that help you relate to culturally significant figures, events and attitudes. The Keith who is an amazing ink and information storage system using cords, colors and not, oh, and don't overlook rope memorization. Basic option, sure. But it's really useful in preliterate societies where sentences can be memorized and recited by the thousands. You're brain is bigger than you think. Perhaps you prefer a petroglyphs rock carvings with major cultural ties that may refer to nearby places or animals. Ooh, watch out writing. We're getting uncomfortably close. All of these inventions helped humans keep track of their thoughts. So what makes writing different? What's them as afraid of? Let's talk some ness embeddedness. These things are all embedded in minds. Tasks, rituals, events, cultures, rip them from those contexts and you rip their expressive heart thoughts. Drug doesn't come with so many strings attached. It will DM bed you letting you record any specific thoughts and letting future generations read it in any context. So human was famous, right? Is writing an unnatural intrusion or do you want to swallow thoughts, pill and see for yourself what we actually unleashed when we invented writing?

Speaker 3:          03:22          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          03:31          La France, 17,000 years ago. It's cold out and getting colder. Possibly dangerous too. This may be France and this may be the history of writing, but there's nothing for you here until you take shelter in a nearby cave and see how creative some of your ancestors really were drawing on their enlarging brains and a long prehistory of building ever more complex tools. These early artists took to etching and painting beautiful visual representations of the animals around them. These aren't words, they're not stories. They're pictures early. Pictures like these start to become very routine, not necessarily depicting the world, but marking and standing for things. A place to hunt, a place to eat. These are pictographs. The story gets sketchy here, but it's important to notice that pictographic symbols like these Petroglyphs, rock carvings weren't words. They weren't language, but they became more than personal and communal artistic expressions.

Speaker 1:          04:36          They became regular and repeatable, possibly mapping to specific things. And for that, these pictographs or in themselves, the fancy label of Prodo writing, many pictographs have an intuitive giveaway quality. They look like drawings of the things they represent. Draw me a human easy. Draw me a horse. Sure. A river. There it is. But how do you clearly and simply draw less tangible ideas like playing around or taking it easy or don't even think about it. Uh Oh, watch out for this major moments in the history of writing meet metonymy. This principled fellow lets you represent a general nebulous idea with the related pictogram or part of a pictogram or a pictogram combo that's pretty specific and obvious. Ancient stick human is a regular old pictogram. If you cut off sticks legs, you can get across the general idea of what walking, removing. What about a man leaning against a tree?

Speaker 1:          05:36          What's the idea here? Taking it easy. Resting. These are idiot graphs, symbols for ideas and concepts. In some sense, all of these drawings express ideas, the concept of a horse concept of a human, so they're all idiographic but with a little imagination and a lot of time extended idiot graphs. Let you've cut and combine basic pictographs to be far more expressive and abstract. Just when you're ready to grab that Chisel and get your pictographic and idiographic carving on someone more inventive than you comes along. Your pictures and ideas aren't enough for her. Gone are the days of Lascaux the world outside. This cave is changing. She says crops, cities, rulers, markets, and she needs a way to keep track of it all. She likes your icons. She can use them for goats and Potts fields and even long walks through the desert, but she has an incredible practical streak.

Speaker 1:          06:30          She takes those goats in those pots and starts to tally the items. She's recording one goat, she says. Then two goats, three goats for goats. Notice what she's done. These aren't simple depictions anymore. They're not just ideas. She's reading one word for each symbol. She's encoding language. Let's slow down here because it's hard to overstate the importance of this major moment in the history of writing these goat counts or words, symbols. Now, Loga graphs, pictographs can be visualized. Idiot graphs can be imagined, but loga graphs can be directly and consistently red logo graphics systems emerge and flourish and the early civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mexico, characters for people, animals, land crops, hundreds, even thousands of Loga graphs for everything under the sun and moon, including the sun and the moon. Even after all these millennia, if you squint hard enough, you can still pick out the symbol, scratching and weathered artifacts, bearing the world's early scripts, a Chinese turtle and Egyptian house, a Sumerian head, a Sumerian had eating bread, a Mayan Jaguar, and in each of these places, in all of these languages, these were red as words.

Speaker 1:          07:48          We know what these Loma graphs mean and we can put that meaning into words. The world is now in a race to fill itself with logo graphs, but which humans started this craze? Well, the Mezo American started writing more than 2,900 years ago. Some Chinese characters or at least 3,200 years old writing popped up and creat 4,000 years ago, but the two clear contenders, our Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian cuneiform, both a whopping 5,000 years old minimum. It's common to say that the Egyptian stole the idea of writing from Mesopotamia and just came up with their own glyphs. Common but not demonstrated for a while. Mana genesis made sense. This is the idea that one civilization was king of all of the writing. That writing started once in Mesopotamia where people pressed a stylist in a wet clay to make these wedge Kunis shapes, forms, cuneiform, so the monogenic this story goes, everyone else steals cuneiform and re skins it to fit their own needs. It's not a popular story these days. Given what we know about Chinese and especially Mezo American writing along with some very early

Speaker 4:          08:56          Egyptian fines, whoever's first in these early days of writing, all of the civilizations start manufacturing hordes of logo graphs. So many in fact that they unwittingly unleash an epic memory burden on budding look og refers from would be ancient scribes to beginning students of Mandarin. Chinese, do they really need this many characters to write? Surely there's an easier way.

Speaker 5:          09:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Say hello to this smart rogue who's about to solve your problem with an innocent mistake. His father has been counting sheep literally and he just asked his son to record a measly line in his budget. 10 sheep for uncle the son writes the 10 and the logo graph for sheep but uncle he pauses and scratches his head eager to play with his friends. He writes the character for ankle 10 sheep ankle. He hurries away without a second thought but don't take his invention lightly. If you've ever played fill in the blank or guessing games where you have to sound out picture words you've seen and used this principle for yourself but it's not just for quirky puzzles with funny so we've shortened the name for this is another major moments in the history of writing. The name for this is is rebuilt. This familiar language game lets you look beyond the meaning of a character and use it simply for its sound.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Son. Sounds like sun and by extension, perhaps soon and sewn loga graphs like the symbol for Sun could already be read his words. Now with the rebus principle in your pocket, look at graphs can also be read as sounds. This isn't just useful for getting ancient uncle his ancient sheet. Once as tech city planners finish building their stunning capital in the middle of a lake, the Venice of the new world, keynotes teeth, Lon, their scribes needed a weight of right it's name. They've been using what amounts to basic picture of writing. Since [inaudible] has a stone Tay and a cactus, naturally it's natural to write it with two fairly obvious glyphs. Then these become not just symbols, meaning cactus in stone, but symbols for the noises they noche de land, making them just as much Redis fun as those puzzles you solve as a kid and now you know the name for those.

Speaker 1:          11:15          You also know why there's a cactus on top of a stone in Mexico. His flag, it's not just for show. How alike does this sound like pronunciation have to be, which sounds can we chop off pit the Egyptians against the Sumerians? One more time. Egyptian hieroglyphs cut off the initial consonant or less often two or three continents from the original word Sumerians. On the other hand with their cuneiform, take whole syllables. These two paths don't just add some local flavor. Reversing out consonants doesn't just impact ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. It leaves a legacy for later spinoffs. The mentality, these are either red as Loga graphs or they stand for consonants. Cuneiform leaves at different legacy, completely unrelated languages. We'll spend thousands of years of borrowing and reborrowing cuneiform to write their own words, but each time the symbols are red is low. Good graphs or as syllables. Flexibility is key here.

Speaker 1:          12:12          Look at this Egyptian hieroglyph. It can be read as the logo graph for mouth and AA or as the consonant or this character. It could be read as the logo graph, meaning house or it could stand for the consonant per the two consonants and the Egyptian word. Conveniently in Egyptian, the little slashy below lets you know when it's a pure logo graph. The rebus discovery brings up the tension between meaning and sound. Is Riding phonetic or semantic? Is it about encoding the meaning of words or in coding? Speech sounds, the old logo graphs. We're fundamentally a meaning writing system. Sure. This sounds like ray in Egyptian, but what's crucial is that this is a logo graph for the word meaning mouth. Rebus writing takes a big step towards sound writing. This will come to stand for the continent or regardless of meaning. It may come as a surprise, but once discovered, sound writing doesn't asked, meaning writing, not at all. Indeed, early writers notice that phonetic writing brings up a problem, a problem you probably missed because of your comfort with sound writing. A problem that meaning writing can solve. Brace yourself. History, because Loga graphs are about to make a comeback

Speaker 1:          13:32          like all of the world's earliest writing systems. Chinese characters start out as symbols that stand for words. A Rice Patty, a person, a tree. These are logo graphs and they let you depict specific language pieces to write what you mean. But instead of requiring different characters for every word, the handy rebus principle lets you write other things that sound like the lower graph to write what you've say. Sure. You could use the reverse sounds like principal to write any sound in your language, but please consider this symbol and answer the question that follows. Does it mean son soon son or sewn? Oh my. Did rebus writing get you into a bit of trouble here. When we see this character, we could read it as a plain old logo graph according to its meaning or any of these rebus ways following gets pronunciation. Which one should you choose?

Speaker 1:          14:26          Think a bit outside of the jade box here and take the lead of this. Han Scribe. His solution is elegant. Don't choose one. Use both systems together. What's that behind his back? Is that a ho? Yeah. Major moments in the history of writing. So here's the logo graph for horse, but it also sounds the same as the word for aunt said. The rebus lets us write them both with the same Glymph confusing, not if you add the logo graph for insect next to the sound to like character. This says it's pronounced like horse, which it is, but that it's meaning has something to do with insect. You don't read the extra character. It's a meaning hint determining how to read the sound character, so it's called the determinant.

Speaker 4:          15:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:12          One more mandarin example. This logo graph means moon, which happens to be pronounced UAE using rebus. Writing Yay also means amputate your feet. Incidentally, the word key is pronounced the same way. Same problem, but nothing. A couple determinative can't fix. Add the determinative for metal to this character. Add knife to that one and let's leave the moon B because that's already what it means here. Again, the sounds like reading of a character gives you it's phonetic component. This extra logo graph clues you into its meaning. It's semantic component. Together they form a unit, a whole character with a clear meaning and a clear pronunciation. Determinitive are very common in Chinese characters, natively called Han Carrie.

Speaker 4:          15:57          In fact, since they hint at the characters route, meaning it's radix. Han determinitive get called radicals, bringing back the characters sun. It can be pronounced many ways true, but at a determinative,

Speaker 1:          16:11          a silent helper character and you can quickly narrow down, it's meaning these extra determinitive avoid ambiguous readings. Which one is the sun in the sky, which is a father's son, which one means soon too easy. There's something else to learn from this quiet scribe. He's using radicals to clean up some ambiguity, but even he knows that context matters. He won't spell everything out for you every time. Sometimes this character means for as in this is for you. Other Times it's the verb supply. He's balancing this tension in the history of writing between what's easy on the reader, who needs more information to interpret the words versus what's easy on the writer, who typically knows what he means when he's writing it. Plus hand cramps. The choice of leaving in or leaving out helpful information isn't simply about clarity and laziness. It's a static throughout the history of Chinese calligraphy from Oracle loans to the rough cursive script. Stylistic choices are made not just semantic and phonetic choices. Seeing through the calligraphers eyes you can find in the history of writing not only a vision of what words and sounds look like, but where words and sounds go and where they stop.

Speaker 1:          17:25          When it comes to aesthetic choices and Han characters, none is more fundamental than the decision to arrange character components in blocks. Bonus note, this is definitely not the only time in history that writing gets organized in blocks. So this radical sits on top of this phonetic component in a block making up one whole character. The character for flour, the idiographic man plus tree, a man leaning a tree has two components sitting side by side in a block and they're the character for rest. And here's one tree and its own block, two trees meaning woods and three trees for forest. Aesthetics aside, what would happen if we took this sounds like principal a step further and made writing about the sounds is isn't that a better solution to our scene, son sown son problem. And one that doesn't make us memorize tons of characters.

Speaker 3:          18:18          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          18:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:23          Am I a stone worker? Etches elaborate rows of characters onto a stele. A tall stone brought in from far away. That's now standing straight up in the middle of the city. The characters he's carving. Look more like detailed pictures than writing, but don't let that fool eel take a look at this block. It means mountain, but it's not. Although the graph standing for mountain, it's not a rebus symbol for think of a word that rhymes with sheep mountains. It's actually a block of two sound symbols that spell the word [inaudible]. The Mayan word for mountain. That's great for climbers, but chocolate lovers may instead prefer to sampled these three symbols that together. Spell the word cat. Cow Cocoa. There's a nifty shortcut here. This bit doesn't even mean car. It's actually a syllable multiplier or iteration mark, if you want the fancy name.

Speaker 7:          19:12          Sure.

Speaker 1:          19:13          I think you're being watched over there in the jungle. Maybe not.

Speaker 7:          19:21          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          19:24          Major moments in the history of writing both of these Maya glyphs, combined syllable characters into blocks to write words. This is full fledged sound writing. These are Loga graphs that happened to be read as sounds. They are sounds, sounds capable of writing any syllable and the language in a full syllabary like the classical Maya script. There are separate characters for just about every possible syllable in the language. No longer must do invent new word characters you can make do with a much smaller set of syllable characters. Nice, but syllable writing comes with its own set of problems. Here's a cliff that's quite useful around these parts. Jaguar, the where does actually belong, but have you noticed something about the Mayan syllabary consonant plus bowel, continent plus bowel, more consonants plus more vowels. All of these syllables, Indian vowels. How in the world are you supposed to write the lump in Balaam, shifty scripty syllabi.

Speaker 1:          20:25          Dairies have grappled with this problem and settled on two solutions. One, leave out the final letter. Just ignore it. The term for this is under spelling because you're not fully spelling the word and it's a good solution because you know ignoring your problems makes them go away. Option to spell the last letter with an extra syllable. They use a syllable that just repeats the last bowel so that we know we can just ignore the final vowel. This gets called the echo vowel. Mayan likes number two a lot. So the cow is Kakoa. Well, because times to Wa wheats, the mountain is actually, we'd see. And your new pet Balaam is spelled Bala Ma. Cross out the echo vowels and the words practically read themselves. Your new friend pulls you along to show you another project. He's working on an Amati Codex. That's a paper book. Yes, he has paper and yes books, but that's not what's got him excited.

Speaker 1:          21:28          He folds open the book he's working on maybe to share new ideas. No, to brag about how inventive and potentially efficient his writing system is. Know for his people. The invention of the new wasn't about ditching the old. He shows you how creative he's been with the characters you learned. He shows you a mountain and calls it weeds and then a Jaguar and calls it Bilam Loga graphs. Wait a second, you stop and ask him, which is the correct way to write belong. He writes Balama. You ask him to write it again, and he writes the logo graph, but with the syllable and again, but he writes the logo graph plus two syllables. He smiles mischievously. They're all below them. This is what he's proud of. He can write the same word, even the same syllable in different ways and combinations without repeating himself creative, but his use of logo graphs plus syllables or calls.

Speaker 1:          22:26          The tension between sound writing, meaning writing meaningful, determinative, helped us choose the right pronunciation for our rebus character. And My loga graphs can still do that, but the helping hand goes both ways. The syllabary can also clarify the sounds you should make when you've read a lower graph. Here's the character Jaguar, but at a couple extra syllable hints and you make it clear that we're meant to read this glyphs as Bala Ma minus the echo vowel. So Balaam, these are phonetic compliments, pronunciation clues, sitting comfortably alongside logo graphs. If that's all too complex. Just remember that you can write everything in syllables, but before you have time to settle into this land of Balaam and Cacau to practice those syllables, a sandy wind starts blowing in from the east. Uh, familiar reminder from a far away land where even more dramatic changes are about to shape the future of writing.

Speaker 1:          23:31          Even in these ancient times, Egyptian monuments have been sitting and weathering for thousands of years on their great murals and pillars. You find rows of little pictures, sorry, not pictures. Hieroglyphs sacred symbols, but despite appearances, this isn't some mysterious, very iconic picture writing. It's consonant one continent signs, two consonant signs, three continent signs. Oh, wall of consonants, plus a sprinkle of logo grass for determinitive. It's not that Egyptian was a harsh bowel lesson, desert of a tongue. It's simply did not write it. The bowels. Imagine if you wrote this way, would that work? And then imagine if you could add in Loga graphs to make sure you've really got your point across. Imagine you wrote like that and you're thinking with hieroglyphs too difficult, fine off to the caves with you where you toil away with ancient miners on the Sinai peninsula,

Speaker 1:          24:30          you and your fellow miners would find it handy to leave messages for one another, but there's no time for deep studies of rows. A fancy hieroglyphs in here. You need to keep it simple. If you want another major moments in the history of writing, your characters look like scratchy, rushed version of those glamorous Egyptian symbols, but they're meeting doesn't matter anymore. Nothing but consonants and the same symbol for the same continent every time. Take this character in Egyptian, it means house. The Semitic miners are calling a house. A bet across any or top sounds suggest that you can just take the first letter of a word like the Egyptians had already been doing with much of their continent writing. You end up with a letter for your sound bar. Do the same thing with water, which the Semitic speakers or calling them, and you now have an mm sound with a couple dozen elegant simplifications.

Speaker 1:          25:25          You create a simple, reliable list of consonants. An alphabet and you've given generations of future children the joys of reciting their abcs. Actually at this point in history there Abg D's sometimes called an object or ob God because who needs that wishy washy? See when you can just use an at k after a long hard day of mining an etching, you turn to find that someone's been watching you this whole time. She's a trader, a Phoenician merchant who knows a good thing when she sees it. She's already made major cash and the paper business where they turn tufty stocky, swampy Egyptian per pirates into flat ink. Couple sheets of paper. She rushes back home to Phoenicia and smirks. Think of the advantage she has keeping track of whatever anyone else tells her just by remembering about as many characters as she has, fingers and toes. All the kings can keep their up two's, hieroglyphs and their stone monuments. The future of the Mediterranean will belong to alphabets and paper writing is going portable. She uses this newfound alphabetic leverage to turn a huge profit across the entire eastern Mediterranean, leaving people inspired to adopt and adapt her alphabet wherever she goes. All of this

Speaker 4:          26:51          and she doesn't even write you a thank you card. How hard could it be? Writing is easier than ever. It feels universal like writings here to stay for everyone, but there's a peculiar quirk that's easier to spot. In hindsight, you and your mining crew, we're communicating in a Semitic language, Venetians, a Semitic language. All of these friendly shades of the Phoenician alphabet were being used for languages that sounded similar and worked much the same way. Even Egyptian,

Speaker 1:          27:19          no, no Semitic language itself is at least a distant relative of the Semitic languages with a similar personality. This continent, alphabet is being tested in easy waters, but history is shaking things up. Who are merchant friend comes back for your help. She needs you to deliver your alphabet to a very different people living along her trade route. What will happen when the alphabet gets leaked outside of the family?

Speaker 1:          27:51          Grace, no, not that Greece. Greece. Before there was a Parthenon, a stern old man in a trademark. Sporty Toga seems a bit on edge as he glares at the pirates sheet clutched in his hand. Can you see? You try to shrug off his outburst, but he can't let this go. My friend, my friend, he recounts how 500 years before he was even born, when the walls of Troy still stood, the Greeks had a writing system of their own. It was one of those more elaborate syllabary plus logo graph types. But that script had come and it had gone. The new Greeks were people on the rise, but I know literate people on the rise that people looking for something new, something great. And this alphabet thing seems great almost. He calls over his close friends. The Phoenician consonants are useful. He can seeds. But why these extra characters for huffing, coughing and clearing your throat.

Speaker 1:          28:50          These are a barbarian sounds. Greeks have no need for them. And what about the voicing noises like and Ooh, how to write them? Huh? So much extra yet so much missing. What a mess you've tried to explain, but they laugh it off here. I fixed for you. He says, see, he was going to ditch the barbarian letters, but he had second thoughts and it struck him. Why not use these on Greek sounds for vowels. The one you call a left, ignore the throaty catch at the beginning. It's, ah, take that, hey, but ditch the huh and we're left with a valley. A, you send up that tight Wa and wow and it's developed. This isn't just a small correction. This is a powerful major moments in the history of writing. He's fundamentally shifted the way the alphabet functions. It used to be just the consonant suggesting the pronunciation of a word.

Speaker 1:          29:53          Once you recognize the word, the job's done. But Greek spelling isn't merely about writing recognizable words. It's about matching letters to sounds. A new principal has just emerged, perhaps even a new goal. One sound, one character. You suspect that he's not even aware of the impact of his discovery as he tells you to drop everything and come enjoy some dinner and dancing. Hippy, silly. The party goes on and on so long that your new friends don't even see what's happening beyond the walls of their city state. This consonant vowel alphabet, this pronunciation writing. It's spreading inspiring new alphabets to the east with flavors like Armenian in cyrillic popping up out west in Italy, the Tuscans, the Etruscans borrow it and they pass it on to the Romans. The Romans burst down and splatter it among the Celts cinder manic peoples, and eventually the world. Such a visual rainbow of variations and yet they'll all stick with the basic principle of writing a character for each sound, consonants and vowels. Finally, you see your writing system in this story, your alphabet, all because a handful of submit symbols got mistaken for Greek vowels, but before you get over confident, know that the history of writing doesn't stop here. This isn't the be all and end all, not even close.

Speaker 1:          31:19          You're back in old Phoenicia where it turns out the Greeks aren't the only ones looking to buy a vowel. Your contact in town is still your merchant friend of me who reminds you of how she traded your continent, alphabet across the ancient world. That object spread to every language with even a passing resemblance to finishing. Every town from here to Carthage has some version of her object spot. The Egyptians, those stuck in their way. Traditionalist initially, these submit it, speakers loved it, they were proud of it, but the days are turning to years and that love grows cold. They grumble that they're stuck with these continents. Just consonants clamoring for vowels. They get desperate and grab a few characters to stand in for a long sound. Take a look. This symbol is originally the stop between, ah, ah, this one's a y. Uh, yes sound, and this is a word, but they're about to become not these things.

Speaker 1:          32:12          Thanks to major moments in the history of writing. This moment hits you twice because it brings up both an innovation specific to submitting scripts and a more general principle that kind of bins the rules of the alphabet game first, it's worth reiterating that object writing systems are viable ways to write and read a language they work, but with one obvious shortcoming, those missing vowels can create ambiguous situations. But what if instead of every vowel, we just had a few helpful hints that suggested the presence of certain kinds of vowels. Take this letter. What actually they called it. Wow. Wow. Now imagine that we keep using it and words that have the sound what? But we also extend its use placing it between continents for the similar enough foul sound. Ooh. In the old op job you'd have to write soon. And son with the same characters.

Speaker 1:          33:03          S plus in everything else is vowels and we don't have those. But suddenly our extended work comes in handy. Son Doesn't have that OOO sound. So it's still s plus in, but soon does. So we add in the WWE do the same thing with Ja, which can double as a long I and this quirky catch in your throat. Pause between uh oh a left, which can double as a long. Ah, and you end up with three handy of suggestors, the mattress Lectio, these helpful mothers of reading that show up in Aramaic, Hebrew, Arabic and Syriac. But these mothers don't leave their continent net's behind. They still double as consonants. The object traded the ambiguity of a vowel. This existence for new kind of ambiguity. Depending on context. Each of these mattress may be a continent or it might be a vowel one character, multiple sounds.

Speaker 1:          33:54          This is a huge trend in alphabet. Why invent new characters when you can reuse an old one? Repurposing continents for vowels here and there won't satisfy everyone. These bickering scribes aren't content with mattress lectio Giannis. They're not just trying to tell son apart from soon. The bickering scribes are bickering over how to read one of their most treasured sayings. One says that it's such a fine point. You wouldn't understand unless you were incredibly well versed in his language, but he makes an analogy for you. Write the word news in a continent only alphabet. It's in ws. Fine. Now imagine that someone comes along with their fancy consonant vowel hybrids and spells the word nous in w s hmm. Wait a second. He shows you a cheat sheet he's been keeping. It's so easy. He says, pointing out the little dots and dashes above and below letters to keep his vowel straight.

Speaker 1:          34:47          Put them here for an awe there for an a. You can even add them below one of the long vowel things. If you need to distinguish, say an eat, nobody's confused. That's it. He won't tolerate the vagueness any longer. Effective immediately in all important text where clear reading matters. Everyone's to use this method. And so for generations, scribes would mark bowels above and below the consonants, writing bowels in what was once a consonant, only alphabet, but as much as the pious and students whereby they're Dadi vowels. Modern Arabic and Hebrew speakers stick with the simple consonants plus the extended consonant vowel mothers. The optional helper dots get thrown in like a life preserver for struggling learners or careful text, but grownups don't need them anymore.

Speaker 1:          35:39          The spice market in India, the hooded figure in front of you, apologizes for the kidnapping. He needs her help. He explains that his land has taken part in history's most elaborate and rigorous memorization exercises instead of scribes. They had recitations. These weren't retellings of campfire stories. These were whole libraries of knowledge handed down for generations. He says his name is [inaudible]. This is his land and he is king after a bloody and violent war. He had a change of heart and now has, but one singular focus to spread his message. A lot of tolerance and compassion throughout the land. But he doesn't want to use the mouth to ear memorization ways of the oral tradition. That's for old texts and old ideas. No, his vision is to install massive pillars around his empire. Each one engraved with his list of edicts. This he explains is where you come in.

Speaker 1:          36:34          See He's been keeping tabs on you as you roamed the land of the submitted odd jobs and he really likes this crazy consonant alphabet idea. He'll take it, but he also appreciates the whimsical simplicity of accent continents with vowel marks. Oh, and he doesn't want to have to write the vowel if it's just a short, uh, his language is full of those. So he'll write funnel something like this with these built in syllables, but wait, it's not funnel that final or is in a separate syllable. He needs a way to write, just bear consonants to tell his past, apart from his pasta. How with a simple hush stroke below the letter. Now he brags to you. His system is complete. Make sure you don't miss the stuff he's taking here. It's a major moments in the history of writing. Each of the character units fundamentally represents a syllable.

Speaker 1:          37:26          It just so happens that unless the vowel and not syllable is a short aw, the val gets added on, onto or below or beside the consonant character on their own. The base characters contain that dummy vowel, uh, like Po. But you can take that and modify it with any vowel you like. Certain bowels go in certain places like e to the side or Ooh below. So in India, characters or syllables, but unlike a full Cilla Barry, you don't need a completely separate character for each separate syllable. And all characters give consonant plus vowel information. But unlike a full alphabet, you don't line up sequences of consonants, plus vowels, consonants, plus vowels. The hybrid combination nature of the system earns it. The name Alpha syllabary combos are built into this system. Paving the way for over a thousand ligatures commonly linked characters in the Alpha Ciliary. Sure. Other writing systems developed ligatures and their calligraphy, but the indic Alpha salivary welcomes them naturally as it's past all around this entire slice of the world up to Nepal and Tibet down the coast to Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and beyond.

Speaker 1:          38:33          The script keeps updating its but continues to capture consonants and vowels accurately like an alphabet and to write those vowels, consonants in syllable units like the syllabary, even completely unrelated Alpha Cilla. Barry's seize on this same idea. This is the Ethiopic symbol for ma. This one reads May and this is Moo. This is law Ley and loop. Now that you understand that was still a berries. You must answer this next question if this symbol sounds like blah. How do you write bay and Bu in Ethiopia? This is your Gig is ABCDs. The Abu Gita looks different but works much the same way. Your characters have never looked so different even after the Greeks and Romans took them over. Maybe it's this dizzying variety of writing systems or maybe thoughts. Pill is starting to wear off.

Speaker 1:          39:32          Another time, another king. This time in a Korean palace, he presents himself as king. Say, John, as you get a grip on your surroundings, you began to tell him of your journeys. Yet with the sweeping gay is the king books right past you. You've been out for a very long time. Over a thousand years, the world has come so far and the scripts you once knew have to, he reminds you of the old Chinese local graphs and sound demeaning combinations. Those are still useful to his court to appoint. You See, Chinese has these nice word units, one after another, but Korean he boasts has these elegantly complex words with different pieces and endings. Fitting Chinese writing to Korean grammar hasn't been easy. He tells you other people across the seed who've gone through a similar struggle. The Japanese simplified Chinese characters by turning them into a fixed syllabary, which they now use alongside the Chinese characters.

Speaker 1:          40:27          So they have these syllable characters and these thousands of Han characters. They used the Han characters for the meaning heavy components. They'll tabulary terms. Then they use the syllabary to write little grammatical words and word pieces or new vocabulary words that don't historically have their own Chinese logo. Breath such a complicated system. Gentlemen. The king has an almost puzzle book like he's holding back a punchline. He recounts how an Old Japan women wrote entire books using only the syllable characters because riding with the traditional Han characters was seen as the masculine thing to do, but he knows of another land. He's heard exotic tales of the West where people write out all of their sounds. Logically, he pauses. He can't quite grasp this himself. You snicker as you think back on how you saw the alphabet develop with your own eyes and your journeys, you would know.

Speaker 1:          41:18          So you sit down and show him how to write every vowel and consonant with the alphabet, a couple dozen shapes, and you can write any sound. You smile and think so simple, but he lets out an unimpressed. Sy. Why do all the characters so different, so haphazard? I mean you make fun and VA by putting your bottom lip against your top teeth. The only difference is that your throat vibrates. When you say VA, he quizzes you. Why do you write fuck and fuck? And he goes on interrogating you. What about, but why does it look that way when it's just taking the VUS sound and saying it through smacked lips seems you underestimated the king. He doesn't want any old alphabet. He wants a writing system that shows the various features of sounds that the sound is made in your throat against your teeth, made with your lips and so on.

Speaker 1:          42:08          He puts his brightest scholars to work, giving them the humble name of the hall of worthies, Ingo, the experts and outcomes and other major moments in the history of writing. They develop Korean Hungle, featural alphabet. Every syllable gets separated out into its own block. The syllables, consonants, and vowels will be written side by side within that block, each consonant and vowel letter inside that block will be shaped according to its features. So here are the continents that get pronounced with the lips. See the similar lip shape. Here's God, and here's cut again, similar sounds similar shape. The featural alphabet was so simple and straightforward forward. One of the king's historians almost dared people to learn it. If you're smart, you can learn it in one morning. If you're a fool, it'll take you 10 days. Not everyone's jumping on the Hungle. Easy train community accessible writing, father's traditionalist who skip out on the innovation and keep using Chinese characters, fit it to Korean Honjo or hand characters even into the 19 hundreds still for the rest. Writing is easier than ever. It has its first drug star. It even gets its own holiday. Oh, writing. You've come a long, long way from pictographs. St a case.

Speaker 1:          44:05          The day that thougth invented writing, fabulous warned him that he discovered a drug that would make people lose touch with themselves. If you're still watching, you took thoughts, pill, and software yourself. The effects it really had. It started with visual depictions of the world. Pictographs signs for ideas and thoughts, idiot graphs than a transformation from picture writing to true writing with symbols that stand for words. Moga graphs using those words to sand for similar sounding words. Rebus. Then those sound alikes became syllable characters. Silod, Barry's continent characters, odd jobs and then consonant and vowel characters, alphabets or even consonant and vowel syllables, Alpha silver berries, and if things get really linguistic Salvey Alpha, that's become all featural characters grouped by their phonetic properties along the way, writing had to deal with the tensions and take sides. Should it represent meanings or sounds? Should it benefit the reader or the writer contained maximum information about every sound or just enough to recognize the shape of a word? Should it be flexible and creative or rigid and consistent? How do physical techniques shape it? Oh Hen who did it first, who did it best? Maybe you've learned to make some sense out of the chaotic noise of world writing systems.

Speaker 4:          45:21          Maybe you can appreciate it.

Speaker 1:          45:22          Some of the problems, each one solves the traditions. It captures the ambiguity's it creates or perhaps it's more comfortable just to close your eyes and wake up back at home. Looking at your familiar characters of your familiar writing system plastered across your favorite. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          45:37          websites still somehow you can't even look at that the same way. It's just one invention among many in the long history of this language technology we call fighting.

Speaker 8:          47:22          Okay.
