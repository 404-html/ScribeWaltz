Speaker 1:          00:01          Time ticks forward any English, but did you know in Mandarin earlier is up and later is down or that the UK Tech Maya have no word for before or after these sound like the kind of fun facts you share with a friend and then move on. But for linguists, time is at the center of a major debate. Are there languages out there were time just doesn't work like we think it does. There's a linguist who spent his entire career documenting and trying to understand one language, Hopi after four years of field work in Arizona on the third Mesa, surely he has real insights to share about every aspect of the language. And yet in this lung book he focuses on just one Hopi time, over 600 pages of Hopi time. With example after example of how just like English hope he has words for time, like later temporarily, the Hopi count days, they use terms like over there as spatial metaphors for time and their verbs have tenses.

Speaker 1:          01:09          They can mark the future with ne time, time, everywhere time. Okay, so the hope he can tell time, what's the big deal? Well, it must've mattered to someone because linguists and psychologists and people who never heard a word of hope in their lives grabbed the book and held it high as proof that time was universal for humans and then they cursed the name of warf. Warf was wrong. Warf was a charlatan. Warf was a con man. Oh fuck. What's the fuss? Whoever said that, the hope you don't think about the past, present, and future plus who's this wharf and YC getting picked on so much worth. What's a fire inspector, but one with a unique hobby Youdo as tech in languages. This curiosity led him to Sapir who took wharf under his wing. Just, Hey, I've got some literature that will blow your mind. See Hambelton Boaz taught us how different cultures subconsciously categorize the world based on language, but I think there's more.

Speaker 1:          02:14          I think people are at the mercy of language. We're not living in the objective world, man. We're living through our language. What an hod idea, but as worth turn to another Uto-Aztecan language. She started to see it. Hopi seemed so on European to him in the way it handled time. There was no substance called time and no timeline that could be cut and counted. No space as a metaphor for time as if you could move through time, not even a past, a present, or a future tense. The more worth studied Hopi, the more he concluded that the Arrow of time isn't something that exists in our objective world. Instead, we think about time this way because we speak average European. The Hopi don't share our concept of time because they speak Hopi. How do the Hopi live without tense? Well, for warf, Hopi time is about cycles.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Rituals, mental preparation for key events. Above all, they have no objective time. Sapir died at age 55 and warf joined him a couple years later, age to 44 but his ideas were captivating. Do people think about time differently in different languages? Does your language shape your concept of time? Does the language you speak to determine whether or not time even exists for you? These claims from weak to strong got the Nickname Sapir wharf, which I often hear pronounced saper wharf. Hopi time became it's posterchild and an ever growing big fish tail. Hope he is innocent of a category for time and no worse. Our concept of time would be in comprehensible to them better yet the reason you have clocks and watches is because you aren't Hopi and my favorite hobby time makes for better family therapy then the Aristotelian reality western parents are stuck in. So now do you see the power of the 600 pages spent vanquishing wharf and mainstreaming?

Speaker 1:          04:19          Hopi linguists had had enough. Many of them wanted to focus on what made language universal and in nature to all of us stop parading around Hopi as an exotic oddity. We all think the same way. We just express ourselves with a little linguistic flair. So then time is time is time. It's settled, not quite. dot.dot. Years after Hopi time, researchers claim that they'd found new evidence showing wharf was right about time. All along like this set of experiments playing on the difference between how English and Mandarin speakers you space to talk about time earlier is to your left and later to your right in English. But in Mandarin, things can get vertical. Earlier is up and later down. Even though these experiments were conducted entirely in English, native Mandarin speakers were quicker to answer simple questions about earlier or later after being primed with vertical tos. Well, native English speakers were faster after horizontal cues.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Thinking about time, it seemed was shaped by language. The masses were intrigued, myself included, someone passed me a link to it and my work inbox years ago, and I wasn't even working with linguists, but in the comments of my old video about warf, a researcher did mention having trouble replicating these results from what I've read since then, that commentary isn't alone still. It was just one of the many wharf like effects that kept making the news some from scientific tests in the lab, others from fieldwork on the ground. So in the central Andes, there's a language spoken by millions called Imada. In Aymara, you're Neda, your eye is in front of you and your keeper, you're back is behind you. That's normal. But this isn't when talking about time, the eye motto speak as if they face the past, but they have their backs to the future.

Speaker 1:          06:17          They even point behind their backs to gesture into the future. So their eyes are exactly where your eyes are, but their past is not where your past is rare, unique, but there's something else about I Mana and hoping at second glance, some linguists tell us both of them are best viewed as tenseness. Wait, there are timeless languages out there. What? Well kind of tense lists. It's not as odd as it first sounds. We already know of languages that are uncontroversially tenseness take. You could tech Maya. Not only are they missing a past, present and future tense. They even lack words like before until and after. How in the world do they talk about time? Well, strategies, complex strategies like context aspect. It could make a fun followup to dig into the mechanics of how Tencent's languages talk about time, but good luck proving any of this makes them experience time in a fundamentally different way.

Speaker 1:          07:25          You could, tech speakers do fine and experiments about linear time and any effects are subtle. See if you read the research and not the breaking headlines, strong ideas of language, determining time. Those are out. Any ongoing debates are about subtler influences in the end. Languages do talk about time differently, but it's harder to get speakers to behave differently based on their language. But I'll level with you. I get the sense of trivia about time and tenses was never the point. Hopi time became a mascot for a grander idea. Linguistic relativity, whereas Sapir put it, different societies live in distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached. That's an idea I suspect we'll run into again in the future until then. Stick around it. Subscribed for language.
