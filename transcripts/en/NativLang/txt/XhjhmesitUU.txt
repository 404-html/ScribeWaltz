Speaker 1:          00:44          Last time we looked at basic sentences and Volcker, Latin and romance. Simple sentences have one finite for which means a verb with person number endings. These contrast with non finite forums like this infinitive in romance grammar. A clause is a chunk of language revolving around one finite contests. VKC Library, Tata [inaudible] case. These are all clauses that you've seen

Speaker 1:          01:25          became, they say deacon quote, they say that God does Bna. You sing well, he can quote contest Beignet Dean kick, Qantas Bang [inaudible] Bay. These could Sean to be for, they say that you sing well, the mood of the second Ferb contrariness. This example will be subjunctive instead of indicative. If the first verb has a whiff of the counter factual about it. [inaudible] I want that you sing where you may or may not sing verses suck of contests. I know that you sing where you are definitely singing Romania and uses the word sunk to connect the two finite verbs and the verb after sa is always subjunctive. CouldN'ta she sings Fidel. I want video. Second day, literally I want that she sings.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Notice the structure of sentences like I want that you sing in romance in English. This is normally I want you to sing with an infinitive to sing. Why the difference? The subjects of the two verbs are different. Echo volume. I want to contests you sing, so they're attached with quotes or romance, quay or key, but this verbs in the subjunctive there that gives us the right sentence when the subjects of the two verbs are the same like Eggo volume and echo Canton. The second one's left as an infinitive. Hey, go Vallejo cantata and not ego volume. Oakwood Eiko Canto. So boy, you can tag your Schulty where you can diary. That's the difference between what to sing and want that somebody sing. But this isn't true of Romanian where two verbs with the same subject can still join [inaudible]. I want [inaudible], which literally means I want that I sing modal verbs are normally found before an infinitive with this finite plus infinitive structure. Most [inaudible], they'd be oak and Tati classical Latin had passive endings for verbs. Contact sings. But it is some, those passive endings didn't survive. But that doesn't mean the modern languages avoid passives. They've created other ways of expressing the same thing. Here's the one we've seen. If you recall as said, a with a past participle is to Cantata Tato.

Speaker 2:          04:42          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:43          as script too. Ilulissat Lewis script too. Extremely common in romance is the use of reflexive say with third person verbs. Contact. Well, you know what that means by now, sick. Untapped. Literally it sings itself for it is some scary bit. Say Scream. It literally it writes itself for it is written. The verbs number singular or plural matches the number of the subject. [inaudible] Cribbet the book is written. He loves Libra, SIS, grievant. The books are written this passive with say this heard across the romance speaking world from Romania to Portugal. A few languages have generic third person pronouns that can approximate a passive French on Shaunte. Romance in Santa Cleaver. French leans heavily on this way of forming the passive. We've run through a range of sentence types to give you a feel for romance syntax. We've now seen the basics of how nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and sentences work in vulgar, Latin and the romance languages. Thank you for taking the time to learn with me.
