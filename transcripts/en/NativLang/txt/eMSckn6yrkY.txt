Speaker 1:          00:08          I'm going to give you an idea of what a grammatical rule is by helping you to formulate a rule to explain it. Grammatical feature of English. Before we do this, I should bring up two more symbols that some linguists use when analyzing sentences. We've already seen brackets which can enclose phrases, another symbol as the asterisk which is placed before sentences that are judged not to be examples of a language and another is the question mark, but just placed before sentences that are judged as questionable. In the last lesson we saw that English speakers tend to use subject verb, object, word order in a statement like you were there, but verb subject, object ordering questions with the verb be like were you there? Let's come up with a way to describe how English speakers ask questions with the word be and sometimes with have compared to the declarative sentence he has done the work to has he done the work in both examples it looks like the verb and the subject invert the subject and the verb seem to switch places when you ask a question.

Speaker 1:          01:15          So let's try and formulate a rule using the concept of inversion to describe the situation in English and see how well it applies English speakers in for the noun phrase of the subject and the verb to ask a question that works fine for the example. Are you there? But how well does it explain the second example, has he done the work? In that case, our main verb is actually an auxiliary with the past participle. It's as done, but the whole phrase has done, doesn't switch, doesn't invert with the subject only the verb has does so we don't find that we ask has done he the work we asked, has he done the work? We realized that we don't move the whole verb phrase. We actually extract a verb from it's verb phrase and place it before the subject. Now it doesn't look like we're inverting anything because the subject now and doesn't end up inside the verb phrase.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Instead it looks like we're actually just extracting that one head verb and moving it before the, now with that in mind, let's formulate a new rule to describe the situation. Let's say English speakers extract the head verb from it's verb phrase and move it before the subject. Now to ask a question. Now we have a descriptive rule that seems to work for both of the examples we have at hand. So we're going to change our rural slightly to produce similar sentences, but the slight change we're making is a move toward imperative logic. Extract a verb from it's verb phrase and move it before the subject. Now this gives us a set of instructions that if applied to the declarative sentence produces the question as it's output. This be have asking rule will work pretty well until we get to an example like he will have done the work on Friday, we'd expect will he have done the work on Friday? But we get have, he will done the work on Friday. These rules are a work in progress. Then I hope you now have a handle on the basics of the grammar sentences and thank you for learning with me.
