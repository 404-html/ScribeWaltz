Speaker 1:          00:01          Celtic quiz for you. Does this Irish names start with the sound puck? The sound or the sound fun? Yeah. You knew it was a trick question, Huh? Me Indeed. Irish words can do something quite unusual. They can mutate. They're starting sounds. I'm busy piecing together the epic history of Ganga tugging at threads grasping for one that ties everything together. I'm noticing I barely have time for name drops. Protal Celtic, boom. Next. Oh boom, boom. Next mutation. Boom. No, no wait. Let's explore that one in its preliterate days about the most traumatic thing to happen to the start of Irish words was said. It's peas fell off and without this process today we'd be speaking of Pyre land so well, Rome said [inaudible] and potter. Irish has [inaudible] and I even Ireland's oldest writing system is missing a sign for that p but otherwise, this ohms script has neat syllables and beautiful inflected Celtic endings. Just a couple of hundred years later though Goy the Helga merged with a mystery. It was suddenly so different that it left. Link was stumped how Irish could have changed this fast from Owen out of the blue or the emerald green come manuscripts filled with mutations, mutations that Irish will never let go of. They come in two flavors. First soft. That's a flavor. Chezvous inition weakens letters into fricatives or even glides. Clen. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:48          Jess. Yes. To who some clinicians have changed since old Irish like ha and girl were once in the, we even lost my favorite lineation. Today's war was once more the old clothes settled on marking lineation with A. Dot. Nowadays, you plop in an H. Mutation number two is to literally darkening or eclipse. Eclipse automatically turns any voiceless sound voiced become, but the gut hook book, Gree, gree voiced consonants turn nasal border more Ganga [inaudible]. If you count like this book, you'll find a third mutation Hasper ration. This one's about Val's specifically adding h two vowels after some words that end in a vowel kind of breaks up the two vowels. Old Irish is but me, haze and Aiden, but the Hayden, what makes mutations this specially devious is that they're triggered by grammar. If you asked an old Irish scribe who's check this is, you better have known the difference between masculine, feminine, a cheque and plural, a JIC and modern Irish.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Oh yes. It keeps doing this. I Shah a chuck. I said, yeah, this happens. Good. Your muck means a son. Mk is a pig. You say amok, but unwork why? Because feminine some words triggering eclipse instead it bought us and milia clear every Florida you will be his bay too. But if I ask, it's unmade too. And if you won't me vate too with no word for yes or no mutations are a must. Where do these transfigurations come from? Recall that those early elegant grammatical inflections had eroded this often left old Irish, nothing more than a slender consonant to mark a meaningful difference. Mk, MK, Dune, Dune with its endings crumbling around it. Irish noticed something and just in time the very words that triggered these endings had also been messing with beginnings triggers ending an a vowel like the feminine article had been softening. The next sound on muck and wook triggers ending and a nasal naturally turned.

Speaker 1:          04:38          The next sound. Nasal Gallagher and Gallagher. Now with beginnings in place, triggers themselves were free to erode or even vanish entirely. Irish had evolved in new way to do grammar. When did this happen? Ask Welsh look, come has mutations too. Well then clearly these must be inherited. Part of their shared common Celtic ancestry. I'm told not. Instead, their parents gave them the tools. Time provided the problem. Each language came up with its own solution. So when you shout to pathetic remembered, you use the vocative of Fondrick. When you speak from the heart Omo cre, and when something's in Irish, it's Aigner stick around and subscribe for language.
