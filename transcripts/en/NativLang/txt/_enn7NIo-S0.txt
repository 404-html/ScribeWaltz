Speaker 1:          00:00          Rome fell in the year for 76. The microphone wasn't invented until the 1870s. That's quite a gap. And yet we still know how the old Romans pronounced their Latin. Prove it. Okay. Catholic school literature class. My teacher, his father, let's call him father f a fellow language had himself, father f has a much fuller experience bar than me. Respect it's first thing in the morning and that schoolrooms sunlight is barely starting to flip. The activation switches in my brain language. The words drift in from across the class. Consonants. Italian pronunciation up goes my sensor. One kids over there talking with the father best I can recall it went like this. So, um, how do we know what Latin sounded like? I mean, I always thought Caesar's quote was Venae [inaudible] but some Latin student told me V's were W's and sees where Kay's Ha, oh, come on.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Can you imagine any good Italian saying where any Wiki Wiki. Uh, I'm sitting there. Sure. This is wrong. Somehow. See, my first linguistic obsession was reading up on how Latin became the romance languages. So why was I suddenly speechless? Lee Tongue tied. Well, young self, it took me years, but I'm back to help. We think we know it's Caesar's Latin sounded like and that wasn't it. We know because well sometimes they told us quintillion was a smart guy from Roman Spain who moved to Rome, managed to survive the off the wall year of the four emperors and then founded a school of rhetoric also. He hated the letter k, so k I think shouldn't be used at all the letters. C keeps it strength before all the vowels. If he's saying see, always made a k sound, that means it didn't have that second soft pronunciation it does in English or Italian, but that's one grew Marian say so things could look different when all the evidence comes in, which is exactly what one check linguist claims about the letter r your Latin textbooks says it's a real, she argues it's a tap edit.

Speaker 1:          02:03          We're just going to have to piece together the evidence ourselves. Starting with ancient authors writing in good Latin. The first clue they give us is the alphabet, which was meant to fit Latin sounds. You hear that English. So when they wrote words differently, like on those unknowns and unknown, it's a face value hint that they said them differently, meaning that long, ah, which sometimes has this little apex doesn't sound the same as short up and double consonants don't sound like single consonants in the hands of Virgil, the epic poet, that CNC Alphabet is jammed into a precise structure, poetic meter. From that meter we can figure out which syllables are long in which are short, which helps confirm which valves are long and which ones are short. So some eyes, sorry, eas are longer than other eas, but go look for short. He on inscriptions and you'll find something interesting or won't find because it might be representing an a why.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Well, it makes sense if short he wasn't only shorter than long e but it also had a different sound, a sound closer to a uh, kind of, eh Romans left even more clues when they marched right into foreign language territory then got raided by Germanic tribes, linguistic rates. We're all taking words guys, what do you want oil? Bring me back from wine. I want a wall. Yup. Those are Latin words and bad accents and they make it look like versus where was at the time something we'd already be suspicious of from poetry and word pairs. So yes, good Latin was spreading the back home. The Roman rebel was busy turning it bad. Good Latin writers notice though and even included characters speaking the bad Latin, the sediment will goddess, especially for a good laugh, but bad Latin can still be good evidence down in palm pay before the tragedy, a random guy comes along and is the place to make sure we'd forever know that he stopped here with his brother.

Speaker 1:          04:01          He does something vulgar though. He drops the h in the word here. Ah, just a little mistake right later you find a very dusty, very old book full of cranky corrections telling you that the word for old is wet, too loose, not wet clothes to say [inaudible] not [inaudible] and [inaudible] Mata. Not No matter. Come on, people get it together. It looks like the pump papers weren't the only ones dropping their ages. These mistakes are an interesting kind of proof. I mean, you probably wouldn't beg me to stop dropping my ages and less people were indeed dropping their ages. But what was once linguistic heresy eventually turned into romance languages? These all have something to teach us about Latin. Wait, how can new languages be evidence for a dead one? We'll take Spanish or Italian a, it comes from Latin a but it also comes from short, eh, but not long.

Speaker 1:          04:53          He kind of like those inscriptions. It's even more evidence for short versus long. Also see, not know the letter c, the romance languages still love it, but before ease and eyes, it makes us soft sound except in Sardinian. So we'll good Italian. Say Vincenti in Sardinian conquering is bean cafe. No Romance Palatalization is another story, but historical linguistic says these languages are whispering at us and see, always sounded like Kay, but most of us changed their thumbs. Upping quintillion. So you see younger self, all of this is why when Romans talked about conquering, they said when Katee and why Caesar's phrase was Winnie weedy Wiki. Now before you go around in forcing reconstructed pronunciation on us, getting the pope to speak like a real Caesar. Think about Latins living history. This was, but one part of the story. Pretty amazing one though. Stick around and subscribe for language.
