Speaker 1:          00:11          Welcome back to my series, exploring the various ways that sounds change over time and languages. I'd like to wrap up these videos with the look at rules and laws. When someone identifies a regular sound change pattern in language or from parent to daughter languages across history, that pattern is traditionally called a sound. Long key. Laws are named after their discovers or popularizer like grims law laws may involved Llanishen dissimilation or any of the sound changed types mentioned in previous videos. So grims law defines a systematic sound change in [inaudible] manic, the parent of every Germanic language from Icelandic to German to Gothic to English. Part of grins law involves d voicing of voice stops. So the pro Indo European or root Gwyn turned into Quinn woman, the English cognitives Queen.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:07          we can write that particular rule. As waste stops become voiceless, stops grims law and other sound laws are built out of rules. These rules are the conventional way that historical linguists state how sounds change in the language. The basic formula is simple. Give the sounds that change the sounds that they change into and the environments where that change takes place. So in Portuguese, the letter s is pronounced between two valves, like in the word cosmos. Here's the rule notation that tells us interval Kalik s it's pronounced zoo in that environment,

Speaker 1:          01:56          and here is the rule that voiced stops in pro Indo European turned into voiceless stops in dramatic regardless of environment, the order in relationship of rules is crucial for understanding their significance in the development of a language. For instance, you can use your understanding of rules to establish a relative chronology, meaning that you can determine which changes took place earlier than others in a languages history. Let's imagine a simple human language. We'll give it a cool name. Like x x underwent two minors, sound shifts in one shift and became em before a label consonant. This language has the labels, P and F in other words, and assimilates to a following Lavia in the second shift, a short unstressed, it was deleted, but only if it occurred between two consonants. In other words, unstressed, Eh, undergo syncopy. NowX has a word aim fee. Comparing data from closely related languages.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Just as we did in the introduction to historical linguistics, we've been able to reconstruct the pro form of that word as Unifi. Now that I've given you this info, tell me which sound change happened first, deleting or changing and to m to help you answer that question. Let's build rules for the two sound changes. First end becomes em before a consonant with the feature label. Second unstressed, it becomes nothing when it's between two consonants. If the Prodo word is yen, if she then applying rule one first leaves us with Oh fee since end doesn't assimilate to a following consonant, it comes before vow but then we'll to applies leaving us with yen fee. But language x has yin fee, not yen fee. So

Speaker 3:          04:05          Rach that try the reverse order rule two turns Unifi into yen fee and now rule one can apply. Leaving us with yen fee, which is exactly what we find. So it looks like rule to took place before rural one, which is our relative chronology. This fictitious but credible example from language x raises awareness about not only the timeline of rules but the order of those rules. When an earlier rule creates an environment in which a later rule can operate. The two rules are said to have a relationship described as a feeding order. There earlier rule feeds into the second one. So in language x rule number one which deleted it allowed rule number two which changed and to m to apply. That's an example of a feeding direction. When the rules are reversed, the earlier rule abandoned and environment which is filled by little later rule, the result is a counter feeding order. Let's imagine that early in its history, our language x had a rule that deleted em before a consonant, any consonant whatsoever. The parent language had a word lump fee, but this first rule and becomes nothing between a vowel and a consonant applied to that Prodo word giving the output left fee in language x a later rule. The one we're already familiar with changed end to em before a label consonant. So rule one deleted am's before consonant, but rural to put them right back in, not in the same words, but it recreated the environment.

Speaker 3:          05:51          When an earlier rule creates an environment in which a later rule cannot operate the two rules in a bleeding order. The outcome, the first rule applies, and the second one doesn't go back to language x, which has a rule that deletes m after a vowel, but before a constant. It was this rule that changed the Prodo word lump fee. Two left feet. Young speakers of x are applying a new rule these days. They Insert have pee in the consonant cluster, m f so instead of saying they say, but they fail to apply rule number two to laugh fee which lost its cluster MF thanks to rule number one, when the bleeding rules are reversed, the earlier rule operates, followed by the later role, which would have prevented the earlier rule from applying. The result is a counter bleeding order. The outcome here is different. Both rules apply returned to our rule in language x that deletes and unstressed, Eh, in the middle of a word. But here's a new rule that moves stress to the pen ultimate. The second to last syllable of a word.

Speaker 3:          07:06          That first role helped turn Jenny feet into Yemen fee, but it also caused the word off the SA to change, to offset this new accent shift moves the stress to the first syllable, resulting in the modern word off. So instead of off side had a Fisa change to our Fisa, it would have prevented the rule that deletes that unstressed, eh, but since it happens second, the two rules apply in a counter bleeding direction. This series has taken the time to share types of sound changes with you, as well as how to state those sound changes using phonological rules. I appreciate your interest and your attention throughout the series, and I thank you for taking the time to learn with me.
