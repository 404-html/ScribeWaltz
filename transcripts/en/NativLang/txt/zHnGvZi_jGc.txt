Speaker 1:          00:08          This is clearly a bus, right? No, no, not even close. This is obviously a Greek people carrier and if you want to get around recent one of these, better busts out your electronic calculator and look up the road knowledgey in a quest machine. But if that doesn't have your leg, what would stick around? And let's take a look at the weird, the crazy. And there's sometimes hilarious words that tongues have for talking about new tech knowledge

Speaker 1:          00:57          throughout India. It's incredibly common for technical terms to come from Sanskrit, not English. In Sanskrit, you can learn all about the principles of things, the principles of chemistry, the principles of prosperity, even the principals of pleasure. Uh, hello. Where was that one in my university's course catalog. Never one to give into the barbarians. China has crafted some nifty tech terms. Take the two characters in mobile phone. They stand for hand machine. Clever enough. But check out this word. Sure. It's sounds like hacker, but it cleverly slides past copyright infringement. Hey, we didn't steal it. That's just our word for dark visitor. If you come down with a fever while speaking Swahili in Kenya, you'll be a person sick when you visit the doctor, but let's hope you don't get diagnosed with problem of kidney because then they're probably going to have to shred or

Speaker 2:          01:56          Blake, you

Speaker 1:          01:59          GE has made an art of ditching foreign words and creating new Turkish ones since the end of the Ottoman days. Before you get too cozy. Here we're talking about the heyday of this kind of Ottoman, not this kind of Ottoman. For anyone out there who's to life goals happen to be getting into space and competing in the Turkish language Olympiad. Yes, that's a thing. Here's one stone for you to birds practice Turkish in a space vehicle. Totally makes sense, right? You'll then join the elite group of spacemen era, but you can't be totally averse to sharing the experience with other languages because you're going to need things like rockets and computer algorithms to get the, speaking of computers in France and Spain, it's an ordinator or is that or did nay

Speaker 3:          02:43          total or

Speaker 1:          02:46          I bet you wish your comp had a name that powerful nearby Italy. On the other hand has no problem just using a computer, but to be honest, not everyone in Italy is so happy to take on new words. The Vatican has good terms for everything from audio, visual fables to nocturnal taverns to my personal favorite, super spacious airships boom. There it is. A Latin jumbo jet, you know, I bet some Roman emperor has really wish they had one of those collegial out. We're looking at you. She's just what history meet it, right? Or Romans Soul plane. If Latin jumbo jets can't convince you that dead languages don't stay dead, then check out Icelandic. We're old resurrected words. Dig themselves right out of their Zombie Viking graves.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Yeah, it's cool that the old word for line came in handy again, but nothing beats booting up your Icelandic number, prophetess weighted go Iceland. You're such a make believe land as if we didn't already have proof of that in the form of Bjork and Sigur Ros cross the pond in the ink and Andy's, you can take a class on the world order in the native tongue. In fact since patch already means time or space, why not dig into the relations of world things? Sorry you and this guy probably know that better. It's the theory of relativity. Got Your fill of physics. Don't leave the new world just yet. First drive north in your black foot starts to run without a parent. Cause if that's not fast enough, the Koyukon of Alaska might suggest and it rises of its own accord to get you there a little faster.

Speaker 1:          04:26          If you don't have a term for it, just make the word look. Native Hawaii has this down Pat Hawaii dicing words and phrases like I know Kia gives a Halloween imports and authentic look and feel and that gets us a come at pula, assuming you don't want to go full on native and call it in the electronic brain. That is so cool. Getting terms to sound and look more native, even if they're totally not is everyday business in Japanese with the locals can box in for an examples by writing them in a totally different script. So hairdryers are hairdryers and roller coasters are roller coasters in Japan. Even if they don't look like it at first. Yeah. So see that and that and that and that and that. Yeah, they're all from English. Oh, yeah. Hey, there's one more piece of technology I wanted to share with you guys. It's called the subscribe button, and if you just, you and I can stick around for more technology awesomeness in the future. I promise not to do the robot ever again. Just click it. Go ahead.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Yeah.
