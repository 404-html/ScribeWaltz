Speaker 1:          00:44          This series now contains over a dozen videos presenting the basic grammatical features of Volcker Latin and the romance languages. Each video contained many examples pronounced out loud, but none of them address the topic of pronunciation directly. This video finally offers a rough sketch of the pronunciation of vulgar Latin and early romance with some notes on how that pronunciation developed and splintered as Proto Romance divided into the modern romance languages. Classical Latin valves had two values, short and lung. The name refers to how long the val is held short versus bond. Ah, you can hear that long vowels are held out longer in time in vulgar Latin. The quality of a vowel became a major difference between short and long vowels. Some vowels sounded different even if they weren't held longer, shorter, long and short, but short a long, a short or long, Ooh, short, long. Ooh. For example, Benny has a short a well Belterra has a lung. Hey, notice how crucial the differences in some prodo romance words. The all in song is short, but the o in Solo is long. You can see that long mark Macron above the long vowel. Sometimes the short mark is used above short valves, but usually the valves aren't written unmarked outside of educational materials.

Speaker 1:          02:33          The length of a is trivial. The modern languages, most of the have a, whether the val was a longer short I in Latin, but the historical length of other vowels matters more often. Sometimes what were once just long and short versions of the same vowel or spelled quite differently in the modern romance languages. For example, the verb bolted he can with a short all comes out as Spanish way. The French old Italian Walter classical Latin used develop vowel combinations I n hour, which tended to but didn't always merge with devours a and o. Here's the word. Oh, cool. And some of it's modern cognates, and this is the word Christ Yona, which was regularly pronounced you on it in early romance. Diphthongs also occur for short a and short. Oh damnit. Spanish DNA. Italian DNA. French. Yeah, or both the Spanish way, the French Romanian Wata. Most consonants are pronounced very much as they are in English, but pay attention to these ones. The stops written. P T and c are an aspirated, so they're pronounced without that puff of air in or h sound that often accompanies them in English. So this word is pronounced battery, not pottery. This is to not to, and this one is Gallo rather than Kelo considered this an important note for English speakers.

Speaker 2:          04:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:43          The you in Wa and doesn't fall silent and vulgar Latin. So lingual and linguists where aqua and aqua

Speaker 3:          04:56          or

Speaker 1:          04:56          Quando instead of French and Romanian gunned late Latin speakers drop their H's. So earlier Latin Hora became vulgar. Latin aura. The letter r was trilled like aroma or threes. V was pronounced, not wa like it wasn't classical. Latin Vino v later merges with B and a few languages including Spanish, which has been no

Speaker 1:          05:30          double consonants were pronounced long, just as they still are. An Italian flammer Ila, the letters c and g represented stops. Casa Kelo both with a cuff sound, Gusto and gained both with a Gus sound eventually see was soft and before Eni originally palatalize to something like Chia and eventually so sure. Or some cello, Spanish Filo, Romanian change. The same thing happens to GE or GM before he and I, which comes to sound like Joe or Joe and later in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Jen Bay, Spanish Kane. Uniquely Sardinian doesn't do this. So g and c stay close to their original and Gus sounds before he and I in Sardinian cello, French CN, Sicilian shell, but Sardinian, Caillou, Kya and gear. Our examples of palatalization vulgar Latin consonance turn Palatal by pronouncing a short, yeah, after the consonant and before another val. This why sound is written with an I or sometimes the j, so and or no is palatalized in the word bowel.

Speaker 1:          07:02          New l gets palatalized in Maryetta, t is palatalized in Gracia. This little y sound has a lasting impact on later romance words. For example, that palatalized t in Grotzia doesn't stay a t thanks to palatalization that Tiaa eventually becomes a sung in French glass, sir, in Italian Grotzia and in Spanish. Yeah. Palatal consonants don't always get treated the same. Either take the Prodo romance word venue, which has the Palatal [inaudible] sound in Portuguese and Galician. This comes out as venue and Benu, but Italian and Spanish have vengo and Bingo, which no longer have palatal sounds, romance, consonance, where sometimes soften between valves and this was routinely the case in western romance languages like French, Spanish, Katelyn, oxygen and Portuguese. This process called [inaudible] explains why the final t in Tato becomes voiced. D and Portuguese [inaudible] a the sound in Spanish gone tallow and disappears entirely and Caribbean Spanish going to allow. This is also how he's single. S comes to sound like zoom between two vowels in many romance languages aside from Spanish and Romanian, Casa, Italian, Gaza, Portuguese causa, but Romanian Casa, vulgar, Latin and early romance syllables often contain a vowel or a consonant plus avowal better equaled a single consonant may close the syllable factor.

Speaker 3:          08:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:57          consonant clusters were also found like plug in [inaudible] or the script in script. Most words had a prominent louder syllable and this stressed syllable was typically the second to last one, like in [inaudible] or Casa. Sometimes it was the third to last syllable, like in Pearl spittle or Betty, the other syllables where unstressed, unstressed syllables where sometimes cut out. This happened at the end of words, particularly in Romanian, French, Occitan, Katelyn and Romance Burrow Sparrow becomes French post spare, which lost its final syllable and solid becomes Spanish son. Without that final e, sometimes the middle syllable was cut out better equal. Lou was shortened to Betty clue and later Spanish belly grow. This has been but a rough sketch of vulgar Latin ed romance pronunciation. It's meant to help you understand the pronunciation of words throughout the rest of this grammar of romance, but it's also a springboard for learning more about the pronunciation of Latin, of individual romance languages, and of the historical sound changes that took place between them.
