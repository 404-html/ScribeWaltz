Speaker 1:          00:08          The last lesson introduced the concept of arguments. This time around we're going to distinguish now noun roles from down cases. If you're not clear on down cases, take a look at the lesson on nouns in the introduction to the grammar of words. Let's go back to the example I gave it to him from the last lesson. The verb give takes a giver. A given that is something that is given and to give [inaudible] someone who's the recipient of what is given. We end up with three roles, almost like performances that those nouns play more specifically, they're themed or thematic roles. Those thematic roles are giver, given and Givi. Those three roles become available because we opted to use the verb give, so the verb give dictates three roles. Other verbs have roles to see, has a seer and a scene and make has a maker and a maid.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Now let's extend this paradigm further. There's a similarity between the giver of give and the seer of c and the maker of make. Those subjects are all agents. They're all doing something, so we call that the agent role. There's a more passive role. That's being played by the thing, given the person scene and the thing made. Those passive roles are the thematic role of patient compare intransitive verbs like ice sleep, you walk, she ran or you fell. There's another similarity, but conventionally we think of those roles as distinct from the agent of Mader gave. These people are experiencing a state, we'll call this role the experiencer. We might ask what's the point of all these roles? Why not stick with Noun cases after all? It seems like we could explain the grammar of I slept by saying that sleep has one subject in the nominative case, so I say I slept and not me slept.

Speaker 1:          02:07          The subject of see looks like it's in the same case while the object is in the accusative case, so can't we stick with our concept of nominative case nouns versus accusative case nouns as we'll see in the next lesson on alignment, that distinction isn't quite so clear, nor is it universal among languages. We can use this concept of roles to figure out how verbs work with their arguments. For now, let's set cases side by saying that case nouns are qualified to fill thematic roles. For example, English nouns that filled the role of patient are in the accusative or object case, but not every noun that's in the accusative fills the role of patient grammatically. They're two different things that will suffice for preliminary distinction between cases enrolls. Join me next time to build on these two as we turn to the topic of alignment.
