Speaker 1:          00:00          China has a lung linguistic tradition. Did you know Chinese scholars? We're digging into old pronunciations centuries before Europeans were reconstructing prodo languages. This is the tale of how they uncovered their ancient imperial language.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22          I struggle with Chinese pronunciation. I have ever since the dictionary and cassettes, my granddad once gave me for my birthday, but lately I've been burying myself in hundreds of pages of Chinese linguistic history, and you know what? I'm in good company, Chinese pronunciation puzzled experts in China for a long, long time. Like this fellow, a scholar reconstructing a language in the 1840s you know this story by now, I've told it before. Compare a group of related languages. Classify them into a family tree, then reconstruct their common ancestor. Oh, but that's not the story this time. This scholar is Chumley. He's confronting a centuries old problem. How do you recover? This sounds immortalized in classical texts. How do you make the old poems, Ryan? Again, here's the catch. You have no recordings, no phonetic transcriptions, not even an alphabet. You're working with characters. The Han characters we've talked about here before.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Each one's standing for a one syllable word or word peace. He scrutinizes the book in front of him. It looks old, stodgy even, but it has quite a backstory. 1,261 years earlier, uh, Mister Lou invited eight friends over for a slumber party. They started their evening with wine and conversation, but late in the night, the friendly chitchat turned into a heated debate over the exact pronunciation of old texts. The way people recite them in the north is wrong. No, they're wrong. In the south enough talk, Mr Lou inked his brush and outlined what would become the t a. N. He eventually filled five scrolls with over 11,000 characters divided among the four Chinese tones and subdivided into rhyming groups. Then he broke down the sound of each character. How with two more characters and upper character to match the initial consonant and it'll lower character to rhyme with the final sounds including the tone.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Take the character here, meaning east. It had the initial of duck and the final of UHMM. So using the reconstructed pronunciation, we'll talk about it at the end. It's done with this method called funds. Yeah, you can capture the sound of a syllable, simple and clever, but it stopped short of giving an overview of Chinese phonology for that Reimers needed to take step. Organize this info into tables. The 12th century Rhyme Mirror is full of rhyme tables. Here's one of them. The very first table in the book, the starting label gives the table number, number one, and the kind of rhyme. These syllables have a sort of uhm, along the top row are six articulation categories for consonants and down the side, the four tones, the four rows per tone give more info about the syllable, but their interpretation is debated. So try this, find me a tongue sound.

Speaker 1:          03:36          A lingual that's clear, meaning voiceless and has the first tone. So for this syllable type, we've pieced together something like doom. And then there's a partly clear one, meaning aspirated. So kind of a tone. And this one is dirty or muddy, which means a voiced sound. So maybe don't, okay. What about all these circles though? What do they mean syllable not found? So when you look for a lip sound that's clear for the first tone in this chart, you find nothing like boom recorded here, but there is a boom mug wards just like that. You're excavating old pronunciations, Chinese rhyme style and so confidence scholars spent centuries sounding out ancient Chinese syllables and teaching. The Chinese had exactly 36 initial consonants, but Chung Lee's not convinced. He's combing through old fund ca meticulously chaining together initials of initials and finals of finals is linked sets revealed flaws.

Speaker 1:          04:51          There weren't 36 initials, there were 41 five of them needed to be split in two, but there's more. The sounds in the rhyme tables are not the sounds in the tin. These are two different stages. Later research, we'll go on to show that even the earlier stage itself is complicated. It's a compromise between ancient literary dialects. Thinking back to those late night debates over the north versus the south, that sounds about right, but all this hard work merely left us with categories, boxes, boxes for four tones, boxes for initials, boxes for finals. The enough with the guesswork. What are the precise sounds that really fit into these boxes. In the early 19 hundreds of Swede traveled to China and dug into the old rhymes and tables, but then added an important piece, the many living varieties of Chinese call green was fascinated. He created surveys and set out to document them and he used his results to fill out the rhyme categories with real sounds.

Speaker 1:          06:03          How well take that fourth tone also called the checked tone along the southern coast. He's checked tones, syllables have a final stop sound. So this old character meaning country is or in Mandarin, but in Cantonese it's who's older? Well, look at the last three languages in Kellgren's list of dialects, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese. They use Sino, Zenith pronunciations, meaning China, foreign. Basically the way the characters sounded to them when they were imported, their words also have that k it points back to an ancient pronunciation for that character that ended in a consonant like linguists went on to refine these reconstructions and to paint acoustic portraits of ancient Chinese that put sound downright foreign in Mandarin. Today. They even revealed small but important distinctions. Calgrin missed like these pairs of Tromeo and they taught me one last thing while I was over here struggling to understand Chinese pronunciation. It's not a single language called ancient Chinese. No, it's a period in linguistic history, cold, middle, Chinese middle, because there's an even older language to uncover. A thousand years older still. Maybe one day we'll rhyme our way into old Chinese until then. Stick around and subscribe for language.
