Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh wilfy civilization once spread across Italy, founded ancient cities and may have left us with words like person and Rome and even the alphabet. The Romans. No, no, not them. I mean an earlier people whose language was almost lost to us almost, but not quite. Let me take you back to Egypt. In the mid 18 hundreds a European traveler has been touring the local sites and now he's shopping for a souvenir, wandering the streets. He chances upon the perfect bargain, a sarcophagus with the mummies still wrapped up inside. He hauls it back to Vienna and sets it up as a creepy showpiece in his home. After his death, it's donated to a museum where something odd is found. The mummies, bandages are filled with letters and not a few letters, either. A whole book, a puzzling book. It wasn't Egyptian at all. The ink red, like inscriptions from Italy made by an ancient civilization.

Speaker 1:          01:09          The Romans called it through ski or to Ski. Today we still call their homeland Tuscany and now here was this mummy wrapped in the longest to trust. Can text ever seen? It was precious, but this linen book had a problem, a problem. It's shared with thousands of other interest in inscriptions. The language looked nothing like any other mysterious but not on deciphered. These letters go from right to left, but flip them and you'll see that they are basically our letters. See the popular story goes that the ABC spread from the finishings to Greece to Italy where Rome inherited them. We're missing a piece though. It was the trust skins who spread the alphabet in Italy and it seems the Greek alphabet they inherited had to Lenny sounds for them it trust skins were fine with voiceless patrol car, but they didn't need the voiced but go in an inscription.

Speaker 1:          02:10          They even wrote the word for Greek as Craig Gay. This is why the Romans, when they borrowed the alphabet, originally pronounced, see as both coc and [inaudible] looking at the Greek alphabet. It should have only made the sound gum and in my video on Latin, let her modding. This is why we met a vexed Roman who added a tail to that seed. Create our letter g, but a trust skin did make use of sounds that might be harder for you to distinguish. Get your ears ready. Buh Buh [inaudible] versus aspirated par tar car. Like pursue mask, a word that lives on right in the heart of our English vocabulary. Ancient reports tell us that they were also missing the vowel ow or linguistically we'd say that they didn't distinguish. Oh from Ou. If we the claim that Rome took its very name from a trusting one. Interesting example is the word Houma.

Speaker 1:          03:05          So this book was missing letters but it also added letters like this curious eight looking symbol earlier written plus the Romans cut out the h and left us with f. So this is a f it trusts gins also had many letters for s sounds, but only use two of them at a time. A hint that they distinguished from. But what do these letters mean? The answers lie in an ancient dictionary written by the last known speaker, emperor Claudius who work was lost. No dictionaries, no grammars. And find after find after. Find frustratingly never uncovered in a trust skin. Rosetta stone. The experts turned to guests. Ology pull words out of the text and guests. Is this by chance? Indo European? No, clearly Semitic. Wait, it's like bask. No, no. Hungarian fed up with this circular approach. He trusts ecologists took a new path. Don't pull words out of artifacts, leave them in then like a code without a key.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Try out combinations. Look at each inscription in its context, combined different meanings in different contexts until you find meanings that unlock every text. It was brute force, but slowly this at Tory technique yielded results. We caught glimpses of a real language with real grammar. It had singular and plural nouns. Clen, [inaudible] ice. I said there were case endings like nominative a on kraken pronouns like me, meaning and verb tenses tool had a past tense two two care when covered a language with dynamic and changing sounds. Vowels. We're trending simpler. Over time the hero Ajax was once Ivus but later became ava us or gave us the word for the gods. The highest a trust can concern was ice it. And later a said they used nucleic consonants where we might expect vowels, loathing or maybe faint. Val's like utter lumper. These smashed a trust can word suggest the language under wit, a big shift.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Centuries into its written history, inscription start to drop [inaudible] after the first syllable via trust. Skin name for themselves was once [inaudible] but became rustler. And in one inscription, a Latin word gets chopped down to pressure. It's a major clue that it trusts can words started with a heavy accent on their first syllable, not cross center, but Ross and comparing translations and glosses yielded even more results. Take quasi bilinguals. These inscribed to trust can artifacts with the Latin or Greek doppelganger. My favorite are talking objects, aristocratic gifts that speak for themselves, meaning Moolow, Veronica, Lottie, svelte corners. It's very quirky, but it's plausible when we find out that objects also talk like this in Latin and Greek and phonetic, we were even finding hints of a context for the language itself, a language. So unlike its neighbors, uh, fascinating stone from the Greek island of Lemnos features a soldier surrounded by letters and words that really resemble a trust skin.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Is this a lost sister language dialect, perhaps a trust in wasn't so alone? Did it belong to a larger family of two rhenium languages? The language of that linen book is still mysterious. We don't know how this text got to Egypt, but thanks to all this work, we can tell it's a kind of ritual calendar. It's sometimes we can follow whole threads of text. Kaylee who through Mish [inaudible] Tate streak. It's almost like if you close your eyes, I could take you right back to the days of fluent to trust skin. But ask how to say a simple yes or no, and we're lost. Again, stick around at subscribing for language.
