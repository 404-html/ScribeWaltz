Speaker 1:          00:10          This video is part of a series that expands on the basics of historical linguistics by exploring various types of regular sound changes. Today's sound changes assimilation. Two sounds are involved here and one of them becomes more like the other. The assimilating phoneme picks up one or more of the features of another nearby phoning the Latin root. Sim is the key here. The two sounds become more similar. You've learned about phonemes and their features in my series, the IPA for language of learning, the place of articulation and manner of articulation of consonants will come in especially handy for the basics of assimilation. Let's take an example. The Latin phoneme. Doug has the features dental plosive and voiced the phoneme s has the features, Alveolar fricative, the Latin word, odd prefixed to the word Simi. [inaudible] results in the pronunciation as see me Latier. In other words, d comes to share all the features of the nearby s and is completely assimilated to s

Speaker 2:          01:25          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Speakers of languages the world over use a simulation to make words easier to pronounce for ease of articulation. There are different types of assimilation. Does d assimilating sound take on every feature of the phoneme that triggered assimilation? If so, the assimilation is complete. If it only takes on some of, or even just one of the features, that's only a partial assimilation. The assimilation in the Latin, uh, see me laugh too. Above is complete, but when I pronounce and as em before p and input, that's a partial assimilation.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:03          The two sounds are both by label, but one's a nasal and the other's a plosive.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Are the two sounds side by side, we'll call that contiguous assimilation. Are they more distant from each other? Not adjacent. That's non-contiguous. The two examples of assimilation I have given you both involved contiguous phonemes. If my tongue gets twisted and I accidentally say a Russian shoved marine for Russian submarine, the assimilation is non-contiguous. Does the change sound come after the sound it's assimilating to that's a regressive assimilation or is it heard before the sound it's assimilating to that would be a progressive assimilation. My embarrassing mispronunciation in Russian submarine is an instance of a regressive assimilation, but the assimilation of n two and input is a fine example of a progressive assimilation. We can also label assimilations by the features that are changed in the process. If the assimilating phoneme is originally voiceless, does it pick up the feature of voice from the other sound? This sound changes called voicing. Nearly all vowels in human language are voiced. Consonants often become voiced between valves.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Some Italian speakers pronounced the phonemes or as between two vowels asZ , like in Lamea causa my house. The change from s two Z is an instance of interval Kalik voicing. If the assimilated phoneme is voiced, does it pick up the feature voiceless from the other sound or from being at the end of a word? That's the opposite phenomenon called d voicing, so the word have ends in the voiced phoneme vote. The word too begins with the voiceless t. Some speakers, Dee voice, the two foot when they pronounce the expression, have to as Hafta does the assimilating sound move its place of articulation closer to the palate. This happens when the sound it's assimilating to already has a palatal or near palatable place of articulation. This is called palatalization and it's significant triggers include the consonant. Yeah, and the vowel e. For instance, some English speakers pronounced the word student as student in rapid speech.

Speaker 1:          04:36          The alveolar to assimilate to the palatal. Yeah, and becomes palatable. Vilar Chuck student does the assimilating sound change its manner of articulation so that the airflow is closer to a fricative. This is fricking to visitation and less restricted sounds triggered. This kind of change including fricatives and valves stops often undergo this assimilation. I've both heard and said the mispronunciation up through four up through that pronunciation. Fricker devices, the plosive puck as it is simulates to the fricative for of course, the phoneme can assimilate to any place or manner of articulation. I won't list all of them here. Further examples of assimilation to specific places of articulation include Labor utilization. When the assimilating sound becomes more lady and valorization. When the assimilating sound becomes more Vilar when it comes to matters of articulation, the assimilating sound can become a plosive and African and so on. There's an opposing change known as this simulation.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Two sounds are involved here too, but one becomes less like the other. The disseminating phoneme loses one or more of the features that shares with another nearby phoning the two phonemes more dissimilar. As a result, the English phoneme is a voiceless by Labor stop. If you say Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers as fast as you can, chances are you dissimilate one or more piece by pronouncing them as an f. Here becomes less like the surrounding piece by turning from a stop and do a fricative, but there are more serious examples in language history. The Latin root pedagogian getting comes into English as pilgrim rather than peer grim. The first are dissimilar rates to an l. The simulation has the same characteristics found in assimilation. They can be progressive or regressive contiguous or non-contiguous involve voicing or d voicing and et cetera. The one consistent difference is that this process involves two sounds becoming less alike. That's all for assimilation and dissimilation watch again next time when I'll go over the kinds of sound changes that involve adding and getting rid of south.
