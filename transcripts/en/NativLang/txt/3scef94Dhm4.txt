Speaker 1:          00:00          Etymology, semantics and meaning change. So far. We followed the trail of various forms of a word as it changed over time, but just stating that for example, Quain became queen ignores one crucial aspect and aspect that initially attracts most amateur enthusiasts of etymology. Semantics. When it comes to Etymology, semantics deals with the meaning of words and parts of words. Now, semantics tends to be fuzzy in two ways. First, the relationship between the meaning of a word and its form is generally opaque. Second, the semantic relationship between word forms given that they're meaning is known and even between word roots and words derived from those same routes through word formation is approximate and variable. Uh, consider the relationship between the meaning of house and the meaning of home or the etymological re in remain versus in reappear, we cannot simply set semantic relatedness to true or false.

Speaker 1:          01:00          We have to be aware of and capture the gradations of meaning. Like sound informed, meaning changes over time. We can classify meaning changes into types abstract too, or from concrete, general two or from specific temporal two or from Lockette IV. We can also consider the origin of a meaning change or the influence of languages. For example, calcs, calcs form. When speakers borrow patterns found in another language to express a meaning rather than bar. The Latin expressed the expression, we are locked here for our galaxy English speakers CALC. We are lack there as a new native term Milky Way. Other times, semantic loans occur when a language uses preexist preexisting word or phrase to cover a borrowed meaning. We can also talk about meeting and use words in use. Maybe this be described as literary poetic, archaic, obsolete, obsolescent jargon, colloquial, slang, preferred and so on. But however we classify it, semantic changes not as systematic as sound change under the real regularity hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          02:10          We expect that it, for example, if the African became the in a language words that once began with that, we'll now start with Z. Don't expect the same from say an abstract to concrete semantic change. Not all abstract meanings will become concrete in a language. A last note about meaning change. Uh, the basic core vocabulary of a language contains words that tend not to be replaced and whose meanings do not shift as much as the name implies. These words include basic terms like family members, terms for for earth, Sun and other words learned early and often. Um, let's go back and look at our etymology of Queen. You saw that the word came from old English Quinn. Let's add our semantics in old English. That word meant woman. What's more the Proto Germanic word, Quinn is and most cognates and other Indo European languages like Greek Kunae mean woman or wife. It's safe to say that the pro Indo European root Gwane also meant woman. This is an example of meaning change. The meaning shifts from general woman to a more specific female monarch.

Speaker 1:          03:22          As you read etymologies or build an etymology, there are some conventions worth noting. The source language, word and meaning are indicated for earlier attested forms. Parts of speech are sometimes given, such as now an adjective or verb language. Names are abbreviated and dates and sources support more thorough etymologies. The complex relationships between cognates and dialects are board boiled down to clear examples with relevant semantic information given. For each example, either by choosing the most representative attested word or by citing a reconstructed ancestral form. Comparative examples are also cited. Again, reconstructions are marked with an asterisk and um, words of trace back as far as possible. Sometimes in etymology becomes unclear contested, in which case the uncertainty is mentioned and the multiple possible origins are cited. For instance, there a double etymologies and cases of influence. Um, the English. Now fuse comes from Italian Fuso, but it's a dermatology was influenced by the French word fuzzy.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Let's conclude this discussion of Etymology by considering the context in which we may stumble upon etymologies, you'll often find it, I'm ologies and major dictionaries following definitions of many words. You can also get your hands on dictionaries of Prodo language, root words. If you're interested in doing etymology and reverse determining the words that have descended from some root word in a specific reconstructed language like Prodo, Indo European or Prodo, Mayan. A common source of etymologies is folk etymology, the popular telling and retelling of the stories behind the word folk. Etymologies often focus on names and popular phrases like mind your p's and q's. Of course, full get them ologies that are not always factually correct, but more importantly, they're never accurate enough to count as thorough linguistic etymologies. Folk etymologists are interested in storytelling, entertainment, and credibility, not precision and evidential support. Speaking of names, uh, on a mastic studies, the etymology of proper names, automatics is different because the meaning of words that turn into names, uh, 10 to become vestigial.

Speaker 1:          05:39          The name proper comes to refer to the identity of a person or place, but the etymology still interests even non specialists. What's more words derived from the same source can change in different ways when they're used as a proper noun. Names may be more conservative over time or capture the history of and interactions with surrounding languages. For example, the French name Jack preserves an old nominative singular case ending s which common nouns lost in French. The Spanish name [inaudible] contains a visit gothic route with a patronymics suffix. That's all for this introduction to etymology. I hope it's helped you understand it. Analogy. From a linguistic perspective, you can see that, well, an etymology won't tell you what the word actually means. That's determined by how speakers of a language use that word. It does tell the sometimes fascinating and unexpected history of the development of words in a language. The next time you hear look up an entomology, you'll be able to take a more critical and rigorous look at the origin of a word.
