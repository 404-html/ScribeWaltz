Speaker 1:          00:01          Etymology and homology explores the history and development of individual words, the origins of a languages, lexical items. It asks a question you're likely familiar with that question is where did this word come from? You've probably encountered etymologies when someone explained the meaning of a word or when you sought out the origin of a word for yourself as a linguistic study. This question is approached methodically, so it requires that we understand the methods that we'll use to discover word origins specifically at homology requires an understanding of the parts of words, their pronunciation and grammar components. So you'll need some understanding of phonology and morphology. Etymology is also a diachronic process. What this means is that etymology is a function of a language is change over time. So etymology will make more sense if you, if you're already versed in the fundamentals of historical linguistics, if you're aware of key concepts like cognates and borrowings, reconstruction of Poteau languages and discussions about what is a language and what is a dialect, we can start to build etymologies, uh, for the etymology of a particular word.

Speaker 1:          01:14          We'll need to know about language change over time in general and the history of change in a particular language that we're analyzing. We'll also need to know the history of borrowing a bard words are called lone words or loans, uh, borrowing into that particular language. And in turn the historical changes that those source languages that were the source of the borrowings underwent. Notice that words are often borrowed or inherited from non standard forms of a language. And that adds to the complexity. Take for instance, a medieval Norman French borrowings into middle English, like the word chief, which is not the same as the modern French word chef or the interesting case of dialect mixing, which accounts for the word pair, shirt and skirt in modern English. So with those complexities in mind, let's discuss how we trace the path of a word as it sounded in its form.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Change as much as is possible, we rely on historical attestation here. We expect our etymology to account for the evidence that is the word that we're tracing as it was actually used throughout its history. For example, the modern English word queen goes back to an earlier Cwayna in middle English. This word is a tested in Chaucer Quain. I in turn, derives from old English Quain attested in Beowulf. Here we can say that the Edelman or source word of queen is the old English Kwame, but we aren't restricted by the attested evidence. There are two ways to trace a more distant origin. First, we might discover that a word was influenced by or borrowed from another dialect or another language like English were chief, which was borrowed from French. In this case, our etymology can continue in that source language. Second, we can increase our time by comparing related languages and engaging in the process of historical reconstructions.

Speaker 1:          03:04          A clever intellectual development I introduced in the lesson on historical linguistics. Therefore, as much as possible, our etymology we'll take into account the history of borrowing it influence and will terminate at the earliest reconstructible form of a word, not the earliest attested form. For example, the old English word Quain can be compared to other early dramatic words like the Gothic quaint's or the old Norse fen allowing us to reconstruct a produce dramatic ancestral form as Quen is when we compare the pro dramatic word to cognates in other nondramatic Indo European languages like the ancient Greek word Janae and the Sanskrit [inaudible], we can begin to reconstruct a pro to Indo European root like goon or Gwen will then see that grims law applies to all Germanic languages, which changed. Voiceless stops to uh, fricatives and voice stops to voiceless stops giving us a route, Quinn, beginning with the voiceless sound k rather than the voice, GI or gut.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Know when I said that grims law applies to all dramatic languages, that doesn't mean that it still impacts modern languages, but like all sound laws, it effected words at one point in history. In this case in pro dramatic. So let's review what we've done here. We found the earliest attested form of queen and English compared to two words in related Germanic languages. To trace the word to a reconstructed proto dramatic word and compared produ dramatic to relate it into European languages. To trace the word even further back to a reconstructed prodo Indo European root word. Along the way, we paid attention to sound changes. Notice that you'll find an asterisk next to reconstruct it forms and also notice how the derivational path is represented visually. Uh, Gwen is becomes queen, which becomes Cwayna or [inaudible] comes from Queen, which comes from Quinn is it's also crucial to understand morphology, to know what kind of word you're dealing with.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Especially key here is word formation. The way affixes are added to routes to form new words, which is derivation or how words are compounded to form new words, which is compounding. Inflectional morphemes are certainly considered, but they're really part of the grammar or structure of a language. While etymology often focuses on content, words or content morphemes. Um, an example of why morphology matters when doing etymology, when we traced the history of Queen, we arrived at a pro dramatic word. Quen is, which has an inflectional suffix is attached to the root. Now in a separate instance, you might be doing the etymology of say the word illogical, that re that word has a root Logue and three derivational affixes, a suffix, a suffix. Oh, and a prefix in which assimilated too ill to do justice to the etymology of these words. You'll need to understand and know the derivation of these morphemes. In the next video, I'll talk about the role of semantics, particularly meaning change in etymology. And I'll also touch on basic conventions followed when presenting an etymology. Hope this has been helpful and see them.
