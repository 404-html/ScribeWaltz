Speaker 1:          00:00          This isn't even a full word, but can you guess which language in says? Chances are you can thanks to that very Spanish letter and yet hold on there. Once upon a time. This end with the deal day wasn't so Spanish. Take it apart. You'll find the tail of an ordinary mark that evolved into an extraordinary letter. Spain has a national hero, a really old one, like almost a thousand years old. They call him and see, or if feed. Look, Spain is notorious for lifting its fees, but out here in the western hemisphere and even over there [inaudible] it's [inaudible] and sit at the stuff a good national heroes supposed to do. He wielded a legendary weapon. He fought cunningly for various factions, but always kept bigger goals in mind. He won the hearts of the peasants. Oh, and he loved about Viet Guy. His trusty steed one legend tells us how they met when he was young, super the Reno.

Speaker 1:          00:58          His Godfather took him out to pick his very own horse. He was treated to a parade of beautiful stallions. Go on, pick one, the Betty Best one. You see somehow and seed peered through all this splendid mains and cuts side of the most awkward horse in the bunch. This one, I want this one, God father couldn't believe it, but Viet Guff for, why'd you pick that one? Whoa buddy. At Guy. Yes. I think his name shall be Bobby [inaudible]. He'd be a good horse. US mean you spent centuries weaving tails like this about your beloved said the most epic of these epic tales is a poem written in the 12th century. Gunther Daimyo seed. Some of my PsyD. Sure, there's this older Latin history written closer to the events, but the people, they liked the epic poem. That poem was preserved for us in one single rare manuscript and if you want to read this medieval manuscript, you need to know old Spanish, not just Spanish, no older Spanish, different words with different meanings, different spelling and pronunciation, different grammar, but before you can jump into any of that, you're blocked by this scribes handwriting.

Speaker 1:          02:07          The problem isn't really his handwriting. He was a fine scribe, neat and tidy. The problem is this script is not your script. Yes. It's the Latin Alphabet, but even once you adjust to the letters, there's something strange. Get your nose close enough to smell the paper. Actually, the big amino parchment, close enough to see the little squiggles. Interesting thing about parchment. Back in the day, scribes didn't go to the store and pick up packs for pennies. A page. This book making stuff was a very expensive endeavor, partly because of that ancient scribes. It started coming up with ways to save paper but keep their manuscripts. Pretty. One trick was to make words shorter. With hundreds of years of scrabbled practice behind the medieval scribes had amassed a treasure chest of symbols. They can get fancy, but here's a simple one you'll see all the time. The did DLoose what it for.

Speaker 1:          03:00          We'll look at the letters below it. Sometimes they're shorten words. Scribes were abbreviating everything from sacred names to run of the mill pronouns. When they did this though, they left a nifty over mark as a hint. It has a more specific use though. Look at the words Mundo commanded and also don't Lord and Donya lady from Latin dominus and Damina. The scribe could spell them out or he could remove one consonant and write this tittle loose on top of the letter before it. Notice which consonant got removed. The nasal n writing ends on top of previous letters instead of inline isn't something we can blame the seed for. It had been trending for centuries for both Latin nasals ends and ams. Good luck getting through too many medieval manuscripts without it ends above. Val's ends on top of consonants, ends everywhere, but these ends, we're still optional.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Take the word for year on those which had two end side by side. That word became Spanish on you as a scribe. You could take that second day in and write it as a [inaudible] loose above the first, but you could just as well take the first and have it hop on top of us or just leave them side by side. Over time though, the other marks fell away and [inaudible] the former double end was left all alone in Spain. Seemingly one of a kind. Why did only this one remnant stick around? Well, it was useful. The other nasal marks were interchangeable with a full on n but Latin double n evolve to have its own pronunciation in Spanish. Yeah. Ania this leftover did to loose isn't as lonely as it first seems though. Just next door, Portugal found this same mark, very useful for writing nasal valves in modern Portuguese.

Speaker 1:          04:42          They still use it not above end though, but to mark nasal. Ah, and Oh hmm. Hmm hmm. Oh, and here's a fact drop to impress your friends. The name for this mark did to loose became delay, which got borrowed into English as Tilda in Spanish. Though the day doesn't just mean this thing, it's the word for any special marker diacritic including the accents. But today's NBA isn't an end with a funny mark on it out in Spanish. One more change had to be made and image change that academia Hispaniola Royal Spanish Academy got together in the early 17 hundreds to organize and oversee Spanish vocabulary time to impose some order on this language. Their dictionary still the gold standard. But back in 1726 to group was barely taking a first stab at this dictionary business with their Dick soon audio authority. That is now you won't find any listed as a letter on the spines or title pages of any of its six volumes.

Speaker 1:          05:39          But entries that start with an ea are listed separately after n. It's a move the academy has since fully committed to today and it has its own seat at the Spanish alphabet table, middle keen say, and it's so quintessentially Spanish that it's become a symbol of Hispanic culture. Here I just localize my channel for Spain and Latin America. You laugh, but that is how some companies do it. So what? We're in his seat, stay ordinary marks on parchment. Found a way to outlast the rest of them and become a full fledged Spanish letter. A letter that only catches the occasional reflection of its younger days in scattered relatives from not to distant lands. Stick around for more linguistic stories and subscribe for language.
