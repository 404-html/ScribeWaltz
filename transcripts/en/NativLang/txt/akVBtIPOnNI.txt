Speaker 1:          00:01          Languages change over time, but how fast, let's say you fall into a coma, hearing your language spoken all around you, you snap awake in the same place, but at a different time. There's still speaking your language, but you can't understand a word. How long were you out? How long can a language last before it becomes unrecognizable?

Speaker 1:          00:28          Last time we met in eccentric Australian tongue called Jubal, a language where nouns can be edible or harmful, where you have to talk completely differently around your inlaws and we're speaking vaguely is considered a serious flaw and they don't even have a word for language. At least it used to be that way because when linguists came back to visit the jitter ball non decades later, they're language had changed. Then we heard from Swatis who argued that actually no, all languages change at the same pace. Replacing core vocabulary to constant rate keeping over 80% of their most basic words. After a thousand years swat ish then used his vocabulary lists and calculations to draw a line marking how long we'd expect to wait before dialects of a single language evolve into separate tongues. A line in the sand, the elusive moment of change itself, spot any problems with this idea these researchers shore did.

Speaker 1:          01:25          They grabbed their Swatis lists and pointed them at two sibling languages, Norwegian and Icelandic. The basic question they wanted Swatis to answer was this, how many years had passed between old Norse and Norwegian and how many between old Norse and I [inaudible] looking at wordless for replacement, plugging that stable rate assumption, it looks like Norwegian diverged a thousand years ago. Not a bad estimate actually. Well, modern Icelandic is 200 something years old. In other words, no one should be speaking Icelandic right now. Call Up Iceland. Your language is a mistake. The numbers don't lie today thinks to debunkings like this and the fact that Icelandic exists historical linguists except that the rate of language change varies and for various reasons. According to this paper, one factor could be population size. In a computer simulation, smaller populations borrowed and replaced words faster than bigger communities. The author of that Dribble Grammar Dixon himself proposed another factor.

Speaker 1:          02:31          He called swatting as idea that Kimra of glottal chronology and argued instead that languages have long, stable periods but then change in punctuated bursts during moments of social upheaval. So is that why Gerbil changed so much? So fast, a small population and a quick punctuation? Well, a careful look at the switch from traditional durable too young, durable suggests another variable. The biggest reason why the language changed much in just decades. Language death. A few decades before Dixon's grammar, about 30 [inaudible] still lived around the upper Tully river hanging onto the old ways. But these days it seems like nobody is learning durable, threatening, even young dribble with extinction. It's not just assimilating to Australian English or turning into a bare bones pidgin or creel. This researcher tells us it's not that simple. Behind the steep change from traditional journal too young, durable was this smooth, oldest to youngest. Dropoff durable has been dying its own death and language.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Death is its own variable with all these complexities. How long do we have to be out before we wake up to a brand new language? It depends. Some tongue seem to keep their shape over a thousand years. Others do indeed changed quickly within centuries, but take another look at that question we started with how long can a language last before it becomes unrecognizable, not unintelligible to earlier speakers, utterly unrecognizable. See, even if a time traveling Jubal speaker couldn't understand the language, they might still be able to pick out familiar words. How do we know this will happen? Because it has happened. This isn't the first time [inaudible] has evolved. We got a glimpse of its past changes in part one when we met a relative of Juba where the word for dog, his dog, that word took linguistic know how to prove it was actually related to durable, not English, but other patterns among Australia's languages are easier to recognize.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Whatever you think about Swatis lists, here's a fun use for them. Compare basic vocabulary from a bunch of Australian languages and look for cognates. Comparing cognates and sound changes in grammar. Linguists focusing on Australia's languages looked far back beyond dribble to recover its entire family, the Pama Newman languages. There is dissent. Dixon in particular came to reject this grouping, but the consensus is that Paul Newman constitutes the largest family on the continent by far using various lines of evidence. Pama Newman is held to be around 4,000 to 5,000 years old, which is intriguing because look what happens when we estimate the ages of other language families. We get similar time depths. The one aberration here seems to be Prodo Aphrodisiac of story for another time. Some historical linguists worn that. They don't do dates, but some that do see a limit here. Comparing languages can only take us several thousand years into the past. Of course, in my tower of Babel first language video, we did meet some mavericks who dare to go even further, so how long should we keep that hypothetical linguistics patient under to make sure they wake up to a change to language? Well, within hundreds of years we could expect degraded with hand waving on dates and exactly how understandable it will be, but within many thousands of years, even distant traces of the language may have dissolved. They'll keep your apologies handy in case this answers too vague. For the general bond stick around at subscribed for language.
