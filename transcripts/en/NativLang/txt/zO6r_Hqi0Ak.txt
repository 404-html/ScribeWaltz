Speaker 1:          00:00          When the alphabet first popped up in the Mediterranean. It was a single scratchy list of letters, but no European alphabets have not one but two symbols for each letter. One big upper case and one little lower case. So I hear you ask why the extra complications. How did this resizing happen? Gaze now with these sternly romantic, Latin and Greek inscriptions with their textured words that sink shallowly into they're crumbling slabs. They look like epitaphs for an ancient civilization, but narrow your aesthetic focus and look only at the letters. What do you notice? Capital Letters. It's all capital letters, big imposing monumental capital letters. Even when they took up softer media writing on puff virus and parchment, the Greeks and Romans pen their words with these big letters, this magic school script that's right century's worth of all caps rage. But the rise and reign of Christendom brought with it the ascent of the book and booksmith scribes with ink flowing from their pens.

Speaker 1:          01:02          The large sharp angles of older scripts gave way to smaller rounder fluid forms. In the late seven hundreds Charlemagne invited the scholar Alquan of York to his court. And this man shaped up the king's scribes developing and teaching what we know is Carolingian minuscule, the most celebrated early Latin, minuscule or lowercase script. Around the same time, Greek writers came up with our own running cursive. Handful of smaller miniscule letters to Byzantine Greek had a particularly strong minuscule tradition, which dominated it's manuscripts. For a thousand years, Latin and Greek weren't traveling alone here, Greek brothers Cyril and Methodius tweaked their alphabet to make it suitable for old Bulgarian in the eight hundreds and so they gave birth to the cyrillic alphabet. Now, cyrillic never developed the kind of very distinct lowercase forums found in Latin and Greek manuscripts, but eventually it did distinguish smaller and larger letter types. Now at this point in our story, notice that uppercase scripts and lowercase scripts are different scripts.

Speaker 1:          02:04          We're not really mixing magic skills with Munis skills here. When did the modern mixing start by cameral scripts, ones that treat uppercase and lowercase as variants of the same letter. We're still on the horizon. You can get hints of the system and old writings like those larger capital decorated initials that adorned medieval manuscripts, but by cameral, uppercase plus lowercase became the standard when language is written with alphabet, settled on employing minuscule for most texts, but using the magic skill letters to signal important information. A big letter at the beginning of a sentence, a big letter at the beginning of a proper name. We're even at the start of every single. Now these have all been standards in the history of English and the last one still is for German, but not all by cameral siblings. Agree. Should you capitalize the name of a foreign language or not?

Speaker 1:          02:56          Ken capital's fall in the middle of words. Should you even capitalize the first letter of every sentence? Should you write some things entirely in caps by cameral scripts don't have a monopoly on different forms for a single letter. Maybe we'll save the details for another day because I always like doing these comparative of sides, but think about Syriac and later, but very similar to Syriac Arabic. These cursive scripts don't have capital letters, but each of their letters have up to four distinct shapes. Initial in the letter connects to the start of other letters medial when it connects between two letters final, when the letters connected to the end of of their letters in isolated, when it's all alone, there's even a cool acronym for these. They're in fees, scripts, and well, sometimes the difference between IMF I forms is pretty small in scripts that are as maniacally cursive is Syriac in Arabic, it's very important.

Speaker 1:          03:48          So maybe by cameral in empty scripts are both part of a broader phenomenon. How a single letter can have multiple standard variants within a script, but still be the same letter in the same script. It's interesting to think about. It's a good question. Thanks for asking it. But now that we've tackled the uppercase and lowercase letter variants, and now that the word by camera rolls off your tongue and makes you sound even smarter than you already were, I want to move on to another story of Latin letter variants. It's a tale of ancient and medieval letter modding. Modders.
