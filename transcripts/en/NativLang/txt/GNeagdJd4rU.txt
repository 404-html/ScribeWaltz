Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17          When you're arguing a point using logic, you establish the premise seeds to support a conclusion, but many times your conclusion doesn't actually follow from your line of reasoning. No matter how much you or your opponent are convinced by your argument. In that case, you may be relying on a fallacy to persuade yourself and your opponent. This word fallacy sounds charged and can certainly get tossed from side to side, decided heated debates, but in logic of fallacy is merely a descriptive term. It says nothing about how dumb you are nor about whether or not there exists some real way to support the same conclusion. Let me show you how it works. I made an argument in the previous video demonstrating that coffee isn't to beverage but a food. In this argument, I relied on two distinct meanings of the word coffee and two different meanings of the word beans in my premises.

Speaker 2:          01:03          I was intentionally vague and used compact language to hide these choices. The simple language makes the argument much more convincing than if I disclosed the intended meaning of these words. The result, the conclusion looks like it follows from the premises, but it's really not supported by them. The conclusion may or may not be true, but it's uncalled for here. This reliance on the psychological persuasiveness of a statement is a hallmark feature of informal fallacies, which are informal because the truthfulness of the conclusions content can't be derived from the truthfulness of the content of the premises. Still the arguments for may be perfectly valid. Like my food is coffee syllogism. Here's some examples of informal fallacies.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Okay. Hm Hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm.

Speaker 2:          02:30          The list goes on it all cases, informal fallacies, rely of content that does something other than support the conclusion in order to get you to accept the conclusion, you can get a feel for how the logic of the supporting line of reasoning actually runs. If you just remove the fallacious statement like this, not so reasonable. Now is it recall that arguments don't just have content. They also have form. We called an argument with well structured premises into conclusion. So it may not surprise you to hear of a formal fallacies which arise when we shape the argument in a way that the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises. But people can still be persuaded by the conclusion because it seems to follow. Let's play around with a few arguments to see if you can spot weaknesses in their form in their structure. First, a refresher, a basic syllogism.

Speaker 2:          03:21          A is B, B is c, so a is c. Fill it in as you like. We've seen that this form works. Next, a second point of reference and an even simpler argument if p then Q, p, therefor Q. This is a basic reasoning strategy and it works. What about this one? A is not B. B is not c. Therefore a is. See, think about it for a moment and check against other examples if you need to. The first premise only supports that a is not B. So anything we say about being the second premise can't apply to a positively or negatively. The conclusion doesn't follow. This. Next one runs aground on the same issue as the last. A is not B. So no matter what we say about B, it doesn't apply to a

Speaker 2:          04:15          what's wrong here. I've negated P in this conditional statement, then assumed that Q must also be negated, but perhaps Q is conditioned on something else. Spot the problem here yet. No, look closer. Keep looking because you won't find it. This one's good and I leave it to you and your clever ways to figure out why. One more for you. Can I argue that what follows from a conditional implies what proceeds consider this form carefully. A implies B only states that if a holds B also holds, it does not mean that. Be always follows from a come on. You remember your logical by conditionals, right?

Speaker 3:          05:01          That's all for fallacies. Well, for this introduction to fallacies, I'm sure you will encounter plenty more. These last two topics introduced arguments and fallacies and I'll add them to my playlist for the intro to logic.
