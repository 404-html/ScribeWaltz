Speaker 1:          00:03          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03          Last time on comp top cold war computers were showing real promise at translating Russian into English Georgetown University stage to successful tech demo and the press was impressed. Times were good for machine translation. Aye. Aye. Aye. Okay. Now that we're back, the money starts rolling in because if the public support something politicians can't lose by throwing money at it, but people started taking sides round one fight. In this corner you had your linguistically minded perfectionist. They wanted to feed computers, all the detailed grammatical rules about every language. And in this corner there where your brute force crowd brute force or is, we're all about the evidence. You set computers loose on real sentences and they should be able to find the patterns on their own. Unfortunately, progress from both sides just wasn't living up to the bold claims made after Georgetown and the public. They started to notice in 1962 hypers ran an article titled the trouble with translation and with a title like that, you know, it was going to be fair and objective.

Speaker 2:          01:06          The, uh, author. Recall the demonstration of machine translation where the computer was given the scriptural nugget. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. The output we are told is laughable. The liquor is holding out all right, but the meat has spoiled. I just want to pause for a moment. The dymo reported there didn't happen, but this story and Harper is really illustrates how far machine translation had fallen a few years earlier. Those exact same reporters were just heaping praise on it and now it was the butt of their magazine jokes. The scientist's stepped in for some damage control. Do you remember Bar Hillel? Our first full time machine translation man, he argued that our expectations were just unreasonable. Natural language could be ambiguous and computers can not handle ambiguity. We shouldn't expect them to translate languages for us. We should just get them to help us translate for ourselves.

Speaker 2:          02:00          Translating languages was way more complex than even the experts could have guessed. It was a literally turning out to be harder than rocket science. Now in the face of souring public opinion, the u s government, because again, they only like throwing money at popular things. They commissioned the Alpac Josh, is that a Lama? Wait, no, sorry. It's not a Llama. It's actually an elite group of seven experts tasked with deciding the usefulness or uselessness of machine translation and computational linguistics as a whole. That's quite a task. Their verdict. Oh, we'll, we'll get into that. But first there's something you need to understand. Throughout the history of artificial intelligence, people get sold on promises far beyond their wildest dreams and it happens so often that there's a term for it, the Ai hype cycle, and when things go wrong, the chill sets in a chill with lasting effects.

Speaker 2:          02:55          It's called an AI winter, and no amount of jackets protect you from that chill. So the verdict, the 1966 ALPAC report concluded that we do not have useful machine translation and there is no immediate or predictable prospect of useful machine translation. Ouch. Computer as it turned out, were twice as expensive as human translators and they were doing way, way worse. The officials were convinced and machine translation was defunded. The first AI winter set in computers and language obviously had a rough start, but I promise it gets better. Eventually subscribe, go eat your Borscht and uh, write some code chunk.
