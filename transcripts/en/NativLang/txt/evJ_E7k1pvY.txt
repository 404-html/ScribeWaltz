Speaker 1:          00:01          Languages change over time, but to some evolve faster than others. Let's say you fall into a coma, hearing your language spoken all around you, you snap awake in the same place, but at a different time. They're still speaking your language, but you can't understand a word. How long were you out? We'll try to answer that question in the next two videos. Starting this time with the speed of language change.

Speaker 1:          00:31          [inaudible] ha ha. No. [inaudible] the name of a language in Queensland, Australia, a very quirky language. First brought to our attention at the turn of the 19 hundreds and full of so many unexpected features that the grammar written about it or in the status of a linguistic epic. Thanks to this book. Even from my first linguistics class, I heard fantastic tales of dribbles, fascinating features, features like it has four genders, human males and animals, human females and fire and water and harmful things, edible things and other or inanimate objects. It has incredibly free word order to the uninitiated. Dribble sentences might seem about as organized as word soup. The people than jitterbug them have a no vagueness policy. They couldn't save vaguely. She made me laugh. They'd have to be more specific. She told a joke and I laughed. She tripped and I laughed. She tickled me and I laughed and in this language, there's not even a general word for language.

Speaker 1:          01:34          If that's not enough to tickle you consider my favorite of durables. Eccentricities. A woman had to speak very differently in earshot of her father in law and a man around his mother-in-law. They called this jungly. It had the same grammar as normal speech, Google, but the content words were switched out to avoid offense Joe when we came in handy and other complex social situations, but it always involved speaking with completely different vocabulary. It sounds extreme, but it happened. Jibo was so peculiar and so influential that linguists have even gone as far as to say that without Dixon's grammar, our understanding of the world's language diversity would be much poorer. Something odd happened when linguists returned to study the language just decades later. Traditional Jubal was mostly a memory. A new durable young, durable had taken over. The class system had been reworked. Word order was no fixed with basic subject verb object sentences, just like English.

Speaker 1:          02:34          The mother-in-law language had been appended some everyday words were being used in new ways and others were being forgotten for good. Where we watching durable dismantle itself in front of us. Can the core features of a language really evolve this fast? What is the speed of language change and how could we even measure it? Well, ask Morris Swatis. He's the first person I know of who laid out a method for calculating the rate of language change. He developed a one size fits all solution he swore would work for every language around the world, from Norway all the way to the northern rain forest of Australia. Take a list of words, basic words that kids learn at an early age, the kind that ideally don't get replaced very much from generation to generation. Compare it to the same list of words and a descendant language. What you should find is that some words that had been replaced, but many are still essentially the same word.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Sure. Some sounds will get tweaked and it may take an expert's eye to recognize their sameness. So Dixon tells us that the jury will word for dog is good, but when he documented a neighboring language and Bob them, they told him their word for dog, his dog. Seriously, nothing to do with English though. It's a coincidence. It turns out that this word is cognitive with Gouda for Swat Ish. That counts as a retention. On the other hand, water is [inaudible] in all dribble dialects except one where it's gone. This counts as a change once you know the proportion of retained words. Next comes the fun part. Gelatto chronology, timing. Tongues. Swatis thought that basic vocabulary works like radioactive decay, meaning that all languages replace words at a constant rate over long periods, and he felt vindicated when he checked his assumption against history. Say the time it actually took from Latin to turn into the romance languages.

Speaker 1:          04:29          The method look solid. After a thousand years, a language keeps 86% of the 100 words on Swat issues list. It's an amazing thought. Just looking at a list of words in a language he could calculate how old it is and how far it is from its relatives. He could even construct a lexical chronometer. That's the nerdiest thing I've said all day, but it predicts how long it takes to hit major vocabulary milestones and end up with a brand new language. Remember our hypothetical coma patient you have, there'll be waiting a long time before Jubril changes into a new language, another 900 years. Because languages change at a constant rate, except they don't come back next time to see why not and learn a bit more about Australia's languages as we ask. How long can a language last before it becomes unrecognizable? That's right. A two parter because this is too interesting and because my drawing hand needs a rest, so stick around and subscribe for language.
