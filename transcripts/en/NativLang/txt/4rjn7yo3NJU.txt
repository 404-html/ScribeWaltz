Speaker 1:          00:02          Hello. I recently finished my biggest project yet all animated tour of the history of writing, but before we move on, I wanted to take some time to cover two things. One, what we missed and to what we got wrong, but I think there's someone better for this job. The narrator herself.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Hi, I'm Jessica. Uh, hopefully you already know me as the voice of thoughts pill. If you haven't had a chance to catch that yet, I highly recommend it and there's a lot of great stuff in there. I'm also the girl who was about to start showing you how your life is made of code over at comp comp, but a thoughts pill. Yeah, this was really a labor of love and as it stands now, we put about 10 to 15 minutes into this film for every single person that's watched it so far. So that's a very personal connection for us. 99% of that as Josh. Ah, he did all of the art, the animation, the music, the scripts for the animated history of writing, even recorded himself, narrating the whole thing over and over and over again. But he ended up liking my version better. And so, yeah, I'm the narrator.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Um, one thing that that meant was that, uh, there were a lot of parts where you actually hear the like languages that we're talking about and I don't actually speak those languages. So we ended up cutting that. Um, but let's talk about what else we didn't get to. So, uh, in the beginning we had pre history and the cave rushes over so much of history and speculation about proto writing and we kind of used it as a metaphor just as much as an actual historical place. And when you leave the ancestral cave and inter the civilized world, we need Loga graphs. The original plans had us pan from the dark cave up to the wellness world above once we were up in those cities, we profile a handful of them. Some of them like the Minoans and creek just barely get a mention later on in the series.

Speaker 2:          01:52          And if you start digging, it's not hard to find other early scripts that we skipped all together like LMI or Cypriot or is that the tech and the questionable unsolved mysteries of prehistoric writing like Vincia symbols and into scripts and whatnot, integrating those really started to sidetrack the story. So after going down the birth of writing hitlist, we ran into that early tension between meaning and sounds. Well, we originally had a second tension for these cradles of civilization. What is writing for these symbols helps civilizations expand. CARF propaganda, track their goods, time after time. These old loba graphs are about kind of boring, mundane things like counting goats and barley or that king so and so ruled for such and such a long time and smoked all of his enemies throughout his many, many days of being awesome. But, uh, fortunately for the romantic and all of us, some writers were capable of turning even these early symbols into verbal art.

Speaker 2:          02:51          The most famous early example is Gilgamesh. A story that top the cuneiform bestseller list for over a thousand years, which is really, uh, we ended up folding the idea behind this tension into the flexibility and creativity versus consistency. Tension that shows up when we talk about the manuscript. It was particularly sad for us to cut Gilgamesh. It's a story that reminds us that civilization and its innovations team, the savage human, but at a cost nature is wild and mortality as elusive, but civilized humans can live on through their physical achievements during their lifetimes. It was sort of an uncanny prism for thermoses warning. In the introduction. Oral ideas are embedded, but thoughts pill. The technology of writing DM beds you and offers some degree of immortality to your thoughts and actions. Okay. Onto rebus writing, we talked a lot about taking a character and using it for it sounded like value.

Speaker 2:          03:45          Of course, there's another option beyond using the same character for smaller or larger chunks, and this will apply to later. Innovations to the character can change. And the process. Anyone who's ever learned to read another writing system has the experience of painfully copying every little nook, cranny and Seidler of assemble before finding out which strokes are meaningful and which ones can be left out. Add service to an I and you're fine believe that.off the top and things kind of get weird unless it's in Turkish and then they're entirely different letters. Although it's a crucial step in learning to script like a native. The stroke game is something that's obvious from the inside, but can really perplex outsiders. I contrasted using characters for syllables and cuneiform versus continents in Egyptian. Hieroglyphs to technical details got cut out here first. The writing direction, we later mentioned when we get to China that were words go and where they stop matter in writing.

Speaker 2:          04:43          We were going to be a bit more specific for hieroglyphs showing you that when you're reading hieroglyphs you read into the bodies. Some materials will tell you into the faces, but even when there's no face around body parts still face against the direction you're reading unpacked. And for cuneiform we had a whole section on Josh's favorite cuneiform court. That's right. He's got a favorite, those Sumero grams and it came to grams. That evolved as the script was passed around the Fertile Crescent. It didn't really fit well into the script, but it became its own video and this clip from that video made its way into the documentary when we talked about how the early choice to use syllables shaped every later version of the script. So there was also an important question to ask here and when they hit through other close to home, is it surprising or novel that the leader scripts around the Mediterranean, you know the ones that lead to our alphabet end up using consonant segments like the Egyptians had already been doing in an ask it whatever onto determinative.

Speaker 2:          05:41          This revolved around Chinese and spills over into the part on Maya, but it's really worth taking some time to read up a bit on how this happens in other scripts and how they use determinitive. Egyptian and cuneiform actually use them too. It's one of the reasons each section in this story is structured a specific development in the history of writing. We're looking at these as common solutions to problems faced by multiple scripts, not just cultural teams. Uh, the other reason is we wanted to jump around to exotic locales because traveling is fun, even if it's just in a cartoon. Anyhow, a determinative, I lumped classifiers and determinative and radicals together. If you're interested in putting those concepts apart and digging deeper, I recommend starting with this paper on the use of complementation in the Maya script. Basically, it argues that we should use the term determinative for a meaning sign that helps us choose the spelling of a word and classifier for our meaning sign that tells us which category the word belongs to.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Another thing when it comes to China is stroke order. The way of writing the characters. Josh actually thinks this is so important. He, uh, wants to write a whole separate script and do a different video for it. I know he recorded a rant a really long one. Uh, I don't know if he's planning on animating it, but if you're interested, you might want to let them know. Oh yeah. Uh, both Chinese and Maya remind us that sound writing isn't the right way to write. Be Era of history doesn't inevitably point from meaning to sounds. Inventing phonetic characters does not mean that you abandoned your lower graphs. Innovations and traditions can hold hands and it mixed writing system like this. Uh, and a lot of you picked up on that but I wanted to make sure that we specifically put that out there. So from Central America we flew to Egypt, which reminds me we're going to stand by this title for now.

Speaker 2:          07:28          Provocative, yes, but not misleading. Uh Oh. I will say one other thing about Egypt by focusing on the trajectory to our alphabet. We totally missed out on another thread that was in the initial story plans from Sogdian to Mongolian. I don't know about you guys, but I personally would love to have seen what kind of fun, crazy characters Josh came up with for covering Mongolian. I'm getting Iskcon is one of my favorites. Gene just however you want to say his name, the same. Oh man came up later too when we didn't get to tell the stories about to carry on and Ethiopic Alpha Cilla Berries, although at least the Abita did squeeze in there for one quick little exercise at the end of India. Speaking of Alphabets, uh, I really liked the way Greece turned out. Josh wants you to know, he thinks it's a bit funny that the Greek is that the Greeks and thoughts pill, no etic stuff that wasn't common.

Speaker 2:          08:18          Iem acknowledged in ancient times. You're a new friend friend talks about Troy and the ancient Greek script that actually predates the alphabet, but he stopped short of calling it linear B. Truthfully, it's already an anachronism that he knows about this script in the first place and can mention how it works. Since early documents written in the Greek alphabet suggest that Greek civilization fell into complete illiteracy. Essentially they all forgot how to write and that brings us to an interesting idea that actually didn't make the cut. It's what I mentioned to Josh when he shared his outline the first time people losing writing. This animation looks at writing as a of inventions and improvements. But what about the steps backwards and sideways and even away from writing? What impact did those have on writing to get a grasp of the strangeness here? Think about the use of pictures and nonverbal layouts of information on websites.

Speaker 2:          09:10          And what other ways do we supplement or move away from the written word? Uh, speaking of Alphabets, we brought up the correspondence between symbols and sounds and then the birth of the Latin alphabet. We originally wanted to go down the road a bit and discuss historical spelling, English and French spelling, guarded tutorials for this. But over time, the alphabetic principle can get a little lax since a word might be spelled the way it was when this system started, even when its pronunciation is modernized and flagrant disregard for the ancient tongue. Uh, the example we plan to show for this was from Irish and it went like this, right? The word who are, yeah, that's right. Uh, oh. And yeah, we totally hear you. That we did not cover uppercase, lowercase. It's definitely a topic that we want to go into, but we didn't have time to fit it into thoughts, pill.

Speaker 2:          10:02          Um, it really is worth a video of its own. Okay. So on to ob dots that the pirates trader was a reminder that writing back in the day wasn't some guy grunting and making crude marks. There was already an entire industry behind each stroke of the pen or press of the stylists into clay. Think of all that it took to make an ancient Mediterranean text harvesting to book Paris, cutting the stocks open and cutting it into strips. Loing layers of those strips together crosswise to make a sheet using well developed trade networks to distribute that paper overseas. It goes on and on. The Phoenician merchant was a mental prick to help remind you of the obvious that writing leans on the development of civilizations, the materials, resources, trade routes. It was also a way of getting you to think of the economy of writing and extending that to get you to ask questions about how the economy shaped the look, the use, and eventually even the dispersal of writing, uh, writing on the horizontal Recto or front of the book pirates instead of the vertical verso of the proprietress or how ancient letter shapes changed from chiseled to inky.

Speaker 2:          11:08          On the Mediterranean map, we see some scripts pop up. One of them is in Iberia. Well, the rather unique Paleo Iberian scripts are semi Cilla. Barry's derived mainly from Phoenician with some possible Greek influence. Okay. Time is getting away from us here. I promise I'll just mention a few more goodies. In Phoenicia we tackled matrass and pointing and originally asked a bunch of questions for you to ponder what's better in a writing system. Optional extras like fouls added in only when you really need it. That set things straight or a system that demands clarity even when that clarity is a peripheral less. Um hmm. Let's skip ahead to king. Say Dawn, who's heard exotic tales of the west of India. This was a nod to the concept of India as the West in East Asia, the most well known example of this reference is in the Chinese novel journey to the West.

Speaker 2:          11:58          But if you start reading, you can dig up a whole history of relationships. Here's another hint. The Go Juwann of Japanese Kona have an order strikingly reminiscent to the layout of Devanagari used to write Sanskrit. Uh, yeah. Okay. So in Korea, uh, since feature alphabets get treated as a separate type of writing system, we thought it was worth including in our major moments. Some of you definitely disagreed. Korea is also the location of our technical error that just stands out like a sore thumb. Josh switched the name of two of his sheep keys. So these Korean characters got swapped out in the final cut. So after Korea we end with a look back. But our idea of a look ahead at the future of writing didn't make it. What about changes in how we communicate like pictograms or signs or relying more on videos and images to communicate?

Speaker 2:          12:49          What about emojis? Are we communicating better info faster now? So writing is just less necessary and it's not doing the same job at once. Debt West Cecil shared a similar thought in his talk about the future of language and it's been on our minds. Oh and a do different scripts do different things to our brains. How does growing up with a different writing system impact anything else? Like the way you think about language or ideas or even the way you store words? Uh, finally, and Josh has been trying to get me to stay quiet about this, but I want to tease and say that there were a decent number of Easter egg scattered around the world he built. I don't know if all of them showed up in the final camera angles and whatnot, but a lot of them do. MMM.

Speaker 2:          13:33          Okay. So that wraps this up. I just want to thank you guys so much for taking this journey with us. I'm really glad I got roped into this. I was very hesitant at first. I said they're not going to want to hear a different voice on the channel. Um, but you guys were so welcoming and your feedback in the community has just been fantastic. If you're interested in seeing more of me or learning how your everyday life is made up of code or hopefully both, uh, you can check out my new channel comp chomp, Josh is going to be over there animating, making stuff fly around the screen and coming up with a lot of the cool topics that we do on that channel as well. Uh, and if you have it already and you definitely should subscribe your native lane and encouraged Josh to keep doing videos about language. Otherwise I'm going to steal him and he's only going to be doing computer stuff. Now. I know he's really busy with classes and has some other projects, but um, your encouragement when it's genuine, it really matters. And, uh, even if you know, you just had him get some quicker sketchier art out there. The videos are fun. Anyway, subscribe for language and now subscribe for programming language. Fun to jump.
