Speaker 1:          00:00          Studying up on early modern English taught me how an old letter end up printing press made us start mispronouncing a Scottish name

Speaker 1:          00:13          in my search for the true sound of Shakespeare. Long hours at the library paid off with way too many amazing subplots to squeeze into one video before I tuck them into my notebook and turn out the lights. Let me share one story I really loved about a different kind of English. Thanks to a lung linguistic pass. There are more varieties of English and the British isles in in the rest of the English speaking world. At the extremes, these actually behave like different languages. We meet one of those extremes in the far north. Scott's not Gaelic, not standard English with a truly Scottish bear. Scots, it's the local lowlands way of saying Scottish, just as their word. Inglis evolved to ingles. Scotus shortened to Scott's. Consider your company carefully before you weigh in on calling it in lead or a dialect. It's a bit of a charged issue, but either way, sculpts has its own separate history.

Speaker 1:          01:15          The northern edges of Middle English gained a strong foothold in the lowlands pushing Scottish Gaelic to the highlands. The Scots lead emerged and evolved into its own sub branch of England, complete with Scott's dialects and even a literary form with quirks of its own quirks like Yo. This early English letter was a form of Ge used for a few sounds including the glide Yang Yi and the recipe sound at the end of its own name. Yo, this letter didn't last down. South Claxton's printing press would print g and you like this, but when Scotland got it's printing Press York was still alive and Yi you and in the name McKinney. Kenny. Hi. See, back then printing involved wouldn't sticks. Metal pieces forms to people to ink in press. It was a whole process. These weren't the days of holding down a key on your phone until you got a little pop up to choose.

Speaker 1:          02:12          The right special character type was literally metal pieces stored in a type case, so you'd print with the type you had on hand and you would keep around just enough to print. That's spelled the beginning of the end for y'all. The story goes that when the presses in Scotland didn't have the type, the middle piece for yoga and there wouldn't type cases, they just grabbed the letter zed instead close enough. Right? I've, especially since they're handwritten forms look so similar at the time. It's not that confusing either. After all, whether you called this letter zed or is it modern? Scott still doesn't use it much for the sound, but some words became so well known in print that eventually people base their pronunciation on that printed spelling, reading a XA sound back into a word that never had it in the first place. This shortcut didn't impact thing in or dramatic, nor the earlier spelling of the I yet, but it is how mckenny turned into Mackenzie. This cork is a great example of how language varieties can preserve a little bits of history, even events as specific as hauling a printing press into town and picking letters out of a box. All right, and I'll follow up. I'll get back to work on the next full tail. The one you patrons voted for. Consider becoming a patron yourself.
