Speaker 1:          00:11          This video continues my series about the various types of regular sound changes that happen over time in language. Last time we considered situations where existing sounds became more or less similar to one another. Assimilation and dissimilation. This time it's all about sounds that get added to or deleted from words. When a sound is added to a word that's called a parenthesis. The new phoneme is an empathetic sound. For instance, you may have heard some English speakers add an epithetic are to the word Sherbet pronouncing it Sherbert. Not all added sounds of the same is the additional sound of vowel. That's an up Texas Sardinian speakers changed Rosa to outer Rosa by adding an an up tick. Tick Val to the front of the word is the edit sound. That consonant if so, that's called excrescence. Ancient Greek speakers sometimes pronounced their word st as as team adding an excrescence consonant. Not all in parenthesis happens in the same place either if the phoneme is added to the beginning of a word, it's called pro thesis. The Sardinian example at Rosa adds a pathetic APP. If the phoneme is added to the end of a word, it's called paragogy.

Speaker 1:          01:38          The ancient Greek word esteem as a pair of [inaudible], n Elysian happens when a sound is removed from a word. The last phoneme is said to be elided or deleted. The final book sound has been alighted from the English word thumb. Compare the book and thimble.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Is the phoneme removed from the beginning of a word? That's a Ferris. For example, English speakers may shorten about time too. About time. Is this sound removed from the middle of award? This kind of allision is known as syncope. This we send you a word, meaning the bears is pronounced [inaudible] speakers. Cinco paid that middle. Who is the phoneme removed from the end of a word? That change gets called a pocket. So the word thumb, losing its final bow over time is an example of a pocket.

Speaker 3:          02:50          So this has been a quick ground level understanding of a pen stasis and allision. In the next video, I'll pick out a few types of sound changes we haven't seen so far.
