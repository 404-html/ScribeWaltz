Speaker 1:          00:00          How did Egyptian hieroglyphs give birth to the alphabet?

Speaker 1:          00:09          Even in these ancient times in monuments have been sitting and weathering for thousands of years on their great murals and pillars. You find rows of little pictures, sorry, not pictures, hieroglyphs sacred symbols, but despite appearances, this isn't some mysterious, very onic picture writing. It's confidence. One consonant signs, two consonant signs, three consonant signs. Oh, wall of consonants, plus a sprinkle of logo grass for determinative. It's not that Egyptian was a harsh bowel list and desert of a tongue. It's simply did not right at the bowels. Imagine if you wrote this way, would that work? And then imagine if you could add in logo graphs to make sure you really got your point across. Imagine you wrote like that and you're thinking with hieroglyphs too difficult, fine off to the caves with you where you toil away with ancient miners on the Sinai peninsula,

Speaker 1:          01:08          you and your fellow miners would find it handy to leave messages for one another, but there's no time for deep studies of rows of fancy hieroglyphs in here. You need to keep it simple. If you want another major moments. In the history of writing. Your characters look like scratchy, rushed version of those glamorous Egyptian symbols, but they're meeting doesn't matter anymore. Nothing but consonants and the same symbol for the same continent every time. Take this character in addiction. It means health. The Semitic miners are calling a house a bet [inaudible] or top sounds suggest that you can just take the first letter of a word like the Egyptians had already been doing with much of their continent writing. You end up with a letter for your sound. Buh. Do the same thing with water, which the Semitic speakers are calling mem and you now have an mm sound with a couple of dozen elegant simplifications.

Speaker 1:          02:03          You create a simple, reliable list of consonants, an alphabet, and you've given generations of future children the joys of reciting their abcs. Actually at this point in history there ab GDS sometimes called an object or ob God because who needs that wishy washy. See when you can just use an s or a k after a long hard day of mining an etching, you turn to find that someone's been watching you this whole time. She's a trader. A Phoenician merchant who knows a good thing when she sees it. She's already made major cash and the paper business where they turned tufty stocky, swampy Egyptian papyri this into flat ink couple sheets of paper. She rushes back home to Phoenicia and smirks.

Speaker 1:          02:58          Think of the, she has keeping track of whatever anyone else tells her just by remembering about as many characters as she has. Fingers and toes. All the kings can keep their up two's hieroglyphs and their stone monuments. The future of the Mediterranean will belong to alphabets and paper writing is going portable. She uses this new found alphabetic leverage to turn a huge profit across the entire eastern Mediterranean, leaving people inspired to adopt and adopt her alphabet wherever she goes. All this and she doesn't even write you a thank you card. How hard could it be? Writing is easier than ever. It feels universal like writings here to stay for everyone, but there is a peculiar quirk that's easier to spot. In hindsight, you and your mind crew, we're communicating in a Semitic language Phoenicians a Semitic language. All of these friendly shades of the Phoenician alphabet were being used for languages that sounded similar and worked much the same way. Even Egyptian though, no Semitic language itself is at least a distant relative of the Semitic languages with a similar personality. This continent, alphabet is being tested in easy waters, but history is shaking things up. Who are merchant friend comes back for your help. She needs you to deliver your alphabet to a very different people living along her trade route.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:19          What will happen when the alphabet gets leaked outside of the family?
