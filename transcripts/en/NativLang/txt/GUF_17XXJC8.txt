Speaker 1:          00:00          Pictures for things and even ideas gave us prodo riding, but we can do better. It's time to invent full fledged writing. You're ready to grab that Chisel and get your pictographic and idiographic carving on then someone inventive comes along. You system is artistic, but it's not practical enough for her. Gone are the days of Lascaux the world outside. This cave is changing. She says crops, cities, rulers, markets, and she needs a way to keep track of it all. She likes your icons. She can use them for goats and Potts fields and even long walks through the desert, but she has an incredible practical streak. She takes those goats in those pots and starts to tally the items. She's recording one goat. She says. Then two goats, three goats for goats. Notice what she's done. These aren't simple depictions anymore. They're not just ideas. She's reading one word for each symbol.

Speaker 1:          01:00          She's in coding language. Let's slow down here because it's hard to overstate the importance of this major moment in the history of writing these goat counts or words, symbols. Now, Loga graphs. Pictographs can be visualized. Idiot. Graphs can be imagined, but loga graphs can be directly and consistently red logo graphics systems emerge and flourish. And the early civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mexico, characters for people, animals, land crops, hundreds, even thousands of logo graphs for everything under the sun and moon, including the sun and the moon. Even after all these millennia, if you spent hard enough, you can still pick out the symbol, scratching to weathered artifacts, bearing the world's early scripts, a Chinese turtle and Egyptian house, a Sumerian head, a Sumerian had eating bread. Oh my. And Jaguar. And in each of these places, in all of these languages, these were red as words.

Speaker 1:          02:00          We know what these lower graphs mean and we can put that meaning into words. The world is now in a race to fill itself with logo graphs. But which humans started this craze? Well, the Mesoamericans started writing more than 2,900 years ago. Some Chinese characters, or at least 3,200 years old writing popped up in Crete 4,000 years ago. But the two clear contenders are Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian cuneiform. Both a whopping 5,000 years old minimum. It's common to say that the Egyptian stole the idea of writing from Mesopotamia and just came up with their own glyphs. Common but not demonstrated for a while. Mana genesis made sense. This is the idea that one civilization was king of all the writing. That writing started once in Mesopotamia, where people pressed a stylist in a wet clay to make these wedge. Cutaneous shapes, forms cuneiform, so the Mana Genesis story goes, everyone else steals cuneiform and re it to fit their own needs. It's not a popular story these days. Given what we know about Chinese and especially Mesoamerican writing along with some very early Egyptian fines, whoever's first in these early days of writing all the civilizations start manufacturing hordes of logo graphs. So many in fact, that they unwittingly unleash an epic memory burden on budding locog refers from would be ancient scribes to beginning students of Mandarin Chinese.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Do they really need this many characters to write? Surely there's an easier way.
