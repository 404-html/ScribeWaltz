Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's the tail of a language. They can build impressively long words and why it ended up alone in Europe, surrounded by languages that work so differently.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Central Europe, a patchwork of nations with Jagat borders. Let me switch to a language map though. What do you see and probably still patches, a patch of German, a romance language, some Slavic languages and this patch here, Hungarian. Now look again at this map of language families that Hungarian patch is a language island surrounded on all sides by Indo Europeans. After I learned about this isolation and then calculated out how long Hungarian words are, I just had to try out on my young yet the Hungarian language for myself. I am not Hungarian though. Practice along, and correct me, but this tail is too good not to share. Go back 1,122 years to a time when the Carpathian basin flat landlocked in surrounded by mountains was being squabbled over and who better to settle squabbles then tribes of nomadic horseman known to Europeans as angry but to themselves by the name of their foremost tribe.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Modular led by Arthropod, the modulars conquered the basin in the homeland, taking of eight 94, uh, homeful Galosh yes, lush s is shut and this is how you write an s but don't flip it or you get a judge on Darien for decades after these masters of the bow in the stirrup consolidated, their rule drove a wedge between South Slavic and the rest of Slavic and rattled nerves all the way to Italy, France and Spain. It said they even had westerners on their knees praying. They see these women got older, me better knows Domina arthropods descendants did manage to settle in warm up to the west, right at the turn of the Millennium, Stephen the first established a European kingdom, a surprising bastion of Christendom, but success left Hungarian isolated. And by the end of this tale, this language with it's oddly long words will reveal just how alone Hungarian is and is not.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Do you remember my longest word, adventure? Those languages stretched words by taking a base word and compounding it with another base. Like say you have two towns, Buda and pest, and you smash them together into one name. But that's not the reason Hungarian pops out. Long words left and right. It's base words at a bunch of grammatical slots, mostly at the end slots for everything. I swear the verb Yelland means notifier report. It's already itself built from smaller pieces, but whatever. Let's keep it simple. Put a bay in front and the action goes inwards or into Balent. Add the reflexive Kazic and your reporting yourself into logging in while you're at it. Chinks, this subject to be Olympic Isaac. Oh and don't forget slots for tenses and moods like the conditional Ne Wood in bail and cause nick nouns have hoards of forms. They put Latin to shame.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Take em, but say you wanted to give something to that human, you'll need the date of case embedded neck. If there are multiple humans, they're embedded. And if there's something for all of them embedded CONNEC. Wow, look at all those intimidating sounding cases down the list. These are just forms for say, up to being on top of going into, going out of and so on. Same for adjectives. Knowledge is great, but let's step this up a bit. Mazzetti great. Like means wonderful using the same endings. You can have plural, wonderful things and save them for a wonderful one. Note, city neck or for many wonderful ones, not city ethnic. Whoa, there's more. How about a slot for comparing wonderful things to find out which one's wonderful. Ular built city but and a superlative prefix slot for the most wonderful of all. Not City had. Wait before you take a breath, bringing her endings once more leg, not city beck, nick who now you see why Hungarian words get so tough?

Speaker 1:          04:14          These clumps of roots and affixes look glued together. So linguist named this kind of word, building a gluten nation with the Latin root glue. Some have grown skeptical of the concept, but it's been resilient. Part of the glue holding Hungarian together is it's val harmony. Did you happen to notice all the, as those as in the suffix are there to match the val in the base. So the plural of Embeda is embedded, but mouths are cyroc and medic cyroc autonomic. That's basic Hungarian grammar, but it's so foreign to all its neighbors. Why though? We know where it ended up, but where did it come from? The clue to its origins is right there and it's words. Historical linguists traced a trail of related words back to languages akin to Hungarian, nowhere near Hungary, way, way, way off in West Siberia. Together with Hungarian, these languages are part of a broader urologic family. Hungarians ancestors migrated from Siberia out to the southwest, bringing their long words to the doorstep of the Carpathian basin where our story started. See Hungarian in the end, you're not completely alone. You just have a long distance kind of linguistic relationship set at like the ticket ish. Him stick around and subscribe for language.
