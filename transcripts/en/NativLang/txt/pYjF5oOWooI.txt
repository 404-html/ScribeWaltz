Speaker 1:          00:10          Welcome to another video in my series on sound changes when I'm sharing the ways that sounds change over time in languages I've covered, sounds becoming more or less similar and sounds getting added or deleted. This time I'll highlight a few other sound change types starting with [inaudible], which means that a sound is weakened, it becomes more voiced or less restricted. This weakening often happens adjacent to other, less restricted sounds like vowels or fricatives. The ignition is potentially a multistep process of United sound. Might simply go from voiceless to voice or plosive to fricative will have fully lineated sound disappears all together.

Speaker 1:          00:55          The Spanish stop the is limited to a fricative the between valves, so this word is fun analogically Dow, those most speakers glide past this middle, the with even less restricted airflow. Davos some speakers take the [inaudible] step further by omitting the entirely douse. The path of this llanishen was voiced, stopped to voiced fricative to voiced approximate to nothing. There are two main paths alumni did sound may go down if the sound and question goes from a stop to a fricative to an approximate like the Spanish one did. This process of relaxing the airflow is called opening. For instance, Tuscan Italian speakers soften co two a fricative, so they'll scan gets pronounced Toscano if the sound goes from voiceless to voiced and then becomes progressively less restricted, it's called [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:02          We can see sooner realization if we extend the timeline for the Spanish word Davos I gave before. That word descends from a Latin word that toes, you can see a clear example of [inaudible] in this progression that those two dot dose to Davos to dominoes to Dallas. When sounds get weaker. Becoming more like voiced approximates, we call it [inaudible]. What about sounds? Getting stronger towards voiceless stops. That happens too and it's called [inaudible]. Strengthening turns a less restricted sound like an approximate or fricative into a more restricted one like an African or a stop. As a simple example that you sound in, you is fortified to an affricate Jay in the colloquial pronunciation did you? As [inaudible]. I'm going to move on to a handful of other sound change types. So start making a list. Don't fear though. I'll give simple explanations and examples of each one along the way.

Speaker 1:          03:14          If a consonant is deleted, but the vowel before it is length, and to make up for that loss, it's called compensatory lengthening. The protal Greek word, [inaudible] foot eventually lost. It's Duh, but ancient Greek speakers lengthen the vowel ow to compensate for that loss. So their word for foot was bowls, not just both. Speaking of the Greeks, if two or more sound swap places that has a fun Greek name metathesis in the nonstandard pronunciation of ask as acts, the two consonants and Sir get switched. Similarly, Sardinian speakers say four bolt instead of the expected Dato inherited from Latin towed, or if one or more vowels change to become like another valve within the same word, it's pleasantly called vowel harmony. Two examples here. First, the easier one. Turkish builds words by tacking on endings, but the vowels in those endings harmonize with the last val in the root word that they attached to.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So the Turkish, now ev means house. And the pluralist avalanche houses where the plural ending has the matching vowel, eh, but the plural of be not building is be not allowed. Within a second example, the vowel Ah, in the Proto Germanic word for people was raised and fronted to eh in men under the influence of the high front vowel in the next syllable, this change towards a high front vowel is called [inaudible]. In the history of the Germanic languages like English, I'll cover one more change here. We looked at stress and pitch acts and in the IPA for language learning, if the way a language accent syllables changes over time, the name for that is an accent shift. Early Indo European languages stress different syllables in different words, which shows up in the way Sanskrit and Greek accent, the last syllable in it does or [inaudible], but the first syllable in mythos or Mithid Germanic languages like English have fixed the stress accent to the first syllable. And this accent shift explains why the English equivalents of those words our father and mother both stressed on the initial syllable. In just a few short videos, you've been able to arm yourself with the range of sound change types, but instead of longwinded pros, can we capture the sound changes in concise formulas? The video, we'll tie up this series by showing you the most common and traditional way linguists visualize the sound changes that I've explored in this series.
