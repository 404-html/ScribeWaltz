Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, it looks at first glance like ancient art is actually a full blown Britain language, but what does this homegrown Mesoamerican script teach us about the history of writing?

Speaker 1:          00:16          I elaborate Rosa characters onto a stealer. A tall stone brought in from far away that's now standing straight up in the middle of the city. The characters he's carving. Look more like detailed pictures than writing, but don't let that fool you. Take a look at this block. It means mountain, but it's not. Although the graph standing for mountain, it's not a rebus symbol. Brewer, think of a word that rhymes with [inaudible] mountain. It's actually a block of two sound symbols that spell the word [inaudible]. The [inaudible] word for mountain. That's great for climbers, but chocolate lovers may instead prefer to sampled these three symbols that together though the word to cow cocoa, there's a nifty shortcut here. This bit doesn't even mean car. It's actually a syllable multiplier or iteration mark, if you want the fancy name.

Speaker 2:          01:06          Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:06          I think you're being watched over there in the jungle. Maybe not.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Major moments in the history of writing both of these Maya glyphs, combined syllable characters into blocks to write words. This is full fledged sound writing. These are Loga graphs that happened to be read as sounds. They are sounds, sounds capable of writing any syllable and the language in a full syllabary like the classical Maya script. There are separate characters for just about every possible syllable in the language. No longer must have been meant. New Word characters you can make do with a much smaller set of syllable characters. Nice, but syllable writing comes with its own set of problems. Here's a cliff that's quite useful around these parts. Jaguar, the word is actually belong, but have you noticed something about the Mayan syllabary consonant plus vowel, consonant plus bowel, more consonants plus more vowels. All of these syllables, Indian vowels. How in the world are you supposed to write the Lum in Balaam, shifty, scripty syllabi areas have grappled with this problem and settled on two solutions.

Speaker 1:          02:22          One, leave out the final letter. Just ignore it. The term for this is under spelling because you're not fully spelling the word and it's a good solution because you know ignoring your problems makes them go away. Option to spell the last letter with an extra syllable, but use a syllable that just repeats the last vowel so that we know we can just ignore the final vowel. This gets called the echo vowel. Mayan likes number two a lot. So the cow is Kako wa well, because times to Wa wheats, the mountain is actually we see. And your new pet Balaam is spelled Bala. Ma. Cross out the echo vowels and the words practically read themselves. Your new friend pulls you along to show you another project. He's working on an Amati Codex. That's a paper book. Yes, he has paper and yes books, but that's not what's got him excited.

Speaker 1:          03:21          He folds open the book he's working on maybe to share new ideas. No, to brag about how inventive and potentially efficient his writing system is. Know for his people. The invention of the new wasn't about ditching the old. He shows you how creative he's been with the characters you learned. He shows you a mountain and calls it weeds, and then a Jaguar and calls it Bilam low good graphs. Wait a second, you stop and ask him, which is the correct way to write belong. He writes Balama. You ask him to write it again, and he writes the logo graph, but with the syllable and again, but he writes the Loga graph plus two syllables. He smiles mischievously. They're all below them. This is what he's proud of. He can write the same word, even the same syllable in different ways and combinations without repeating himself creative, but his use of logo graphs plus syllables or calls.

Speaker 1:          04:20          The tension between sound writing, meaning writing meaningful, determinative, helped us choose the right pronunciation for our rebus character. And my end Luga graphs can still do that, but the helping hand goes both ways. The syllabary can also clarify the sounds you should make when you read a little graph. Here's the character Jaguar, but at a couple extra syllable hints and you make it clear that we're meant to read this cliff as Bala Ma minus the echo vowel. So Balaam. These are phonetic compliments, pronunciation, clis, sitting comfortably alongside logo graphs. If that's all too complex. Just remember that you can write everything in syllables, but before you have time to settle into this land of Balaam and Cacau to practice those syllables, a sandy wind starts blowing in from the east, uh, familiar reminder from a faraway land. We're even more dramatic. Changes are about to shape the future of writing.
