Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you swear like a sailor? Are you running low on bad words? Well, have I got a destination for your bucket list? An island where every word can be a curse word. It's vacation time this year. Forget old cathedrals or skyscraper city scapes. You want a real adventure. So you strapped together and outrigger meticulously following ancient oceanic craftsmanship and you set sail straight to the middle of who knows where in the South Pacific, the place you land might be. Who knows where to you? To the locals, it's my [inaudible], one of the Solomon Islands. You reach into your back pocket for that soggy South Seas. Phrasebook you hold along with you, but your sprinkles of French Tahitian, Tongan and Samoan earning you nothing but blank stares. But a clever people know exactly what to do when words fail. Point and grunt, nonverbal communication within a day. You've mastered basic words for delicacies like pig guts, mm.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And words for basic needs like shelter and sleep, your set, or are you the next day you get really hungry. You work up the stomach to order more of those tender pig guts. Your new found hosts with understanding clearly. If I could talk, these eyes would be saying, yes, come let us walk for miles through the hut. Jungled together and yours would answer back please. By all means. So they lead you to a new village guests. They were out of pig guts and had to talk to their suppliers. No problem. I mean, surely this face knows where you can find a belly full of scrumptious trails. Look, so friendly. Peer goes own gay bowl, my friend. What did you do? All right. Clearly you crossed the line. Fortunately you're subscribed to native laying. We're like insurance for your linguistic emergencies and double. Fortunately, you're not the first clue.

Speaker 1:          01:57          The Stranger to wash up on the shores. Back in the 1960s anthropologist Roger Kissing lived with the Cryo. Um, oh yeah, these are the choir fe high and they speak, uh, well. Quiet casing uncovered something strange about their language. See the choir really respect their ancestors. There's a whole respect system. You might call it pig slaughtering. They call it full stop offering. When important elders die, they have a chance to become a super ancestor and undone low, and that's amazing because then your adult grandchildren or great grandchildren have to raise full with the pigs to sacrifice in your name. Well, not exactly in your name. See, that's the thing. The root word in the envelopes name can become Umble taboo. If the under lose descendants decide to farm well enforced this taboo, it becomes offensive to utter that word in their presence. Dare you. If anyone ever wants to talk about you or you're a fourth a pig, they have to use your photo or name a secret nickname for the under law God.

Speaker 1:          03:01          It that's due simple and you're wishing quite oh, etiquette had like more nuanced, complicated layers than this. You win because those fault, the nicknames that people use to honor the dead without violating the taboo. Well sometimes those also become taboo and other pig needs a new nickname for the taboo nickname that it needed because the original nickname was taboo. The result is that the choir, you have some mad serious taboos going on, especially since most quiet, no names are made up of pretty useful basic words back in his day casing, notice that fight, fish and money were among the top five words used in both male and female names. And this one time on a walk over to a new village, his quite hosts nonchalantly warned him, oh, by the way, while we're there, don't ever say 40 a who he or la and la?

Speaker 1:          03:49          That's the word for fire. When you break a taboo and you're face to face with those grim looks from the village elders, there's only one thing to do. Set things straight. The ghost of quail pass demands a sacrificial pig for your insolence. But should you be short on pigs? A little cash could settle this just fine. Surely if they're living on an island but tattling words like fish, they still need some way to talk about the fish. So how do they replace taboo words? Well, sometimes they tweak the pronunciation until it just sounds different enough. Like changing the word for dry from Ongais to RK or they raid vocabulary from a nearby dialect. That's how fire La got replaced by doing the west. Why a word for fire there? Even hold descriptive runarounds like Uf, a wife becoming [inaudible], a woman of a man, but typically they switch it out for a word that means something similar, similar enough like pig guts going from own game, bull stomach of pig to Uli.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Embol insight of pig and we're back to where this journey started. The pig guts. Precisely the info you needed to avoid that cultural blender. You know the one where you demanded some food, walk to the next town over and started cussing at the locals, get a job. The choir's not alone here. It fits in with other oceanic languages. So I guess don't be surprised when you thumb through your psionic dictionary and see where it's crossed out. Like, yeah, I'm don't say this anymore. It's taboo. But then this brings up some linguistic questions. How does this taboo on naming the dead fit in with taboo terms? And curses and profanity and other languages is taboo. A wider, more general phenomenon. Also, if words are getting replaced so often in quiet, does it change how fast languages like choir, we evolve over time, so some advice if you're traveling to the depths of Oceania, bring it up to date dictionary. Of course, if you want to wing it, just carry around a lot of pigs or money. Thanks for learning with me. You're a real undiluted sticker out and subscribe for language.
