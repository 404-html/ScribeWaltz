Speaker 1:          00:00          Maybe you've heard that Hebrew and Arabic are written entirely in consonants wrong. Here's why you're back in old Phoenicia where it turns out the Greeks aren't the only ones looking to buy a vowel. Your contact in town is still your merchant frenemy. Who reminds you of how she traded your continent. Alphabet across the ancient world. That object spread to every language with even a passing resemblance to Phoenician. Every town from here to Carthage has some version of her object spot. The Egyptians, those stuck in their way. Traditionalist initially, these submitted speakers, loved it, they were proud of it, but the days are turning to years and that love grows cold. They grumble that they're stuck with these continents. Just consonants clamoring for vowels. They get desperate and grab a few characters to stand in for a long sound. Take a look. This symbol is originally the stop between uh, ah, ah, this one's a y.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Uh, yes sound and this is a Wa, but they're about to become not these things thanks to major moments in the history of writing. This moment hits you twice because it brings up both in innovation specific to submit scripts and a more general principle that kind of bins the rules of the alphabet game. First, it's worth reiterating that object writing systems are viable ways to write and read a language they work, but with one obvious shortcoming, those missing vowels can create ambiguous situations. But what if instead of writing every vowel, we just had a few helpful hinders that suggested the presence of certain kinds of vowels. Take this letter, what actually they called it? Wow. Wow. Now imagine that we keep using it in words that have the sound Wa, but we also extend its use, placing it between consonants for the similar enough foul sound.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Ooh, in the old op job, you'd have to write soon, and son with the same characters. S plus in everything else is vowels and we don't have those, but suddenly our extended work comes in handy. Son Doesn't have that ooo sound, so it's still s plus in, but soon does. So we add in the WWE do the same thing with Ja, which can double as a long I and this quirky catch in your throat. Pause between uh oh a left, which can double as a long awe and you end up with three handy val suggestors, the Matras Lectio, these helpful mothers of reading that show up in Aramaic, Hebrew, Arabic and Syriac that these mothers don't leave. They're consonant nus behind. They still double as consonants. The object traded the ambiguity of a vowel. This existence for new kinds of ambiguity depending on context. Each of these matrass may be a continent or it might be a vowel one character, multiple sounds.

Speaker 1:          02:46          This is a huge trend in alphabet. Why invent new characters when you can reuse an old one? Repurposing continents for vowels here and there won't satisfy everyone. These bickering scribes aren't content with mattress like the owners. They're not just trying to tell son apart from soon. The bickering scribes are bickering over how to read one of their most treasured sayings. One says that it's such a fine point. You wouldn't understand unless you were incredibly well versed in his language. But he makes an analogy for you. Write the word news and a continent only alphabet. It's in ws. Fine. Now imagine that someone comes along with their fancy consonant vowel hybrids and spells the word nous in w s hmm. Wait a second. He shows you a cheat sheet he's been keeping. It's so easy. He says, pointing out the little dots and dashes above and below letters to keep his vowel straight.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Put them here for an awe there for an a. You can even add them below one of the long vowel things. If you need to distinguish, say an eat, nobody's confused. That's it. He won't tolerate the vagueness any longer. Effective immediately in all important texts where clear reading matters. Everyone's to use this method. And so for generations, scribes would mark bell's above and below the consonants, writing bowels in what was once a consonant, only alphabet, but as much as the pious and students whereby they're Dadi vowels. Modern Arabic and Hebrew speakers stick with the simple continence plus the extended consonant vowel mothers. The optional helper dots get thrown in like a life preserver for struggling learners or careful text, but grownups don't need them anymore.
