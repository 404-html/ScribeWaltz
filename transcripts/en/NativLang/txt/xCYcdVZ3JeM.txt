Speaker 1:          00:00          France loves French, it's quite possible. There's no other country on earth this proud of its linguistic heritage. So in light of the attacks just days ago, perhaps there's no tribute to Paris, more Parisian and spending some time grammar checking. Isis is French. Well, the world takes in the shock of the Paris attacks. News comes in from friends telling us there's a letter from the Islamic state claiming full responsibility and in perfect French, nonetheless, always eager to justify my underused degree in romance languages. I had to see what counts is perfect French these days. Tracking down an image of the communique in just a few clicks. I it and prepared to read my way through what I would sure would be a brief declaration of religious war against the infidels. Perfectly polished by some middlemen translator giving me that stellar French I was promised and at first I think I got what I expected or religious dedication, sacred versa and explanation of the attacks.

Speaker 1:          00:58          But handful of sentences in some linguistic doubts bubbled up. Yes, mandatory references to align the caliphate, but wanting humiliating his enemies. You mean wanting to humiliate? Okay. A La has conquered by their hand and to cast fear in the heart of the Crusaders we was all that has conquered by their handed has cast fear in the heart of the Crusaders. Okay. This is actually a pretty common mistake that I see. These are actually homogenous and French, so maybe that makes some sense, but it's definitely not polished. The bet that canal or hundreds of idolaters we're gathered where hundreds of idolaters, not to mention the buttock loan is all small like it's a familiar place in the city and not a proper noun. Sometimes I don't even know who you'd be. Nuances at tech, the result of his attacks. Did you misspell visa tax? Is this talking about their attacks, but you used the singular instead of the plural?

Speaker 1:          01:56          Did you get confused by just having mentioned say clue? It's streets. The streets of Paris and the previous sentence, I can't tell since. See here, granted them what they were hoping for. The martyr martyrdom may all I accept them. I'm on the martyrs and they allow us to join them. He allow by far the parts of this thing with the lowest linguistic weirdness factor or the top and bottom verses from the Koran copied punctuation at all from as far as I can track it down, this French translation by Mohammed Hmi Doula, a prolific writer and language lover in his own right, but let's be honest, it's a good bet. They were pasted from one of the free online sites that come up here. They were even kind enough to start it off with this same little blessing. There's so much strangeness to it. I think some of that linguistic strangeness pops out in Just One word.

Speaker 1:          02:48          This is the word Suda. Sarah is a typical feminine known in Arabic and like so many feminine nouns. It comes built in with what they call an attached t in the word Sarah. That attached talk gives away the gender, but make a note that tall isn't pronounced when the word is on its own like this. Instead, it's a silent t that shows up in speech only when the word takes other forms. Other endings like when it's the subject of a sentence, there's a different noun form for that and Arabic. And that's where the difference comes in between the English pronunciation of this word Sura the Nae devised English way to pronounce that Arabic word on its own with the silent t and the French pronunciation, nuts, Syrah. But sue hats from the form with the nuts. So silent t, but this guy doesn't write the French word so hot.

Speaker 1:          03:38          He writes it this way. It looks similar to your highs, but it caught me off guard first. There's this funny hat, it's a circumflex. Vowels often wear that hat is a decorative piece of French language history. The leftover crumbs of a French sound that used to be there but isn't anymore. The French word beast, for example, earned itself. That happened when he got rid of its s long time ago. The word for sure in French gained it circumflex by losing its inner e and that's after it had already erased. It's Latins see that it had long ago. So what sounded Sura Losing French? Well, none. There's an even bigger clue here. There's that missing e at the end, just like an English. Well, almost like an English. The final e can be silent in French, but that doesn't mean it has no impact on the language. It does something to the letter before it.

Speaker 1:          04:30          See, there are a lot of consonants that just don't get pronounced when they're at the end of a French word. It's why as Jack and blowhole aren't Jackson poor rot, but when that he makes its way onto the end of a word with a silent t, it stays silent. Bull, the tea gets pronounced. So in sue got the final, he lets us have our tea, but lop off that finally, and I promise you, any French reader will pronounce this as a silent t. This word is so raw and that's where it gets strange to see if this righteous tongue rider is all about French or his translator on retainer is Sukha is a lot harder to justify. But if he's imitating the Arabic pronunciation of the word in isolation, Swa suddenly becomes a plausible spelling. On the other hand, this spelling isn't at all what I'd expect if someone were just translating literally from Arabic.

Speaker 1:          05:23          It shows a familiarity with native Ising Arabic words into French in a way that tells us something about the culture of that native arising process. Making analogies with other French words that come to mind and even extending circumflex is in a standardized academic way to compensate for that Arabic long val and it's that Arabic minded circumflex that makes sense when you consider two other facts. One, the few other examples we can find touting this spelling our shakes and institutes citing specific verses in their lectures or people setting themselves up as instructors teaching you something from the Koran, always leaning into that formal Arabic even when they're preaching in another tongue to Islam. Specifically this way of spelling Islam this way is leaning into yet another Arabic long val. Now, I don't mean to mislead you into thinking that this is all a bunch of lurking Arabic seeping through.

Speaker 1:          06:14          That's not what swipe is telling us. This isn't the dictionary French word, but it's not the dictionary Arabic word either. This is too productive for a literal translation for a broader audience, but it's also to communal for a case of personal creativity. And my hunch right now is it, this is the root of my feeling of strangeness. This is where the language of this communique begins to unravel, giving us a glimpse of the writer as well as other targets in the 10th the 11th the 18th Allen Small and this simultaneously, my reading's not English enough, it's too close to the original, but zoom in here closer. The writer knows he's about to list a bunch of targets so it uses the plural, but then in mid sentence he turns to break this list up and just three singular targets and he finishes it all up with this journalistic.

Speaker 1:          07:03          But wait, there's more back reference tweak. It's like the first draft of a stop and go news report tripping over itself and it's all laced with the stream of condemnation. So constant that it's almost as if the terms were just the only words available at the time and the mind of the writer, France and Germany are the two crusader countries also allowed the idiot of France. There are miscreants. There's perversion, there's a motive wanting and hoping and shooting and how dare you. Ing of modal verbs dressed up as statements of fact and of course the threat of more to come would all sound so over the top if only it weren't so fresh. This is the product of a mind that knows French. Yes, but one that makes linguistic mistakes, linguistic mistakes that showcase in idiosyncratic language that's closer to a certain kind of community speech of a near of Arabic style and simple full puff fumblings with political, French News, announcement delivery.

Speaker 1:          08:00          It's so much closer to those things than it is to what I was naive promised would be a clear example of perfect French, but maybe my language is too flower. You're stylized here. This is what I mean. It's a heat. He sets himself up as a preacher, but a preacher that's more easier than, than meticulous. And while he is someone that wants to instruct you, even preach to you, is this on the scholar a translator? Even though he likes to incorporate teaks of religious scholarship, he's from a subculture that readily Arab rather than color sizes, Arabic borrowings into French. He distances himself from his surroundings playing both moral judge and factual reporter. He knows Punam the city of lights well enough to be disgusted by specifics, but he's probably not the translator. He's the author.

Speaker 2:          08:57          Yeah.
