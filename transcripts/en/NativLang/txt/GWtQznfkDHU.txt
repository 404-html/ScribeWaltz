Speaker 1:          00:00          The conquest of Mexico. Yes, it plagues it took guns. It took steel, but as the Spanish admitted would have gone very differently without languages. 1510 mezo America, Audi's to spoke Maya and lived in a small kingdom, run by its own real man. Seriously. A local mine leader was a holiday week. A real man west of the Maya. Many people spoke many languages from many language families will domi support tech Turtleneck, but one group's been taking over. You know who straight from the Valley of Mexico where the triple alliance, you dare not defy us. The Aztecs, their empire was built around. I've Tippett city states each one led by Inc Latwonda the speaker, but one I'll tip it stood above the rest. They know which deet land. A huge city floating on a lake, home of high temples, human sacrifice and the Aztec empires way eat [inaudible]. Great Speaker. The current way [inaudible] is Martech Soma Montezuma to you.

Speaker 1:          01:03          He demands tribute from all of this area or else or else flush Gulen. Their name may start with a very Aztec, but make no mistake clash. Scala is a proud and independent warrior state. Pay Up to him. We'll take Soma and rest easy. Stay free, but constantly watch your back for as take obsidian. Flesh color says bring it. I keep saying as tech, but let's talk names as text means all people from the legendary homeland Aztlan at least it doesn't. The Aztec language linguists call that language. Know what TL and the related peoples are. No one, but that's just a way to say speaking clearly for their part. The epic as ticks of Aztec Empire fame called themselves may Shika and their land was Ms Sheeko, Mexico. The well, we're over here debating terminology. The bearded men start to arrive from the east and events unfold that will conspire to put now what will end Maya into the hands of Mexico's conquerors.

Speaker 1:          02:00          1511 a shipwreck Spanish crew washes up on the coast of the Yucatan and is captured by Mayans too will survive. I get it at a fryer and the sailor get rid of 1513 tubs school. He's the Halloweeny could gave his name to Tabasco. The state end, the Chili. He battles nearby Shika Longo and take slaves as a reward among them. Is Malina. Lee and no one girl who also spoke to on Pal Maya, the kind of mine in that part of the Gulf coast, 1517 bearded men, Cordova lands in the Yucatan, he's greeted, warmly welcomed by the Maya success. Nope. Turns out it's an ambush, the Spanish retreat, but managed to nab a mine on the way out. Maybe George Echo, he'll be there first Mayan translator, but a rough one and one will never buy into this whole Spain thing. 1518, another explorer. Grehalva takes military junta visit tab scope who trades gifts and tells tales of a wonderful land, the west with many more treasures, a land called Michiko.

Speaker 1:          03:03          The curious Grehalva says, hmm, maybe I'll stick around a bit, but tubs, scopes been warned by my and allies to keep these guys that distance and says, I think it's time for you to move along Cuba 1519. This is where the bearded men have been sailing from. One of them just emptied his life savings to pay for boats and crew to um, explore the fabled riches of Mexico in Non Cortez Cortez sales. Tuku Samil Cozumel and sends out Middle Georgia who to track down those two shipwreck survivors, the sailor, well, he's gone for good, not dead. Turns out he went full lion. Seriously, he became a champion warlord, but the other guy I be loud is still alive and his heart's still belongs to Spain. The fryer's back in action. My in captivity turned [inaudible] ladder into a real asset. See, the Spanish haven't been big on local languages. Case in point, they use a word they learn back in Cuba for every local chief, they meet Gas Siki.

Speaker 1:          03:59          You're a Mayan Winnick [inaudible] a Mexican plateau. [inaudible] the weight La 20 of the whole empire gas CK, but not like he lied. He speaks junk down. Maya now, well, it's John Delta outsiders because he has Aztec word junk. Fairly means foreigner. We speak clearly. They on the other hand, they speak like foreigners. You know what I mean? The people of Tabasco clearly disagree because to them it's yokoten correct language, whether you call it, I get a lot of speech for inner correct. Cortez immediately sees his value, keeps him by his side and makes him his language, his tongue. Great time to talk to more mines, starting with tubs, Kolbe, but I don't think his town's taking to the idea of even more bearded men showing up. Seriously. These guys again, no thanks. They put up quite a fight, but with a little mine, Intel and a big display of horsepower.

Speaker 1:          04:49          This Spanish to feed them in the battle of settler tubs, school berries is dead and hands over a bounty bounty. That includes that woman tab scrub captured in 1513 Molly, Natalie, this woman has a way with words, not only can she speak with [inaudible], she knows the Mexican language. Also too many names. Malina Lee took a Spanish name, Donya Medina, which got translated back into now what we're with an honorific is suffix. Seen Marlene scene that came back into Spanish as Mcglinchey, which is how she still remembered in Mexico, who Cortez now has a strategy. He and idealabs speak Spanish to each other. I get a lot of turns to Mallinson scene and speaks. Maya and Mylene seen uses now what with the Aztecs? Until she eventually learned Spanish then, sorry, Aggie life. You're out. Go team. Laneless. Why the long chain of communication though? Why can't I get loud?

Speaker 1:          05:42          Just pick up some Aztec because classical, now what? And Sean Paul. Maya come from two completely distinct language families. It's like Chinese and English sort of. See, there's a unique linguistic mixing that happened in Mesoamerica, but that's so cool. I'll save it for another video with his linguists always by his side. Go test begins to unravel the resentment beneath the surface. See, I don't know how you pictured it, but this is not going to be a small band of Spaniards standing alone against an empire. Success hinges on flipping allies. Lots and lots of allies. That's where team linguist comes in. Spain flips the total knacks. They down play in fighting and scuttle their own ships to go. All in. They learn of blush color. They dare to enter to blush color. The ferocious flush colon warriors put up a major fight, but the Spanish impressed the guest seek gay and earn themselves a deeply loyal ally against the Mashika.

Speaker 1:          06:34          The enemy of my enemy is my Maleen seen flipping towns and butchering others. This allied crew pushes on to 10 which deadline knock knock Multex Soma, and in November of 1519 well, Dick Soma opens, they enter the biggest, the most impressive city they've ever seen. The weight latony is carried out to them and team linguists makes history and an awkwardly gracious meeting between worlds. We'll Texoma then launches into a flowery NovoTAL. That's up for interpretation, but I think we'll come back to haunt the city. Take the word for city state from earlier. I'll tip it. It literally means water hill. Now listen to this line from well Texoma. The Mutsun in motivates Betsy. Matson and [inaudible] have the same roots, water and hill plus the same formal scene at the end of Marlene scene. It's your water, Sir and your hills sir. He symbolically offering the city to Cortez, well to master lean shit.

Speaker 1:          07:33          See, the Aztecs are addressing team linguist not as Cortez, but as Marlene sin. They even painted the pair side by side in their own codices with her as the speaker from here. The history of this conquest turns more tactical than linguistic. Cortez takes more Texoma hostage months of puppet ruler broken by a brutal Spanish attack during the holiday of Bullsh Scott that unleashes and as tick uprising, which ends in the death of Mattec Soma and many, many Spaniards in allies as they flee the city. Regrouping and flush collar team language secures more reinforcements and performs a linguistic trick. See test interpreted Mattec Somas poetic speech in Matson in both the bed senior has him handing the empire over. If Spain was the rifle master that makes the Aztecs officially, uh, people in rebellion thus follows the vengeful recruiting of even more allies and the outbreak of a major plague.

Speaker 1:          08:28          The empire shatters into basically a civil war in central Mexico that implodes into a final siege on thin watch. Dateline a seizure that lasts the summer of 1521 cost hundreds of thousands of lives and ends with the city in ruins while demo the final weight. [inaudible] is spared only to be executed by Cortez a few years later before his death. He speaks out with Aztec defiance. Oh, captain McGlinchey long have I understood? Have I known your false words? Duplicity today in Mexico. That's the kind of sting that the name Marlene Shay has Maleen cheese. You trade your own culture for a taste of something foreign, but heroes, villains, or players in a clash between two great empires, translators were key in the conquest of Mexico. Maleen seeing above all, I'll be back soon to compare as tick versus my in grammar and in revel. Peculiar linguistic secret about Mullin scenes. Mexico, stick around and subscribe for language.
