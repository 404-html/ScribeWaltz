Speaker 1:          00:00          At the end of the last animation I asked you to share your own stories of uneven understanding share. You did more than I could have imagined. We built one of the Web's largest collection of asymmetric intelligibility stories right there in the comments. You also called me out. Could I maybe share something personal about my journey into language? That's something patrons have asked for two, since we have a bit of downtime. Today's a good day to do that. In my life, there hasn't just been one thing that connected me to language. It's been a bunch of small moments, little experiences. Some of these end up in my videos, so I guess keep watching to get the full story, but if I'm sharing personal experiences, it might have to be this one. It's not what I expected today, but there are events, struggles, things in my earlier life. I wouldn't be here without.

Speaker 1:          01:00          These are my scars. Literally scars at the time. It's so superficial, but as a kid I was kind of shy. It's something I slowly grew out of, thanks to a happy family team, sports, great friends until I ran into that life wall called adolescence. And that means different things to different teens. I got some of the normal awkwardness and acne, but on top of that I began to get serious scabs and rashes and worse all over my face, my hands and my neck. I tried to cover it up or at least play it off. I couldn't always find ways to cope. Uh, I'd make it through a school day and I had rushed to be alone, study or draw, ride my bike off on my own on tough days. I remember sitting behind bus benches instead of waiting up front like a normal person, just so my latest scars weren't out there for everyone to see.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Why am I telling you this? Because it mattered. I was uncomfortable and struggling to find worth in my own skin and that made it tough to connect superficially. I had to look past my skin in lean on ways I knew to connect on a deeper level. I did this with language. It helped me relate to people, people with their own scars, people who pass it and present, opened up and shared stories of languages and cultures with me. They gave me riches more meaningful than if I'd never had this struggle. Eventually it took years, but eventually I got a diagnosis. My skin was sensitive to fragrances, laundry, deodorant, Cologne, shampoo, hair products, washing dishes. They were all leaving scars. I made changes and the scars healed. That's what they do. I, the day my mom helped me take off my sheets and wash everything and fragrance free detergent.

Speaker 1:          03:04          I got to leave it behind usually for my skin and definitely from my mind what the clucks tick and scars fade. I get to make up for lost time for the most part I've moved on, which is one reason why these videos take awhile. Yes, animation is a thing that takes time. I've learned how true that is, but there's more to my story in an effort to be a productive part of our future world and pay for those hand baskets of food. I've been on my own years long journey to be a better programmer. Maybe a bit later in life than I expected. But while you've been watching, I've been putting in the work, taking classes, getting certified coding projects. This balancing act doesn't pay well, but in many other ways it's been rewarding. It even shapes the videos you watch now. The part of my journey that would become native Lang is another story when I shared with patrons, but I'm compelled to keep coming back partly because of those earlier days when language distracted me from my scars. Well, I've talked about where I've been. What about you? What is language meant to you? Was there a little moment or a meaningful experience? I offer patrons much gratitude for all your support, and thank you for sticking around in subscribing for language.
