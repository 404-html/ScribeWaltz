Speaker 1:          00:00          Alone. Mysterious texts teases your curiosity. You're in a dark room. Let's say an amusing basement. No, even better. Some were more adventurous. A cave. Yeah. Your excitement fades to baffled. Wonder as your brain starts to hum with the tedium of cracking this text, a tedium that call's not for the brazen and venturing of an Indiana Jones, but the careful testing of a touring or sample, you don't. You don't know the language of this text. You don't even know what words it encodes. You can't even start to pronounce it. Symbols. You're not even sure this is writing at this moment of confusion. If your ear is free, fellow language traveler and budding decipher. Let me hold out my hand and offer a morsel of hope. What if I told you that you can know what these symbols are without ever needing to know how to read them?

Speaker 1:          00:47          And what if I also told you all you needed to do this was to know how to count first pluck out the basic writing types you met in thoughts pill. What? You haven't seen that? No Way. Come on, let's go watch it first and then come back and pluck out the basic writing types you met in thoughts, pill, consonant, or vowel symbols, syllable symbols, and words. Symbols. Now let's start counting. Take a string in English, just a bit of written text and count the number of distinct graphings you find it. Okay, but longer is better here. More chances for all the signs and the writing system to show up, including those less common ones. You know your Qs, your ex's jerseys. So let's count the signs in all of Shakespeare's sonnets. I'm counting everything but x. So keep taking more and more bigger and bigger samples in English.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And you'll end up counting the 26 letters of our alphabet. Do the same for Russian. And I hear you. Account 33 try it with Hawaiian and you only find 13 now reach for Japanese text written entirely in syllables. You'll count 46 Hiragana Cherokee has 85 the syllables. Wow. Now here's a jump up to Hittite with over 500 symbols. Maya, with more than 800 and Chinese with thousands upon thousands. So we ended up with alphabets on one end, silver berries in the middle end logo graphic or logo, phonetic scripts on the far side. But now you're facing a new script, totally unknown to you, and you count the symbols. It has hundreds. What kind of script do you think it is? What if it has 20 what if it has 50 or 60 we're using this simple algorithm to make an educated guess about an unknown script. Ms Things referenced conceptually and papers about decipherment, but I don't know what it's called.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Robinson points us back to Archibald. Say someone who loved himself, some a Syrian. So do we call it the safe test? The Archibald heuristic pulling a space? Yeah. Pulling a sakes. Pulling US space does come with challenges and drawbacks to first, there's the problem that you still can't read the text. True, but before you take all of the wind out of my sails, please celebrate what this handy tool can do for you. Second scripts can emphasize things, but they're not really purely phonetic or pure loga graphs. I mean, think of the mix of letters and numbers, punctuation, and even idiot graphs you find all around you and that's just an English. Perhaps the biggest problem is how do identify distinct symbols? If you were trying to decipher the Latin alphabet, could you tell that all of these are the same symbol? How? What about capital letters and lowercase letters?

Speaker 1:          03:25          Our accent marks distinct letters. How do we count ligatures linked, scripted together, mashed together characters or the component consonant vowel pieces of a single index syllable or the sound plus meaning pieces inside of a single Chinese character. We have explanations for these and maybe they're good enough for the scripts we already know, but what about trying to read an undecipherable script like real no Romo? Are these strange people looking things to flipped a variance of a single sign or are they two different sites? True. I admitted this little algorithm doesn't pull us out of the dark, but it gives us a starting point. We can identify script types. We can list symbols. We can then use these lists to identify the symbols when they show up in other texts with a smile on our face. Because even though this script is still unknown to us, we've devised a clever way to reach a strange familiarity with it. A big step on our way to decipher it. I took a little time to play around with and put together some simple code that runs this test on any piece of texts you give it. It counts the number of different symbols that are in that text. Then uses those cutoff numbers from earlier to guess what kind of writing system this is.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:52          so let's try it for English, the English alphabet. Here's the 26 English letters. We'll pass it down through here and run this thing. It tells us that English is an alphabet who'd have thought. Same thing, but with some random sentences. Still an alphabet. Let's go for here. A gun at down here, run it and it's syllables. What about Hawaiian? If you two have ever shared the misfortune of leaving Hawaii, you may have heard this and it's in an alphabet, and then there's Kanji. Oh yes. Oh, whole list of them and their words, symbols. Well, that's super nerdy, but thanks for letting me play with language a bit here. It's kind of Nice doing more off the cuff video like this. It's a thing right off the cuff. It's sounded wrong for some reason. Well, leave comments and subscribe and encourage me to come back again. Okay, bye.
