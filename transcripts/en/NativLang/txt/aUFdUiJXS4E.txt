Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:11          Here's the language and heres a brain, and this is a brain on language. Just look at this brain in case you're not up to date on all the sites. There's a whole lot going on here. There are neurons and glial cells, capillaries and myelinated axons. All this anatomy, but the sexiest stuff to focus on has been the nerve cells in your cerebral cortex. That's this outside layer here. The inside looks whitish. This stuff looks gray. Hence the terms of white matter and gray matter. The first real evidence of the brain's role in language came not from observing normal healthy brains using language but from damaged brains. This started back in the 18 hundreds when pioneering researchers dissected the brains of a phase JAKKS. The ancient Greek word, uh, pasea simply means speechlessness patients suffering from Aphasia have head injuries that disrupt their abilities to understand or produce speech.

Speaker 2:          01:22          It turns out that specific linguistic difficulties were associated with lesions in specific parts of the cortex. The logic involved in pinning down these language centers of the brain is pretty simple. If someone doing action a has a healthy region be, but someone else who has damaged to region B can't do a, then it looks like region B is necessary for action. A in 1861 of French surgeon named Bull Balka began to study the brains of a phase yaks and hunted down just such a region, apparently crucial for speech production. A region we today called Broca's area inspired by broke his findings, a German doctor, an anatomist Carl van Nica, went and found another such region. This one linked to linguistic understanding, as you might've guessed, that region is called Venegas area. A little side note for you, anatomy buffs or anyone looking for extra credit. Today's most widely used system for cutting the brain into regions was proposed by another German anatomist Corbion Broadman.

Speaker 2:          02:42          This outer surface of the brain we've been admiring has over two dozen of these Broadman area's brokers, corresponds to Broadman area's 45 and 44 well 22 his home to Veronica's area in your brain specifically. Both of these are most likely in your left hemisphere with all of the technological leaps forward we've made in brain imaging since broke his day looking inside the brain to see what's lighting up where has obviously become even more important, but don't let the Uffizi acts mislead you. What we're searching for inside the brain isn't necessarily straight forward. The way researchers speak about it, it's not as if neuroimaging gives us the exact brain location of language or have love or any other human concept. Instead we get to see the areas of the brain, the activation of the actual brain cells that are involved in performing a task. These days. There are two fields that tackle our topic of the day where teachers language on a burn, and Chris, you've already forgotten the first one.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Neuro linguistics makes an entire discipline out of the kind of research we've been chatting about cycle linguistics or related field, as the name implies is crazy about language, but it takes on general questions like how do humans acquire language and how do humans speak and understand with a focus on the role of the mind in these activities. The two fields inform each other, meaning that there's a high degree of interdisciplinarity here with all this stuff about the brain going through your brain. Think for a minute about two 20th century models of language in model number one, human language is a collection of behaviors that are conditioned by external stimuli. Verbal behavior, language that gets a favorable response will be reinforced and repeated. This is a perspective called behaviorism and it places the brain in a background role. Model number two is a very popular linguistic model of language known as nativism.

Speaker 2:          05:04          It holds that language is an innate mental faculty. Grammar isn't just a linguistic concept anymore. It's actually born into every healthy human brain, but instead of marginalizing the brain by focusing on external behavior and operant conditioning, and instead of bringing linguistics to the brain by mapping grammatical concepts onto brain areas, perhaps we could be a little more considerate of what the brain is actually doing. When we articulate our understanding of language. Yes. Being that specific with our familiar general academic terms will require a bit more intellectual muscle than ignoring the brain or slapping stickers like language, grammar, speech on to some part of your cortex, but consider it an invitation, an invitation. Get to know your brain and your brain on language a bit better. Thanks for learning with me.
