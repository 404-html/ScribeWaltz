Speaker 1:          00:15          Allophone and minimal parents. You're going to need those concepts to start examining the phonology of Latin American Spanish. We'll start with minimal pairs, which will allow us to document the phoneme inventory of Spanish. Such an inventory should contain all major contrasting phonemes. Here are five words that differ minimally be so basal basle puzzle puzzle. We can infer that e a r o n o r vowel phonemes. If we compare to other words, we'd find that this holds up other minimal pairs. Confirm that these five vowels are distinct from one another and that there isn't a sixth or a seventh foul beyond these five that contrasts with them. Next we'll move on to diphthongs Spanish diphthongs start or end with the high vowels so he or Ooh, here we'll find examples of free variation since the diphthongs sometimes have a short vowel e or Ooh, but other times have a more restricted glide.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Yeah, or what Gwyn that or Quinta qual or quant CN or seeing the Gfsi or Gaussi. If we turn to focus on the consonants, we find many minimal pairs demonstrating that Spanish as far more consonant phonemes than vowel phonemes and if we keep comparing minimal pairs, we'll have a list of how many and what kind of consonant phonemes Spanish has. At that point we can drop a table of all those consonants arranged by place of articulation, manner of articulation and voicing. I'm sure you remember those terms from the IPA for language learning, but if not head back to those lessons for review. Now we have a tidy answer to the basic question. How many different sounds of Spanish have we answered that by finding minimal pairs, Spanish words that differ by only one sound lead us to think that these are all different sounds in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Phonemes contrast with each other. At least they did an arm, minimal pairs, but what about sounds that don't contrast as you listen more closely to Latin American Spanish, you'll notice that the pronunciation of many of these phonemes varies depending on context. You'll hear and pronounced aim in embodies, but not in. In Hispana you'll hear Gusto, but not a disaster. But you'll hear gas asto and not get Gusto. You'll hear dwelling, but not the way late. And you'll hear ms Wally, but not mid dwelling. You'll hear Baca and not Laka, but you'll hear Lavacca and not blah. On the other hand, you'll hear some speakers say Kylie and others say Kylie. Some will say, may Jamo and others made jam and some Mucho, but others Musha. What do these allophones suggest about the pronunciation system of Spanish? Come back next time to expand your understanding of phonology.

Speaker 2:          03:27          Yeah.
