1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,190
Away from our,
from Dan price

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,710
in some cases,
seasoning to believe that a founding as

3
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:23,300
possible.
Some people think that it's not possible

4
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:26,840
to have permanent principles or
semipermanent principles,

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,660
but that everything changes with
history.

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,610
And so you have something called the
living constitution or a kind of

7
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:39,290
historicized constitution that the
progressive's first thought of,

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,760
uh,
in,

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,470
uh,
in the early 19th century.

10
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:45,170
Woodrow Wilson is a great example of
that.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,630
And I,
I think that's a very popular view

12
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,400
today.
And yet,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,130
uh,
when it comes down to crises,

14
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,730
I think people look at our three
branches of government,

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,180
the separation of powers,
uh,

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,670
the fact that we have representatives
for limited terms,

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,870
all these fundamental things in our
constitution and hold on to them

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,750
lamb.
And still,

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,130
I'm still believe that.
