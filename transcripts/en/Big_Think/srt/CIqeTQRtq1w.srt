1
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,560
I think there is,
there are some interesting faces,

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,873
um,

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,150
where people get it wrong and we know
why they got it wrong.

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,340
And this,
and this often occurs in the case when

5
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:33,150
you have very distinctive items.
And so this is one of the things that

6
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:36,040
once you kind of get expert at it,
you've got to watch out for cause it

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,500
cause as I say,
we are,

8
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,330
what we're looking for is we're looking
for patterns.

9
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:44,100
We're looking for overall patterns and
things that are distinctive by,

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,210
by nature of being distinct.
They're inconsistent with a patent,

11
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,790
but they'd draw your attention.
So we went into one of the rooms,

12
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:54,510
we went into everything,
indicated it was a socially responsible

13
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,120
person who was um,
uh,

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,580
a nice person.
Um,

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,530
they were um,
uh,

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,600
uh,
organized and together and um,

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,330
uh,
not that reckless.

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,130
We are pretty sort of conservative in
many ways.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,590
Yet in the corner of the room there was
a plastic crate full of drug

20
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:20,520
paraphernalia or a bong for smoking
marijuana and stuff like that.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,420
And of course the judges come in and
they see that which sticks out and they

22
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,390
go straight over to it and I likely to
interpret it,

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,941
you know,
make,

24
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,300
draw strong inferences from it.
Of course,

25
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,710
the very reason that makes it stick out
is the very reason they should have

26
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,140
ignored it.
And it turns out when I later found out

27
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:37,910
what was,
what was,

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,800
what was it doing there?
It turns out that this person was

29
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,300
holding onto the,
um,

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,730
uh,
have a roommate had gone traveling

31
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,630
around the world and tech.
Could you look after this stuff's good?

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:46,981
Yeah,
sure.

33
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,600
I'll put it on.
She put it responsibly,

34
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,340
put it in a crate and put it in the
corner of the room.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,811
So,
you know,

36
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
it was,

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,020
it was consistent with above 90,
but not in the way you were thinking.
