1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,850
I think the most important thing about
an astronaut is,

2
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:14,510
is you know,
you have to take for first of all,

3
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:18,620
take for a given.
That's a person's done pretty well at

4
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:19,230
school,
you know,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,390
has a,
has the intelligence and all that to,

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:23,620
to learn new systems and new things.
Uh,

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,730
but after that,
the most important thing I think is

8
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:27,290
being able to get along with others,
you know,

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,240
flexibility and teamwork,
uh,

10
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:32,840
those issues because as we get flight
longer and longer and space,

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,910
those,
those are really important factors.

12
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:36,320
Even on short shuttle missions.
You know,

13
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,290
those are important factors to put a
crew together that can work together

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,150
effectively as a team that can get
along.

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,610
And so I think for an individual,
um,

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,680
you know,
I think the most important thing is

17
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:46,850
being able to work with others.

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,640
You know,
NASA interest,

19
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:55,870
stealing hadn't done that much until
fairly recently because we'd always

20
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:58,720
flown short missions and we're all
professionals and,

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,650
and,
uh,

22
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,820
the thinking as well,
you know,

23
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:02,990
everyone get along for a,
you know,

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,300
two week mission,
right?

25
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,530
And so,
and everyone can,

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,380
so it hasn't really been a problem.
The Russians had been flying long

27
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,810
duration cruise since the early
seventies.

28
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,920
And in the early days they've ended at
least two missions early because of

29
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,710
conflicts within the crew.
So they learned early on the importance

30
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,680
of studying this and making sure you put
the right crew together.

31
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,940
Uh,
since our,

32
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,700
we began our work together on the
international space station with the

33
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,290
Russians in the,
um,

34
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,483
you know,
early,

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,770
early two thousands.
We've started to,

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,830
NASA has started to learn the importance
of this kind of work.

37
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:36,940
And so NASA is looking much more into it
and funding more work into this,

38
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:39,040
uh,
through both directly by NASA as well as

39
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,640
through the NSP Ri.
And so I think it's important work and

40
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,700
we are now fully on board and
recognizing that it's important

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,200
[inaudible].
