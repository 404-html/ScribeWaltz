00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,890
Hey Bill,
I'm Haitian.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,820
I'm an eighth grader at Joel peanuts in
middle school and I was wondering why do

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:15,350
people have favorites if our brains
offers you really grow the same,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
shouldn't we all have the same
favorites?

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,840
Aren't we all the same donor?
Our brains all grow the same.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,350
The answer is no and yes it is to say we
have much more like a,

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,890
we are much more alike than we are
different.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,070
This old question,
if I see red,

9
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:40,071
is it the same to you as it is to me?
Like what I think is red is really green

10
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:44,910
and your brain just learns to call what
you're a green is my red and so on.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,730
Okay.
These are good questions but I think the

12
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,640
reason we have favorites is that we all
are slightly different.

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,310
We do not look identical.
We are not biological clones.

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,940
Everybody is a little different.
Everybody is exposed to different

15
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:06,330
experiences and different chemicals,
different things in the air and water as

16
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:09,330
you grow up.
So what you prefer and food,

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,260
uh,
could change from one place to another

18
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,520
based on your environment.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,230
And everybody's genes are different.
The read.

20
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:23,231
One exception might be identical twins,
but everybody's genes are different.

21
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,370
And so what we prefer,
what we like,

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,210
what we find is favorites is different
from one person to another,

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,090
but if nothing else I have learned in
life,

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,530
people are a heck of a lot more alike
than they are different.

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,060
You'll find that if you like a yummy
chocolate dessert,

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,480
it's very likely that someone else will
like that yummy chocolate dessert that

27
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:51,720
your favorites you'll be,
you may be surprised are favored by a

28
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:54,540
great many people.
When you get into

29
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,980
disagreements,
it's often I think a result of your

30
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,860
experiences.
Like I've had great experiences eating

31
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,220
ice cream with honey,
vanilla ice cream with honey.

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,880
Every time I think about it,
I think about my dad and I have good

33
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,250
thoughts,
but there's other people who think

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,480
vanilla ice cream.
That's not an interesting enough to me,

35
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,690
honey.
That's too commonplace.

36
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,210
No,
I won't say I feel bad for you,

37
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,430
but that means more vanilla and honey
for me.

38
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,350
Uh,
that's a,

39
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:29,010
you'll find people more alike than they
are different and enjoy the favorite.

40
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,280
Celebrate these little differences.
That's part of what makes life fun.

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,810
Carry on.
