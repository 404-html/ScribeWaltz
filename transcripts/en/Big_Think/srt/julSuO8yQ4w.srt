00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,243
Bye

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,090
five ingredients that I always have on
hand you now as a salt and pepper deal

3
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:13,924
and then,
you know,

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,820
whereas that,
you know,

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,660
these days I have a lot of blue hill
farm is really gung ho into this milk

6
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,480
deal.
So like we have now nine cows that were

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,270
milking,
so I generally always have milk on hand.

8
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:30,190
This is a new thing but unpasteurized
beautiful milk and we're experimenting

9
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:31,450
with all this stuff with that.
So,

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,770
you know,
I would say three,

11
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,290
four and five is about something of
milk,

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,420
like either raw milk or,
or,

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,080
or butter which we're making from the
milk or ricotta cheese or Mozzarella

14
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:43,090
cheese.
Somebody that's coming out of the dairy

15
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,500
and that's coming from the land,
you know,

16
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:45,520
and that,
that,

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,040
that is exciting that,
you know,

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,640
we're using this the,
you know,

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,370
where I began.
Uh,

20
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,420
and we're,
we're,

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,430
we're expanding on it.
And uh,

22
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,280
and now in the kitchen,
I'm making things out of it.

23
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,840
That's it.
There is nothing more pleasurable to me

24
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,790
than,
than having that kind of connection.

25
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,350
And I hope to share that with,
with one Pico.
