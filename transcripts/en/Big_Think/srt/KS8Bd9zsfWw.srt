1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,200
Well I think you can really trace it
back to at least the 1960s,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,180
if not earlier.
Well,

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,900
what we started to see going on in
American politics in the 1960s and

4
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:18,620
continuing into the seventies and
eighties was really the disintegration

5
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,640
of the old new deal coalition,
uh,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,970
and alignment that had been,
uh,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,020
kind of put together by Franklin
Roosevelt and that sustained the

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,810
Democratic Party as the dominant party
in American politics for many years.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,840
Uh,
that coalition consisted of a number of

10
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,180
groups,
uh,

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,060
such as white southerners,
northern white ethnic voters,

12
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:43,280
and white working class voters,
um,

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,770
that,
um,

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,320
inherently had a little in common with
each other,

15
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,470
particularly when you add in,
um,

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,540
the growing representation of African
American voters after the 1960s with the

17
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:00,190
voting rights act.
Um,

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,660
so there's coalition was sort of
inherently unstable.

19
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:06,350
And what we began to see in the 1960s,
uh,

20
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:11,351
especially after the passage of the
voting rights act and the growth of the

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,850
African American electorate was that,
um,

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,880
the more conservative elements in that
coalition,

23
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,830
particularly white southerners,
but also,

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,230
um,
conservative white ethnic voters,

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
uh,
began to move,

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,250
uh,
towards the Republicans.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,460
Uh,
we had an ideological realignment that

28
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,500
began,
it didn't happen overnight.

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,450
It was a,
it was not something that occurred in

30
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:38,120
the single election or a couple of
elections.

31
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:40,610
It was something that took place over
several decades,

32
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,870
actually.
Uh,

33
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:46,871
but we gradually began to see these more
conservative voters moving away from the

34
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:49,880
Democrats and into the Republican camp.
Uh,

35
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,740
and on the other hand,
in response to that,

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,190
um,
more moderate to liberal voters,

37
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,290
uh,
who had been aligned with the

38
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,380
Republicans,
especially in parts of the country where

39
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:04,160
you had a moderate to liberal
republicans like the northeast,

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,480
um,
they began to move away from the

41
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:11,840
Republicans and toward the Democrats as
the Republican party became increasingly

42
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,570
conservative.
So you can see this beginning with

43
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,710
Richard Nixon southern strategy,
uh,

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,660
in 1972,
uh,

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,420
and continuing with Ronald Reagan's
presidential campaigns.

46
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,740
And then certainly in the 1990s with,
uh,

47
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,980
the,
uh,

48
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,960
takeover of the Republican Party in
Congress by I'm more conservative group

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,670
of leaders led by Newt Gingrich.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,750
So essentially what was happening here
was that,

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,580
uh,
at the elite level,

52
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,780
we were seeing increasing ideological
polarization and that change began to,

53
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,600
uh,
affect the loyalties of the voters,

54
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,030
uh,
and increasingly over time.

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,750
And by the time we got to the 1990s,
uh,

56
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:59,980
it had reached the point where,
um,

57
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,550
the,
uh,

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,510
old democratic coalition,
uh,

59
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,570
and the Democratic dominance of a,
at least congress was no longer no

60
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,190
longer existed.
Uh,

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,640
and it's really continued even up to the
present time.

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,720
Now,
something else that's been happening a

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,740
over this entire time period and
especially with the last couple of

64
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,170
decades,
it's also playing into this has been,

65
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,250
uh,
the demographic changes taking place in

66
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,730
the electric and the growing diversity
of the American Electric,

67
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,610
uh,
where non white voters are becoming a

68
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,330
larger and larger share of the
electorate.

69
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,140
Uh,
and particularly of the Democratic

70
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,020
Coalition,
so that by 2008,

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,810
when you look at the contributions of
different racial and ethnic groups to

72
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,850
the party coalitions,
you see that,

73
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,440
um,
nonwhites made up over 40% of democratic

74
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:00,274
voters.

75
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,980
Um,
whereas,

76
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,760
uh,
non whites were only about seven or 8%

77
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,400
of Republican voters,
you know,

78
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,770
so this is growing divergence between
the parties,

79
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,310
both in terms of their racial and
ethnic,

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,000
uh,
groups that support the parties.

81
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,510
And also in terms of ideology and
issues,

82
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,630
it's the more engaged segment of the
public that really becomes increasingly

83
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:36,631
polarized because they're the ones who
are really following these debates,

84
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:40,990
who are really attentive to what is
going on in the congress to the

85
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,550
positions of the parties.
Uh,

86
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,670
and so they tend to react much more
quickly than people who are just not,

87
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,480
you know,
not paying attention.

88
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,550
But what happens over time is that even
though this process of realignment

89
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,200
really was,
I think,

90
00:04:56,201 --> 00:05:00,730
initiated by political elites for
strategic reasons.

91
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:05,020
So you had Republican politicians in
particular who I think saw opportunities

92
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:09,880
to win over some of these voting groups
that had been traditionally supporting

93
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,714
the Democrats.

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,990
Um,
but once the public,

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,090
uh,
or at least the attentive segment of the

96
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:21,091
public becomes polarized,
that in turn sort of starts to constrain

97
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,560
the positions of political elites
themselves.

98
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,310
And now they have to reflect the views
of the voters who make up their,

99
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,030
uh,
their own base.

100
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,420
And so what we're seeing today is that
it's gotten to the point where the party

101
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:42,490
leaders and candidates for office are
really kind of constrained to a large

102
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:47,491
degree by the polarization that exists
among the attentive public.

103
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,520
So if you look,
for example,

104
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,110
at primary voters,
you find that,

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,990
you know,
Republican primary voters are really

106
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,750
quite conservative.
By enlarge democratic primary voters

107
00:05:55,751 --> 00:06:00,751
tend to be a fairly liberal and
therefore candidates who want to be

108
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,920
successful in politics,
you know,

109
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:08,990
have to appeal to these primary voters.
In addition,

110
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,500
um,
there are more and more congressional

111
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:17,501
districts and even states where one
party is dominant and therefore the key

112
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,411
to success in those types of districts.
And those types of states is,

113
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,080
again,
just to appeal to the party base and

114
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,630
there's less need to worry about
appealing to voters,

115
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,340
uh,
from the other party.

116
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:36,341
So political campaigns have become more
about mobilizing the base then about

117
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,730
appealing to the,
uh,

118
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,420
swing voters in the middle.

119
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,210
Yeah.
