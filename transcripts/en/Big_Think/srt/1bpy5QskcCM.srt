1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,530
Civil liberties are inherent human 
rights.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,200
Some people use the terminology,
terminology,

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,300
natural rights.
Uh,

4
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,050
I think,
uh,

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,883
a resonant passage that many people can 
relate to is the declaration of 

6
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:26,910
independence with one amendment.
You can guess a,

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,763
when it says all men are created equal 
and endowed by their creator with 

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,850
certain unalienable rights that among 
these are life,

9
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:35,700
liberty,
uh,

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,160
so forth and that too.
And that the purpose of government is to

11
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:40,994
secure these rights.
And that concept is repeated in the 

12
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:48,350
preamble to the constitution,
which sets forth the purposes of the new

13
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,184
government.
And one of them is to secure the 

14
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:55,640
blessings of liberty to ourselves and 
our posterity.

15
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:59,180
And again,
it doesn't say to provide liberty,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,570
uh,
to grant liberty to bestow it.

17
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:03,404
No,
we already are entitled to that by 

18
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:06,644
virtue of being born human rather than 
giving us liberty government's purpose 

19
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:14,030
is to protect the liberty that we 
already have.

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,660
Now it's one thing to say that on paper,
and I really,

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,430
you know,
for all the shortcomings,

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,270
I do think it really was an,
obviously we were nowhere close to those

23
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,104
ideals when the declaration was panned.
And yet it's so significant that those 

24
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,560
were the aspirations of this new 
government.

25
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:31,394
It was the first time in history that a 
government was dedicated to those 

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,800
libertarian and egalitarian ideals and 
the Hclu,

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,830
um,
uh,

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,290
founders recognize that,
uh,

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,410
these rights,
we're not going to be self executing,

30
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,244
that government officials were not 
necessarily spontaneously going to 

31
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,444
fulfill that responsibility to protect 
people's rights rather than suppressing 

32
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,854
their rights and,
and had this radical idea that they 

33
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:00,290
would actually do what's necessary,
uh,

34
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,400
to help people who first of all be aware
of what their rights are.

35
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,234
And secondly,
to do what's necessary to protect them 

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,400
through every possible means.
I think we're best known for litigation,

37
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:13,334
but from the beginning we have been 
extremely active in legislative arenas 

38
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:20,000
as well.
And in a public forum

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
to define

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,453
what is a civil liberty is quite similar
to what the United States Supreme Court 

41
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,620
does when it tries to interpret the word
liberty,

42
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:37,400
which appears in a couple of crucial 
passages in the constitution,

43
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,890
including in the bill of rights.
And,

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,190
uh,
but I do have to stress one difference,

45
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:48,191
which is the ACLU is not the American 
Constitutional Law Union.

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,350
People will often ask me,
you know,

47
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:55,730
why aren't you doing more to enforce the
second amendment or how we interpret the

48
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:57,560
Second Amendment,
the right to bear arms.

49
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,430
And,
uh,

50
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,910
you know,
for us the question is,

51
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,270
should something be a fundamental human 
right?

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,740
And if the constitution is a tool that 
we can use to enforce it,

53
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,574
fine.
But if the constitution does not avail 

54
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,170
to those purposes,
then we will look for another tool.

55
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
And let me give you one concrete example
and then I'll come back to the more 

56
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,520
abstract question.

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,260
Uh,
so for example,

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,153
and this surprises many people,
there is no constitutional right to be 

59
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,194
free from racial discrimination by any 
entity or individual aside from the 

60
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,614
government.
The constitution only applies to 

61
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,750
governmental actions.
And so therefore,

62
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:42,430
until we had the 1964 civil rights act,
private employers,

63
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,300
private restaurants,
private corporations,

64
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,770
landlords,
you name it,

65
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,723
we're completely free to discriminate in
the most blatant ways on any basis they 

66
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:58,180
chose including race.
The constitution simply did not apply.

67
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,590
The Aclu therefore lobbied very hard for
the civil rights law,

68
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,753
uh,
because we believe that there is a 

69
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,244
fundamental civil liberty to be free 
from racial and other forms of 

70
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,924
demographic discrimination when you're 
dealing with major aggregations of 

71
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,970
private power,
uh,

72
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,720
in the employment,
uh,

73
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,580
in the workplace,
in housing and so forth.

74
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,793
Uh,
so,

75
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,711
uh,
you know,

76
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:28,711
civil libertarians will debate and 
disagree among ourselves over particular

77
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,040
issues.

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,320
And it's certainly true that,
uh,

79
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,390
abortion,
to the best of my knowledge,

80
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:39,391
was not expressly on the ACL Ooh,
radar screen until sometime in the,

81
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,030
uh,
I believe 1960s.

82
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,864
And,
uh,

83
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,973
I do know this,
that the acl Ou was the first national 

84
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,324
organization to call for a woman's right
to choose an abortion to be protected 

85
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,224
under the constitution.
I think it's an organic outgrowth of 

86
00:04:58,991 --> 00:04:59,824
work that we had from the beginning.
One of our earliest clients back in the 

87
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:03,994
1920s,
our first decade of existence was 

88
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,920
Margaret Sanger.
We also represented Emma Goldman,

89
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,754
and these were two women who were 
advocating what I think of is exactly 

90
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,511
the same,
right?

91
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:18,511
Which is a woman's right to information 
and decisional autonomy,

92
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,590
uh,
uh,

93
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:24,010
about her reproductive options and,
uh,

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,873
medical information and assistance to 
carry out an informed choice in those 

95
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,244
areas.
