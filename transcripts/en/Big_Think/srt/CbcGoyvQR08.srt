1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,083
Oh

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,270
yeah.
I mean I read a whole book on

3
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:12,104
checklists.
He'd be,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,500
why in the world would anybody write a
whole book on checklists?

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,660
And,
and it was the last thing I thought I

6
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:22,010
would be writing about,
but I've been fascinated by how we

7
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:24,590
grapple with risk and complexity in
medicine.

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:29,090
And I got assigned a project to try to
find a way to reduce deaths in surgery.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,350
We,
um,

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,280
had been struggling with our
performance.

11
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:39,281
And so I started looking at how people
in other fields grapple with the

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,460
enormously increasing complexity that
people in professional worlds are

13
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:48,040
dealing with.
And what I found was in the aviation and

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,090
skyscraper building and other lines of
work,

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,300
that there was something really
fundamental going on.

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,930
We had transformed from a world where
ignorance was our biggest struggle as

17
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,340
human beings.
This is the way it was for millennia.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,740
We didn't understand why the human body
fails,

19
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,350
how to,
how to build things really well,

20
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,120
how to,
how to do many,

21
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:13,121
many kinds of tasks in the right way
that knowledge was missing today.

22
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,010
However,
our biggest struggle is with what people

23
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,980
call an aptitude.
Meaning the knowledge is there,

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,500
but somebody is not doing it right.
Um,

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,840
and in surgery,
in other parts of medicine,

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,690
what we're finding is that the amount of
knowledge,

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,610
the volume,
the complexity,

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,900
the tons of papers coming across the
transom,

29
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:43,460
the technologies that are proliferating,
that all of it has exceeded our

30
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:47,240
abilities as individuals to hold it all
in our head and do it right.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,770
And there are lots of fields,
it turns out where this has been

32
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,130
happening.
Um,

33
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,360
constructing buildings well,
uh,

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,590
in making good investment decisions by
hedge funds.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Um,
and when I looked to see how people who

36
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,360
actually are solving these problems,
we're solving it,

37
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,130
I thought you'd find that they had just
trained in a different way or they had,

38
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
they had,
they were training longer and harder.

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,960
They had a different kind of use of
technology.

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,380
Instead,
what I found over and over again was

41
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:26,381
they use checklists as simple and
mundane as it sounds that the checklist

42
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:30,650
in a way filled in for weaknesses in
people's brains,

43
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,870
things that they forgot.
Um,

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,380
it also filled in for weaknesses and
making teams work.

45
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,920
Teams constantly drop stuff between the
cracks.

46
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:42,470
And so we made a checklist based on what
I learned.

47
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,870
Actually I got folks from Boeing to help
us out.

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,300
How do you make a checklist?
I didn't think that that would be all

49
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,200
that hard.
It turned out to be hard and I'm,

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,670
one of the things they showed us was how
to,

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,300
how to really focus on making it swift
and usable.

52
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,730
We made a two minute surgery checklist,
had just 19 items.

53
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,520
Some of them were just make sure you
don't forget dumb stuff.

54
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,210
Make sure you gave antibiotics,
make sure you um,

55
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,760
have blood ready for a high blood loss
case.

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,650
And then there were other interesting
parts.

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,410
Um,
make sure everybody in the room has been

58
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,480
introduced by name and role.
Make sure the surgeon actually explained

59
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:21,730
to the team what their goals for the
operation are.

60
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,750
Make sure the anesthesiologist and nurse
had a chance to explain their plans for

61
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,630
the operation.
Um,

62
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,950
I put,
uh,

63
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,460
we put that checklist in eight hospitals
around the world ranging from rural

64
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:38,461
Tanzania to Toronto and Seattle and
every single hospital,

65
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,530
we put it in and had a double digit
reduction in complications.

66
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,540
The average reduction in death was 46%.
Um,

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
that made me realize there was something
much deeper and more important going on

68
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,580
here about this set of problems were
grappling with.

69
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,581
And in the modern world,
well on the one hand you'd say 0%.

70
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Um,
when you look at,

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,830
we have about 13,000 diagnoses.
We've recognized the human body to have

72
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,203
four.

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,630
We have 6,000 drugs,
4,000 different kinds of medical and

74
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,570
surgical procedures and the,
um,

75
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,250
and we know for each of them there's
anywhere from half a dozen to many dozen

76
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,970
steps that we should make sure are done
correctly.

77
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,610
Um,
and we just rely on human memory.

78
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,110
The person in the office that you go to
to just remember what that stuff is and

79
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,780
we drop stuff all the time.
A friend of mine went in for a

80
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:38,920
depression.
Uh,

81
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,700
she,
she was just becoming really low.

82
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,190
Uh,
the doctor put her on an antidepressant

83
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,200
and for next three years they're
changing antidepressants,

84
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,780
trying to get it right.
And it was only much later,

85
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:52,030
it's three years that they realize,
oh,

86
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,100
we didn't check your thyroid hormone
level.

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,470
And she just had low thyroid hormone
levels,

88
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,230
two weeks of thyroid hormone,
and she was better.

89
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:04,231
She lost three years because of that.
So the surgery checklist is in place in

90
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:08,530
about 20% of American hospitals.
Some countries have implemented it

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,300
nationwide,
France,

92
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,400
the United Kingdom.
Um,

93
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,060
places like Ecuador are adopting it
nationwide.

94
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,740
But,
um,

95
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,400
uh,
but are people really using it in their

96
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,080
heart of hearts?
Are they in there?

97
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,290
Well,
in the surgery world we are adopting it.

98
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,110
Um,
but have we recognize the lesson that

99
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,830
maybe this is the way we ought to think
about that we ought to have literally

100
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:37,600
pick up a checklist when you come in
with a new problem,

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
um,
that we're not there with.

102
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,580
Every time we get on an airplane,
someone picks up a checklist.

103
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,680
Well,
there are,

104
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,080
um,
there's a cultural obstacle.

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,590
We see checklists as a weakness,
as individual practitioners.

106
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,970
Um,
you know,

107
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,710
if you were in seeing a surgeon and they
said,

108
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,100
hmm,
I better check a textbook on this or I

109
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,930
want to check my checklist,
uh,

110
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,710
we,
we,

111
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,260
we're not there yet.
Culturally we're starting to be,

112
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,170
the second obstacle is,
um,

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,980
any old checklist is not the story here.
I mean we could end up just creating a

114
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,390
bunch of paperwork and tick boxes that,
that just get ignored and aren't really

115
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:22,391
valuable.
So the institutional obstacle is we have

116
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,250
to recognize this as a science in the
aviation world.

117
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,940
We have a national transportation safety
board that goes in and investigates

118
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:33,560
accidents and shows the lessons that a
Boeing or an Airbus then can adopt into

119
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,440
checklists and making the lessons
usable.

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,220
We need the same thing or kind of
Medical Safety Board and National

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,470
Institute for Health Systems Innovation
is what I would call it,

122
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,040
that would recognize for being
discharged to go home from a hospital.

123
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,950
There are six key components to a
checklist that every hospital should

124
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:01,490
have that we know make a difference in
reducing the likelihood that you're

125
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:06,491
going to bounce back into the hospital.
We print two inch that guidelines saying

126
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,050
what you should do for cardiac care,
but we haven't boiled it down to,

127
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,840
here are the six things.
One should never forget when you're in

128
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:17,330
there with that patient complaining of
chest pain.

129
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,720
Okay.
