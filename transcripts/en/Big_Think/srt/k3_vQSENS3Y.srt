1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,630
I think the pleasure,
funnily enough of the greatest pleasure

2
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:13,600
of writing comes from the response you
get from the readers.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,270
Here I am in New York.
You walk down the street,

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,230
people stop and talk to you and say how
much they love the book and the sort of

5
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,600
praise and uh,
there's been coming in for the,

6
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:26,680
for the latest book is very touching,
so it's damned hard work.

7
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,360
Of course,
I meant let's get ourselves,

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,261
you,
you,

9
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,510
it's,
it's not an easy job being a writer,

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,660
but once it's finished and you've done
it and it's published and it's in the

11
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:37,300
shops and if you're lucky,
it goes on the best seller's list.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,720
That's very exciting indeed.

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,250
I don't find that a struggle because I
spent a year

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,530
before I sit down to write on the first
day and then I go away and have a very

15
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:53,710
disciplined routine.
I rise at five in the morning and I

16
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:58,030
start work at six.
I work from six until eight from 10

17
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:02,740
until 12 from two until four from six
until eight.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,210
I've got to bed about nine 30 10 having
a light supper and then I'll get up

19
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:10,480
again at five the next morning.
And there's 50 days of that is the

20
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:14,350
beginning of what you call the struggle
and that it's tough work.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,330
And that's probably three or 400 hours.
And then I take a break and then I will

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,300
go back to it.
And the last draft of a prisoner of

23
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,360
birth,
my latest book was probably the 16th or

24
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,370
17th drops before anybody read it.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,720
Great processors.
Not

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,880
easy to describe because it's a bit like
if you're a violinist or if you're a

27
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,540
painter.
I'm a storyteller.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,200
So this is happening all the time.
My mind is buzzing off in different

29
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:49,160
directions all the time.
But I don't sit down and write a book

30
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,330
until I've had a year of thinking about
an idea and taking it through.

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,780
So the idea in a prisoner of birth is
the story of a young man born in the

32
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,310
east end of London,
the poor part of London,

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,020
who takes his girlfriend to the west end
to ask her to marry him,

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,750
and he gets involved in a fight,
nothing to do with him,

35
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,140
and he's arrested for murder and he then
you see the trial and he's condemned for

36
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,510
murder and sent to a prison from where
no one has escaped.

37
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,980
But he does escape.
He gets out and he seeks revenge on the

38
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,860
four people who put him there in the
first place.

39
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,550
Of course,
I see it clearly as an updating of the

40
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:33,551
count of Monte Cristo and the genius of
Dumas's book was the way the prisoner

41
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,610
got out and the way he raised the money
or add the money to gain revenge on the

42
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:43,850
four people.
So even before I sat down to write,

43
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,230
I made the decision,
I must know how Danny can't rate gets

44
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,800
out of prison.
I must know how Danny can't rate gets

45
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:55,160
the money that will make it possible for
him to succeed.

46
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,623
Trust.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,680
I've had problems where I've got to a
point and I can't see a way out of it,

48
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,800
but I've never,
I've never actually sat down and

49
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,161
thought,
oh,

50
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,710
I don't know what to do next.
And they were never,

51
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,070
well,
on that particular occasion,

52
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,320
it arose in a book I wrote called as the
crow flies where I had an Australian.

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,540
I'd had to have a man flight to
Australia to solve the mystery of how he

54
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,390
would inherit the fortune.
And when he got there,

55
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:34,650
the person who was going to solve it had
died a few weeks before he arrived.

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,950
That was suddenly thrown on me when I
went to bed that night,

57
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,800
and I didn't have the answer when I woke
the next morning.

58
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,970
So I walked around a golf course for
three days on and on and on until

59
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,180
suddenly in a split second,
it broke.

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,770
And it was so simple as all good ideas
are that got me off the hook.
