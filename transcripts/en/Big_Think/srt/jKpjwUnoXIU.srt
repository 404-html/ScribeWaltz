1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Short is more difficult and I think we
have to be recognized.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,150
Uh,
we're in for a,

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,680
a long,
difficult,

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,510
a top problem.
Uh,

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,570
things have not even reached the bottom.
One of the problems that we face is not

6
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,660
only if we lost confidence in our
financial institutions,

7
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:42,580
we've lost confidence in votes who are
supposed to be managing our economy.

8
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,030
Uh,
I can tell you for a fact,

9
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:47,860
you know,
they were going around your friends

10
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,380
things,
a g eight,

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,690
seven meetings and saying last May
saying we've turned the corner,

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,320
you know,
things are turning up.

13
00:00:56,321 --> 00:01:00,430
Things are going well.
I'm clearly,

14
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,850
uh,
they were either doing a sales job or

15
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,640
they didn't understand,
but in either case,

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,760
why should anybody listen to these guys
again,

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,200
they've been so consistently wrong.
So,

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,570
uh,
the,

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,700
the,
um,

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,950
there is this crisis of confidence,
um,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,290
the problems we're going to get worse.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,380
Uh,
we're only about halfway through the

23
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:31,381
fall and the housing prices,
housing prices go down more,

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,620
more,
more foreclosures will occur halfway

25
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:38,860
through,
assuming we don't overshoot that is to

26
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:41,890
say when you have a bubble,
when the bubble breaks,

27
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,620
you don't typically go back to the
normal level.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,900
You go further down and then you bounce
back up.

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,260
So things may be even worse than what I
just suggested.

30
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,730
If there is overshooting.
Secondly,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,780
states and localities are facing serious
problems.

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,800
Revenues are plummeting here in New York
City.

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,940
New York state depends very heavily on
revenues from the financial sector.

34
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,500
It's plummeting,
uh,

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,810
but states and localities depends have,
I wouldn't call it a balanced budget

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,450
framework.
When revenues go down,

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,720
they have to cut back expenditures.
And as they cut back expenditures,

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,900
the economy goes further down.
AIESEC several months ago that the first

39
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:30,991
agenda in stimulus ought to be to make
up for the shortfall in this state and

40
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,040
local revenues.

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,330
Because if you don't,
you're going to have a downward pressure

42
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,510
on the economy,
cut back of services to the poor,

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,670
a cutback of investments that would be
the basis of longterm economic growth.

44
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,900
But the Bush administration decided to
give a tax cut.

45
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:53,140
They think the tax cut a is a solution
to every problem.

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,760
The tax cuts were part of the problem.
The problem of America is not that we

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,510
consume too little with the savings rate
of zero.

48
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,290
How could anybody say that?
Yet that was the solution that the Bush

49
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,870
administration put forward.
So,

50
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,190
um,
uh,

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,620
the future cutbacks in state and local
expenditures are going to depress the

52
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,850
economy,
uh,

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,270
as the banking sector faces problems,
they're going to be more reluctant to

54
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,520
lend.
And as people see their houses price go

55
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,900
down,
they're going to be more reluctant to

56
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,350
borrow.
Uh,

57
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,850
the lack of transparency means that even
banks won't lend to each other.

58
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,000
So if there's a bank with money,
it's not going to be willing to lend to

59
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:38,320
a bank with the problem because it
doesn't know what the risk that it faces

60
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,060
are.
So,

61
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,100
uh,
I think we're good.

62
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,550
Mike say it only in the first half of
this game,

63
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,630
and,
uh,

64
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,250
I,
I would expect that the problems to

65
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,370
continue to unfold,
I think we're in a very difficult

66
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,710
position because the,
uh,

67
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,830
people that we turn to
traditionally have been the financial

68
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:07,030
markets and there are two reasons not to
trust them at this point.

69
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,150
First,
they've shown an enormous in competence.

70
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,720
Why should we trust these people who got
us into the mess to get us out of it?

71
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,690
Their judgments,
their understanding of the economy is

72
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,250
very,
very limited.

73
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,360
They understand how to make money in
good times,

74
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,650
how to protect themselves at the expense
of their investors.

75
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,970
They understand that,
but we're talking about a systemic and

76
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,630
economic why phenomena and they've
clearly demonstrated a lack of

77
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,550
competence in that area.
And secondly,

78
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,790
they have a vested interest.
Um,

79
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,930
you know,
they,

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,470
they want to protect their own future
and they're willing to let the economy

81
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,490
go down.
Um,

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,100
you know,
repeatedly a secretary treasurer try to

83
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,960
get Wall Street to come together and
say,

84
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,400
look,
it looks help Lehmann brothers.

85
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,234
They said,
no,

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,630
we'd rather see the economy go down.
Then to put our balance sheet at risk,

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,990
so their interests are clearly
divergent.

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Take Fatty Mac and Fannie Mae.
When we did the first bailout didn't

89
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,850
work.
When did the first bail out?

90
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,090
Right after that they found Fannie Mae a
issue,

91
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:20,650
a dividend payment,
putting the taxpayer even more at risk.

92
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,110
They were taking money out as the
government was saying,

93
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,320
we'll put money in.
I mean,

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,940
it's unconscionable.
So there's a clear divergence of

95
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,470
interest so we can't turn to them.

96
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,050
We can't turn to political leaders that
are dependent on money from the

97
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:42,781
lobbyists from Wall Street,
which is particularly true with the

98
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,590
Republican Party in,
in this coming election.

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,400
So I think on unfortunately,
that I think we have to turn to

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,270
academics,
people who've studied the matter that

101
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,400
have a,
don't have a vested interest other than

102
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,600
the best interest of making sure our
economy functions well and our jobs are

103
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,100
protected.
Uh,

104
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,861
you know,
and,

105
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:07,220
and our families,
our houses don't go down,

106
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,130
but it's that broader national interest
that I think,

107
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,070
uh,
we really have to be protecting.

108
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,740
And I don't think we can turn to one
street to get the answer.
