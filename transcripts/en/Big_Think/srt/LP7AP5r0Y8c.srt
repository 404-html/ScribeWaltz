1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,060
Real concern,
a few things came together.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,180
One is that I spent a lot of time
looking at the environmental trends and

3
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,060
conditions.
This is something that you can do in an

4
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,430
academic environment.
You have time to reflect,

5
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:27,431
and I've been in this field since 1970
and I thought I'd look back and see how

6
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:32,570
we were doing and what I found was that
we're really a,

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,230
despite his growing strengthen
environmental community,

8
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:39,320
the growing sophistication,
the growing number of groups here,

9
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:44,321
we find ourselves 40 years later on the
verge of losing the planet,

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,510
uh,
have really ruining this place for our

11
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:52,070
children and grandchildren,
but the data point in the wrong

12
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:54,500
directions.
So that was one thing.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,530
The other conclusion that I came to,
part of that really is that the way

14
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:05,021
we're going about environmentalism in
our country today is not going to

15
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,990
suffice.
We could double the efforts of the types

16
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,970
of things that we do now in mainstream
environmental racism.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,490
And it would improve things marginally,
but it would not carry the day would not

18
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,540
win where we need to win.
