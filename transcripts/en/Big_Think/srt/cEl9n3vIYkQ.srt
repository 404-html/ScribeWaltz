1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,070
From a personal standpoint,
I like to think that I'm,

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,360
that I am making a contribution and
however big or however small it is,

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,710
what are,
what I'm trying to do is to help solve

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,010
major social problems.
That's what I want to do.

5
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:26,810
That's sort of my life's work,
if you will.

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,960
And I've worked very hard at this.
I've,

7
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:33,440
I've done it now for a long,
long time and I've worked on everything

8
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:38,441
from seat belt safety to a third world
development to the things that we do at

9
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:42,050
arp.
And I'm a couple of examples of

10
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,580
successes,
not me personally,

11
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,390
but that,
uh,

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,290
we've been able to have it.
ARP is that we get prescription drugs

13
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:52,700
into Medicare and you cannot practice
modern medicine without prescription

14
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,490
drugs.
So long term that's going to have a huge

15
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,160
payoff for our country and for our older
citizens.

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,310
Um,
a few years ago we fought the good fight

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,840
and we were able to prevent social
security from being privatized.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,560
That for us was a big win and I think a
big win for the country.

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,190
So I'm,
I like to look at these a,

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,670
and there are plenty of,
of losses as well as wins.

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,880
Uh,
I'd like to look at these as steps

22
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,550
forward and hope that I made a
contribution to

23
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,210
the baby boomers have a huge
contribution.

24
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:30,560
In fact,
I wrote a book about it.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,100
It's called 50 plus igniting a
revolution to reinvent America.

26
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,360
And what 50 plus is about is the fact
that the boomers have so much more to

27
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,060
contribute.
Uh,

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,100
they're going to leave a legacy.
They are,

29
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:49,280
they're making change.
Now in terms of working longer in terms

30
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:50,114
of,
uh,

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,030
you know,
what's happening in the marketplace.

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,290
Uh,
some of the other issues I talked about

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,170
in terms of healthcare and so forth,
the boomers,

34
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,420
uh,
have been catered to their whole lives.

35
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:02,810
They've reinvented every aspect of life.
They've gone through a,

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,360
they're going to reinvent retirement,
uh,

37
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:06,350
and they've got an attitude.

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,033
Okay.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Well,
the biggest I think is a lack of

40
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,390
political will that we talked about
before.

41
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,840
Trying to get the,
uh,

42
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:23,240
the policy changes we need to prepare
for an aging society.

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,450
Uh,
it's very difficult right now to see how

44
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:31,451
we can break that partisan gridlock that
we face in Washington and in many state

45
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,150
capitals.
Um,

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,270
and,
and part of it has to be that the public

47
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,790
has to demand change.
Uh,

48
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,870
so that's one of the things that is a
very tough for us to deal with,

49
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,420
but there are others as well.
For example,

50
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,640
um,
a lot of people are in this country

51
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,730
because they haven't been able to save
for retirement for whatever reason,

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,910
are going to be really dependent upon
social security.

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,460
And social security was not ever meant
to be an entire source of retirement

54
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,610
living.
It was meant to be a kind of a safety

55
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,510
net kind of a floor.
And so I'm helping people who need a

56
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,670
helping hand,
helping older people,

57
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,250
uh,
who are not going to be well off as many

58
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,770
boomers are,
is a key part of what we have to think

59
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,604
about.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,020
Okay.
