1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,560
Oh,

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,200
well you're not really friends and
what's unusual is that I've even

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,420
operated on some friends and it's
changed our relationship because they've

4
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:21,910
gone from being friends to being friends
had operated on and,

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,310
and,
and I almost named their doctor now more

6
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:26,350
than their friend.
Um,

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,810
and it's different.
Uh,

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,320
you,
my father operated on folks in town and

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,130
had an interesting perspective on this
is because we're from a small town.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,670
He usually new people he was operating
on any often found it odd to not know a

11
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:50,050
person who was operating on he.
He liked it better when you knew because

12
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,320
you felt more invested even though he
had complications and things go wrong

13
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,860
like anybody else.
Whereas in a big city practice,

14
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm in Boston,
you know,

15
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,614
I,
I,

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,440
I always end up thinking twice,
you know,

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,550
one of my colleagues operated on his
girlfriend's a boyfriend.

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,021
I mean,
sorry,

19
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:12,230
his daughter's boyfriend and it was a,
uh,

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,020
you know,
we all kind of scratch your head as you

21
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:14,854
said,
well,

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,260
you know who,
who better to take a look at this guy.

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,070
Um,
so I think the,

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,670
um,
there is a necessary though,

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,640
professional line where,
um,

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,080
people are relying on you to be
something more than a friend.

27
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:36,420
They're relying on you to be a
professional and to,

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,510
by being a professional,
that means I'm really thinking through

29
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:43,930
how to do things optimally for them,
give them their best chance,

30
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:48,931
worked with other people as a team.
And that goes beyond what friendship

31
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,350
requires.
Um,

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,243
it's just different.

33
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,930
Well,
in some ways it deepens it because you

34
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,260
understand their issues.
I'm a cancer surgeon,

35
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,790
most of my,
I mean I do general surgery,

36
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,791
but most of the patients I take care of
our cancer patients and I'm a.

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,670
and it changes it in the sense that,
um,

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,970
well let me put this way,
for example.

39
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,670
Uh,
I mean I haven't ever operated on

40
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,430
someone who's really my best friend and
I'm not sure I would do that,

41
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,290
but,
but folks who are friends,

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,630
colleagues from work,
for example,

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,620
who are the same age as me,
and uh,

44
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,270
we find,
for example,

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,910
that they're not sure what to call me
anymore.

46
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,210
They always called me a tool before and
then they almost want to call me Dr

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,900
Gawande because they see me that way.
Um,

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,741
and I would say to him,
no,

49
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:43,981
no,
no,

50
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:48,120
call me a tool.
And it is that,

51
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,180
that discomfort.
You see them deciding,

52
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,410
well,
I won't call them anything.

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,680
I'll just say hi,
I'm the friendship can become both

54
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:02,560
deeper and yet a little more formal.
We ended up talking about,

55
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,170
you know,
life and death and their fears will,

56
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,430
this cancer comeback is often very high
in their minds.

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,040
Um,
makes it hard to just talk about,

58
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,150
you know,
boy,

59
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,550
that movie Avatar was not that good was
it?

60
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,420
I don't think gratitudes right,
the right word.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
Um,
you know,

62
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,770
the,
we're getting so good at doing what we

63
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,440
do in medicine.
I'm not good enough.

64
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,500
Uh,
but when it goes well,

65
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,020
there's enormous relief,
but there's an expectation that,

66
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,460
you know,
that's the way it should have gone.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,940
Instead,
I think what they feel like is there's

68
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,050
this person here who is the source of
information for me who can tell me

69
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:45,020
something about what's going on that I
don't really understand.

70
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,240
And so when we run into each other,
you know,

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,780
on the one hand we might be sharing cd
recommendations,

72
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,340
but you know,
inevitably they can't get out of the

73
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:59,570
room and meeting up without wanting to
just take you aside and say,

74
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,411
Hey,
you know,

75
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:04,130
I've been having this going on or that
going on and is there anything I should

76
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:09,131
be worried about?
And that discussion is very different in

77
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:10,341
some ways.
You know,

78
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:11,990
I want to be able to escape it,
you know,

79
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:14,840
let's just have a regular old
friendship.

80
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,960
But in other ways it is special.
I had,

81
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,840
I liked that connection,
being able to be helpful.
