1
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,750
I don't have a horrible

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,290
cartoon.
I want to make the people standing in

3
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:18,610
line
at Saint Peter's gate.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,300
They go to heaven and you know,
there's the rich men in the,

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,410
the poor widows and,
and Saint Peter's asking them,

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,550
how much money did you make and that,
and then the poor people are going to

7
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:32,210
hell say,
that's my horrible cartoon.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,580
You know?
And that's like,

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,740
should not be the measure of a good
life.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,930
Um,
my,

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,450
I think it's,
I think it's being true to your,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,300
uh,
I,

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,560
I really think being true to your,
uh,

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,990
family and friends to whatever world
you've created around yourself,

15
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:48,370
the real world,
what,

16
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,960
who are the people you care about?
Um,

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,430
it's not,
I don't think,

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,590
uh,
I think you can try to make the world a

19
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,530
better place,
but I think too many people I feel doing

20
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,550
that become,
you know,

21
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:04,990
Mrs Jelly beans and they just,
they throw themselves into that and your

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,750
screw over the people who are actually
around them.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,050
Um,
I think causes are,

24
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,660
uh,
are nice,

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,500
but the,
your greatest cause needs to be your

26
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,580
immediate circle.

27
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,770
Okay.
