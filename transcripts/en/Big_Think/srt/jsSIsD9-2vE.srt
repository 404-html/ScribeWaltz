1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,050
Vaccines,
um,

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,430
have a variety of guises.
So some of the Audi vaccines,

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,790
well known as attenuated vaccines,
that's is the infectious organism had

4
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:27,830
been changed such it could still
replicate and even body but not cause

5
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:31,370
disease.
And this is what happened with the first

6
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,560
vaccine.
Um,

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,080
I couldn't fight by Jenna using cow pox
as a means of preventing smallpox and a

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,540
cow pox,
uh,

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,130
had sufficient similarity to smallpox.
It could elicit,

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,190
induce an immune response,
which was protective against smallpox.

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,620
So that was a whole,
uh,

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,690
live virus which was used to prevent
smallpox later on,

13
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,750
people using what's known as killed
vaccines.

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,110
So influencer is a good example where
influenza is grown up in eggs or tissue

15
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:12,980
culture.
It's then killed and then administered

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,060
as a killed virus to the individual via
hypodermic needle.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,550
And those proteins are seen as being
foreign by the immune system.

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,120
They are an infectious disease.
They don't belong to the body and

19
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:31,121
therefore an immune responses mounted.
More recently people have been able to

20
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,660
identify specific proteins from an
infectious organism.

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,610
A Nice example is the hepatitis B
vaccine where the surface protein,

22
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,180
a isolated from the virus via genetic
engineering and just that single protein

23
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,810
is grown up purified and then used as a
vaccine and just the immune response to

24
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:58,940
that single protein is able to prevent
the individual from becoming infected by

25
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:02,150
the virus.
So there's numbers of ways that one can

26
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:07,151
generate a vaccine,
tremendous amount of change over the

27
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:13,411
last 20 years.
Part of this has been enabled by the,

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,150
uh,
molecular biology revolution coming out

29
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:21,100
of the seventies and eighties,
which allowed us to clone and express

30
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:23,710
proteins from various infectious
diseases,

31
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,720
uh,
particularly viruses,

32
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,460
bacteria,
fungi.

33
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,040
And being able to work with those
proteins has enabled us to get a better

34
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,310
understanding as to how those infectious
organisms,

35
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,890
uh,
infect individuals,

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,020
how they evade the immune system.

37
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,890
And specifically it's allowed us to find
Achilles heels for the various bugs,

38
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,870
whether it'd be for antibiotics,
targeting various proteins and bacteria

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,140
to prevent them from replicating or
antiviral trucks where we can inhibit a

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,080
viral to prevent the virus from
replicating in a human cell.

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,670
The genetics have been very important
for us to understand how to make better

42
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,120
vaccines against some of these
infectious organisms.

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,350
And really just studying these,
uh,

44
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,520
bugs,
uh,

45
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,540
at a very detailed level and their
interaction with the immune system helps

46
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:24,931
us understand how we could perhaps help
the immune system do a better job at

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,350
preventing infection.
So generating vaccines that don't

48
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,080
utilize the whole,
uh,

49
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,090
infectious organism,
just using parts of it,

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,760
uh,
and by generating what we would call a

51
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:41,440
neutralizing immune response,
whether it be antibodies which bind

52
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,490
specifically to,
uh,

53
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,690
proteins on the bug and effectively take
it out of circulation and prevent the

54
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:54,421
person from being infected.
The science around infectious diseases

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,210
has been really quite key to our
understanding,

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,510
uh,
and give us some really key insights

57
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,680
into,
uh,

58
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,480
the immune system.
And based on our increased understanding

59
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,780
of the immune system over the last 20
odd years has enabled us to discern how

60
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,090
we could perhaps,
um,

61
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,450
use the immune system to manage disease
in a way that people probably hadn't

62
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,130
thought about.
Um,

63
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,420
only a few years ago.

64
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,980
Being so interested in vaccines and
seeing how much,

65
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,120
uh,
you know,

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,890
potential they hold for us.
I think we have to see Jenna who

67
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,980
effectively invented vaccination as
being,

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,930
uh,
a tremendous,

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,390
uh,
um,

70
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,610
stalwart and inventor in the area.
So he probably is my number one public

71
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:54,060
health hero,
but then we have to go to people like

72
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,540
saul can,
saving who invented the polio vaccines,

73
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,500
and,
uh,

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,650
you can go on and on,
but I think it's probably because the

75
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:06,420
vaccines have had such a major impact in
improving public health throughout the

76
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:07,750
whole world.
Uh,

77
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,160
that one has to look to the
vaccinologist as,

78
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,000
uh,
being public health heroes.

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:17,810
Yeah.
