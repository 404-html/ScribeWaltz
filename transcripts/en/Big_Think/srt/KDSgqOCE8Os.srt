1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,600
So the prefrontal cortex is guiding the
process,

2
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:09,580
but I think there's one,
while we are discussing screens,

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,210
metaphoric screens in different spaces
where where the show is going on or

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,220
auditory and tactile and so on.
I think what is interesting is to think

5
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:26,221
that those spaces,
those performance spaces are separate.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,920
They're extremely sophisticated.
They tend to be in terms of brain

7
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:34,300
structure,
very,

8
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,740
very modern in evolution.
They tend to have some of the most

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,010
sophisticated circuitry.
But take for example,

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,710
the visual system.
Our judicial system is an amazing

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,130
instrument and of course the visual
system that allows us to perceive right

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,550
now something with the fine perception
that I got,

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,780
I can have over the depth of the color
and your sweater and so on.

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,410
Uh,
all of that is extremely sophisticated,

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,600
but then surrounding that,
let's,

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,810
let's consider that like an island and
then surrounding that there's an ocean

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,790
and that ocean is filled with knowledge
of how different parts,

18
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,790
different components of past perceptions
have been put together in time when they

19
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:28,390
were occurring.
And so I think that that's an

20
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:33,391
interesting analogy is the analogy of
strings that pull the puppets are in the

21
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:39,751
performance spaces and so it's not that
we should privilege the performance

22
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:44,200
spaces as the thing that matters,
of course that matters very much because

23
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:49,201
that's where our consciousness,
our consciousness is actually occurring

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,420
quote unquote,
but it's occurring.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,480
They're only by the grace of this trains
that are being pulled from the other

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,760
space this elsewhere where you have what
I like to call convergence divergence,

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,480
which are end of themselves.

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,350
I just want to say,
just pause for a second because this

29
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,650
convergence divergence,
um,

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,070
this is,
um,

31
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,930
what you're,
you're making a broader category for

32
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,780
parts of the brain that,
that I recognize,

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,990
but you are putting it together in a
larger context as I understand,

34
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,310
after reading your book yesterday.

35
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,290
Good.
Okay.

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,280
Just,
just to.

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,340
I just wanted to give that info.
Your spirit has tremendously anyway,

38
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,220
but.
So yeah,

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,300
that's a very interesting because from a
neutral standpoint,

40
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,450
uh,
you could even say that these structures

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,460
are in of themselves rather dumb.
It's not that they know anything

42
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:00,790
consciously.
What they know is that they have a sort

43
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:05,650
of internal testimony of the
simultaneous occurrence,

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,700
occurrence of certain things at a
certain point.

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,610
So for example,
if I will,

46
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,560
uh,
tomorrow remember talking to you today,

47
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,910
uh,
I will think of a certain words that you

48
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,160
have said,
pretty simple the sentence you just said

49
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,940
about the book,
which I probably will remember,

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,240
uh,
in some form and I will remember the

51
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:38,740
fact that you have this sweater that I
presume is spink,

52
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,740
although I'm not very good with colored
pink.

53
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,730
Okay?
Yes.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,620
Okay.
And the pink and the white shirt and

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,720
your beautiful blonde hair.

56
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,110
Uh,
so how do I put this thing together?

57
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,890
This is occurring right now and I am
recording the simultaneity of occurrence

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,280
of Your Voice,
of certain ideas and certain

59
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,920
requirements,
but they are in different places.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,220
So we need to find in the brain a place
where signals about all these different

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,880
things can come together in,
can make a record of the,

62
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,320
the,
the,

63
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,320
the proximity and simultaneity of this
in time.

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,930
Yes.
Temporality.

65
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:29,381
We'll,
we'll,

66
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:32,710
we'll go there next.
And once that happens,

67
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:37,711
once that record is made,
then it is possible to reactivate the

68
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:43,261
record and to come back into the same
regions where this is happening to us

69
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,340
right now,
and reconstruct something that he's

70
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,460
going to be a paler version of the
original,

71
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,110
but it's going to relate to the
original.

72
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,250
And that,
by the way,

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
gets us into one very important issue,
which is the issue that you don't have

74
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,870
a,
a facsimile memory of.

75
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
It's important.
Yeah.

76
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,010
I don't,
I don't have a memory.

77
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,470
I'm not going to have a polaroid
picture.

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,160
You right now talking to me.
No soundtrack.

79
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,860
What I'm going to have is all these bits
and pieces of information with which I

80
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:25,360
will be allowed to reconstruct something
of this moment.

81
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,810
But of course the reconstruction is not
going to be entirely accurate.

82
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,470
And who knows,
maybe that in time I may even make a

83
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:37,471
confusion and I could be asked the court
to say what you're wearing.

84
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,440
And I could say that you were wearing a
blue eye.

85
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,170
And I think this is,
this is quite

86
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,003
important,
um,

87
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,090
that the fact that our brains and our
memories are not like recording devices

88
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,590
like film,
um,

89
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,060
and that,
that is how we,

90
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,410
some significant errors and those errors
also can be created by an emotion

91
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,200
attached to the experience so that you
can even entirely invert a memory

92
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,010
depending on the motivation in some way.
And I don't mean conscious motivation,

93
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:20,861
but they deeply embodied a drive or push
sometimes that can have an emotional

94
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:26,360
valence that will change memory.
Yes.

95
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,520
People,
you know,

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,750
the,
the testimonies in court very often

97
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,760
affected.
Yes.

98
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,950
Yeah.
You have all sorts of misattribution

99
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:38,190
errors in versions of time sequence and
so on.

100
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:41,520
And that's because we don't have a
filmic medium.

101
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:46,521
We don't have cellulite with an optic
soundtrack attached to it.

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,560
What we have is this incredibly
sophisticated mechanism of transforming

103
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
is,
it's almost like coding.

104
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,640
You have this little bits and pieces
that are occurring in time and then you

105
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:03,540
have the possibility of reconstruction
or react reactivation,

106
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,280
which is very,
very,

107
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,240
very,
very intriguing.

108
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,950
And by the way,
it's extremely economic.

109
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,641
You know,
the,

110
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,600
the,
the brain.

111
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,640
Whenever it can,
um,

112
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,790
does things,
I'm facilely and a leisurely and you

113
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,060
know,
if,

114
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,770
if there's no need to repeat and
reinvent the wheel,

115
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,150
well this is,
this is very important for,

116
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,450
um,
perception because perception,

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,600
the way we perceive things has to do
with deep learning in the brain.

118
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,690
And uh,
one of my favorite philosophers who,

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,150
you mentioned a footnote in your most
recent book,

120
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,630
Molly's mellow,
pointy,

121
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,970
talks about perception of something he
calls stereotypes.

122
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,530
And in neuroscience there's a similar
idea,

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,560
which is that the brain also will take
in information according to its own

124
00:07:58,891 --> 00:07:59,724
expectations.

125
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,950
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

126
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,910
Yeah.
Because we don't,

127
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,720
you know,
it's not just that we have memory of the

128
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:09,410
things that we have been living through
since we were born.

129
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,650
We have past memories that we have
inherited a through a whole history of

130
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:20,420
evolution before us.
That in fact I have memories of things

131
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,150
that our fore runners have been doing
it.

132
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:25,760
I'm not just talking about the human
four runners,

133
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,220
four runners that go all the way into
reptiles and single cells,

134
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,670
you know,
things that have been done in a certain

135
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:38,240
way in life,
in life forms,

136
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,430
in that course,
of course,

137
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:43,400
been memorized by the biological
systems.

138
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:43,560
We.
