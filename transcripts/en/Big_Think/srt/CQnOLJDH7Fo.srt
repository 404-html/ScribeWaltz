1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,470
The
system.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,410
It's under strain.
And we're seeing manifestation of that

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:15,530
is and the rise of the independent voter
registration.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,990
I think the political system,
if you look at here in Washington from

5
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,880
the governing standpoint,
it's clearly broken.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,030
We're at gridlock on every issue.
We fail to address issues of

7
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:32,900
irresponsible spending or Medicare,
social security,

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,260
and we don't do any of the hard things.
Um,

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,290
we spend,
we're in a continuous battle over the

10
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,540
war in Iraq and,
uh,

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,580
partisanship and bitterness is probably
as high level as I've seen it in all my

12
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:51,581
years here,
that we sit down together for the good

13
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,850
of the country.
I know how to work across cio with

14
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,460
Democrats.
So I have for many years as president,

15
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:03,180
I will reach across my hand,
across the aisle to the Democrats,

16
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:07,610
and I'll ask them to reach across to me
and I'll ask the American people to urge

17
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:10,660
him to do so.
If we get things accomplished,

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,880
then obvious him all the credit.
