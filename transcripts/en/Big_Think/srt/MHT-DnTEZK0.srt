1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,890
I am very good at hiring because I've
made a lot of mistakes.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,540
I learned to look at the specific
individual and look for the most

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,910
important traits in them and ignore
everything else,

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,090
especially the resume.
Send you in the wrong direction.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,290
I learned through trial and error what
makes a great manager,

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,870
what makes a great salesperson,
and that's who I always are.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,800
If you're going to hire a lot of
salespeople for your organization,

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,870
I found that I looked for the same three
things in every single person I hired.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,890
I wanted someone who was insecure with
something,

10
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:38,690
approve.
If somebody walks in,

11
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,730
they're cocky.
They never become.

12
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:45,080
Your great salespeople.
Might top 10 salespeople making millions

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,930
of dollars a year.
Every year came to my office in

14
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:49,010
December,
swearing.

15
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,110
They would never have another good year.
Why?

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,130
It was ridiculous,
but they were insecure enough to think

17
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,480
it could never happen again.

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,750
You want an insecure person.
If you're hiring a salesperson with

19
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:04,160
something to prove.
You also want someone who has a positive

20
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:07,220
attitude in every way because you know
what happens.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,510
A positive person when they get hit and
sales is all about getting hit and

22
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:14,600
knocked down,
they spend very little time feeling

23
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:17,540
sorry for themselves.
They get right back up that backout you

24
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,090
almost need a low Iq like hit me again,
hit me again,

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,300
hit me again.
That's a great salesperson and then you

26
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:27,470
need the work ethic to go with it.
Nobody is great and sale unless they

27
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:31,730
work like crazy.
So those are the three traits I look for

28
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:36,731
in every great salesperson.
What I look for in a manager is someone

29
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,350
who's going to be loyal.
I mean heck,

30
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:42,530
if I'm going to build a giant house,
which is my business on a shaky

31
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,970
foundation,
how far am I going to get?

32
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,840
I need a structure with a footing is
loyal as can be,

33
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,150
is going to stand there through the
thick and thin.

34
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,860
I also need someone who believes that
we're going to succeed.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,690
I need someone with a positive attitude,
always a positive attitude because you

36
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:03,300
know what I find,
I find a manager with a positive

37
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:07,140
attitude is always going to find a way
to get to where you want them to go.

38
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,940
A mark of a good manager is someone
who's organized.

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,540
I always ask everyone I'm interviewing
in an interview.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,410
On a scale of one to 10,
how would you rate yourself as an

41
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:22,820
organized person?
I never hire anyone who says nine or 10.

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,340
I want the guy who says,
oh,

43
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,950
I'm bad at 12.
A manager without follow through is

44
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:30,740
useless.
You gotta be able to give the command.

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,520
They get it done and they don't forget
about it when something distracts them.

46
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,590
A manager always follows through.
