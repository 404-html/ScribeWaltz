1
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,840
Sometimes the symptoms don't show up
right away.

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,090
Um,
and there's a kind of natural healing

3
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,660
that can go on just by leaving a war
zone.

4
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:23,290
And sometimes it's not good to talk to
people we think now right afterwards,

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,950
but rather to almost let the wound heal
a little bit on its own.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,490
Um,
but some of the symptoms were aware of

7
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,750
and you know,
uh,

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,130
and they will be,
um,

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,760
a hypervigilance being in a sense,
hyper sensory mode.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,840
So walking the perimeter are listening
with a cuteness the way you would in a

11
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,230
battle area.
Um,

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,400
or it might also be flashbacks.
Um,

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,720
inability to sleep or just one moment,
one of my soldiers to rob kiss low,

14
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:54,280
just found himself in a bar with his
arms around someone's neck.

15
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:56,200
He strangled this guy.
Um,

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,660
and then he,
and then he realized that he had heard

17
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:02,880
something and thought he was in fighter
mode and it just slipped into fighter

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,460
mode imperceptibly.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,180
Um,
and that was about a year,

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,840
you know,
after battle he was in,

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,000
he was,
uh,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,980
a long term patient at Walter Reed and
being treated by the way for physical

23
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:15,814
injuries,
um,

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,930
loss of arm use,
titanium armor placement in a and a leg

25
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,190
replacement.
Um,

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,220
other times it could also just be this
numbing that you,

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,620
you've,
you've had to,

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,960
um,
you're exposed to the sorts of stresses

29
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:32,680
that are so superhuman that you have to
protect yourself by numbing and you,

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,330
you continued to dissociate afterwards.
So those are some of the physical,

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,000
you know,
the physiological effects that we're

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,580
familiar with.
But what I'm trying to explore,

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,290
um,
are the,

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,570
the spectrum that doesn't necessarily,
um,

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,620
in,
in what may include some of these,

36
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,440
but also includes these con conflict
feelings,

37
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:58,060
get sexual feelings of feeling some
guilt for what you did or what you saw

38
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,020
and did your best,
but couldn't help to do even better than

39
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,520
you wished you could have done to
survive about all.

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,050
Um,
when your buddies does don't to be part

41
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,720
of an accident where yours no fault at
all,

42
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,280
no culpability,
but you,

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,650
um,
but,

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,150
but you were implicated,
causally implicated,

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,900
and you hold yourself really accountable
or to love your buddies more than you

46
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,420
love your spouse or your family.
And you know,

47
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,370
one of my soldiers said to me,
you know,

48
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,740
I'm in a tent with someone day in and
day out and I know,

49
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:32,890
and he passes wind at night.
I know that Fart,

50
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,923
you know,
and he said,

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,910
how can I tell my mother that I am?
Was that,

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,390
um,
physically close to someone so that the

53
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:43,390
feeling of betrayal almost of your home
family,

54
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:48,370
because you reattached to others who've
got you through it,

55
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,240
are also feeling that life has darren
boring at home when you've been so

56
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:54,430
wrapped up in revved,
revved up and hepped up,

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,460
that it's hard to want to,
hard to find the same kind of thrill and

58
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,140
adventure even though it's filled with
danger.
