1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,310
What really launched my serious research
into network effects on the economics of

2
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:13,890
network effects with some of the work
that I was doing in human capital and

3
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,680
the notion that innovation isn't just a
transaction.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,920
Innovation is an investment in the human
capital and capabilities and

5
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,740
competencies and creativity of your
customer's network.

6
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:30,741
Effects are basically how customers or
users create value for each other.

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,620
It's basically an external to the
individual user.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,180
So an example of a network effect would
be if you and I had a phone that would

9
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:46,020
be great for you and I,
but in network effect is the more people

10
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:50,310
who use phones,
the more valuable the phone network

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,030
becomes,
the more valuable each other become

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,920
because we can call more people and more
people can call us and heck,

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,770
they may even be the opportunity to do a
conference call,

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,690
which is another form of network effect.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,930
So network effects are basically a way
that the more people participate in

16
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,390
using a product or service,
the more valuable it becomes.

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,170
There's no such thing anymore as a non
networked organization.

18
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:18,721
Now,
admittedly,

19
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:23,280
some networks are better than others,
but we can absolutely make the case that

20
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,630
one of the fundamental transformations
over the last 50 years is the network

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,470
effication of large organizations and
small organizations,

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,510
not just in OACD countries,
but all over the world network

23
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:41,511
suffocation has taken over the world.
It's how do you get value from these

24
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,790
networks?
There's a wonderful line from the,

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,100
the first industrial sociologist,
a Frenchman by the name of Frederick Law

26
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:52,220
play.
He was the superintendent of a cold.

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,270
The minds and his phrase was the most
important product of the mine is the

28
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,770
minor.
It's not the coal,

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,420
it's not the metal,
it's not the 10 it's the human capital

30
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,180
that allows you to extract the value
from the mind.

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,750
So that's update this to the 21st
century.

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,180
The most important product of the
network is the networker,

33
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,100
not the bits,
not the bites,

34
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,540
not the bandwidth,
not the data.

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,810
It's the people.
And in an Internet of things age,

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,220
the things,
the machines,

37
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:31,221
the devices on the network,
if we can make networkers more valuable,

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,280
we make our networks more valuable.
And that is indeed the recipe for an

39
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,660
Amazon,
for a google,

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,430
for a Yelp,
for a Linkedin,

41
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,500
for an at t,
and t for Netflix.

42
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,400
What does Google do to make customers
better?

43
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,040
It,
it gives them the ability to search and

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,010
iterate on those searches.
And what does Google do?

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,360
It converts those clicks into more
efficient search.

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,720
That's the essence of a web 2.0 network
effects company.

47
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,360
The same holds for the Amazon
recommendation engine or for Netflix.

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,920
So what you're doing is you're making it
in.

49
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,070
You're not just giving customers what
they want,

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,740
you're investing in improving their
capabilities.

51
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:19,741
What was another way that Google did
that Google gave you for free gmail

52
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,070
email,
which enables it to learn more about

53
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,640
your social network,
what you're interested in communicating

54
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,110
about,
et cetera.

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,680
Same thing with linkedin.
So the whole notion,

56
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,810
that's why linkedin bought a company
like Linda.

57
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,890
So not just to improve people's resume,
but to improve people's skills.

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,280
So the,
the notion of a network effect here is

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,760
as we give our customers the ability to
do more for themselves,

60
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,970
they can do more with us and on our
network.

61
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,680
So in the early days of the telephone,
all you could do was talk to someone,

62
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,170
then you could do a facts,
then you could do a conference call.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,880
Then there were these things called
modems that allowed you to send email.

64
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,720
You are increasing the capability of the
customer,

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,660
allowed you to get more value from the
network.

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,360
And indeed customers want it to do so
much.

67
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:21,361
You had to do what you had to redesign
the architectures and the capabilities

68
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,520
of the network.
So you have an iterative network

69
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:29,521
development process here as customer
capabilities and capacities increase,

70
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,140
you have to change the capabilities and
capacities of the network and vice

71
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,680
versa.
