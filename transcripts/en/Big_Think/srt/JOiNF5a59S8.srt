1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,513
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,830
I have teenage boys and I started
investing with them when they were 12

3
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:17,530
years old.
So ideally the best time is when they're

4
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:20,860
teenagers.
I'm a big believer that those people who

5
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:25,861
have been exposed to investing at an
early age are going to be much more

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,990
comfortable with the whole process as
adults.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,010
So ideally parents starch start teaching
their kids when they're teenagers,

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,200
you know,
open up a custodial brokerage account,

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,250
help them choose stocks and mutual funds
and let them be a part of the process.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,730
But that's not always the case because
what we found from our studies is that

11
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:46,480
so many adults are not equipped to make
sound financial decisions.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,060
Their parents didn't talk about it
there.

13
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:52,690
Um,
schools didn't teach them and so they're

14
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,280
not in a position to teach their own
kids.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,900
So the second best place to start
investing is when you become in the

16
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:00,700
workforce when you're 20,
you know,

17
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:05,701
22 years old and he worked for a
corporation that offers a 401k.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,200
In fact,
our studies show that that's really when

19
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:13,030
people begin to learn to invest,
but then it's up to the corporation to

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,200
provide financial education and literacy
and encourage their employees to take

21
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:20,140
advantage of this retirement vehicle

22
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,220
because young people have more time to
weather the ups and downs of the stock

23
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,980
market.
They're in a much better position to

24
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:38,870
take on more risk and you know with what
little more risk you get a little more

25
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:42,530
reward and that would be a reason to
take on more risk.

26
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,310
But again,
it really depends on your,

27
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,180
you know,
how much you can stomach it,

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,570
you know,
can you sleep at night when there are

29
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:53,180
bigger dips in the market?
Because if you do have a bigger

30
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:57,950
percentage of stocks in your portfolio
and we have a big downmarket that your

31
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,000
portfolio is going to react more so than
say if you had less stock and more

32
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,560
bonds.
But again,

33
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,090
over the long term history shows that if
you take on a little more risk,

34
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,970
you're going to get more return.
But keep in mind,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,350
there is a sweet spot where there,
if you take on a little bit too much

36
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,120
risk,
you're not going to get that much more

37
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,920
return.
So consider,

38
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,750
you know,
at the very least I'm saying,

39
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,700
I'm going to say for a young person in
their twenties,

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
I would say,
and again,

41
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,410
it's very personal,
um,

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
at least 80% in a diversified stock
portfolio for their retirement account

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,550
or for those accounts that they know
they're not going to touch and they're

44
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,280
going to build upon over the year,
save for the next 40 years.

45
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:44,510
Yeah.
