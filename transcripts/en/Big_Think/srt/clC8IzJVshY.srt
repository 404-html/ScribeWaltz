1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,520
We are the most self centered generation
in history,

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,910
not just the the generation that exists,
but the baby boom generation before it

3
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,570
was brought up in the me generation and
everything in society teaches.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,940
It's all about me.
Every commercial says,

5
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,580
it's all about you.
We do it all for you.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,190
Have it your way.
You deserve it.

7
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,370
I got to think of me first and we are
taught selfishness and that's why when I

8
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,270
wrote purpose driven life,
it's really a countercultural book

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,410
because the very first sentence is the
exact opposite of our culture.

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,860
It says it's not about you,
and that's almost like a slap in the

11
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:56,880
face.
No,

12
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,230
I'm sorry.
It's not about you.

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,320
There are a lot of things bigger in the
world that simply your own happiness,

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,100
your own fulfillment,
a your own little selfish.

15
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,400
Claude have a life as George Bernard
Bernard Shaw called it,

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,400
and uh,
the,

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,300
the,
the,

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,550
uh,
reasonably high divorces.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,770
People don't,
haven't been given good models.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,390
Their parents often.
We're a good model of unselfishness.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,890
Second,
I think it takes three to make a

22
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,230
marriage work.
I think it takes you,

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,990
I think it takes your spouse and I think
it takes God.

24
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:30,450
It's like a three.
You can't have a two legged stool,

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,640
will fall over.
One legged stool,

26
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,610
will fall over two legged stool,
but when you have you,

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,490
yourself and and your partner and God in
the thing,

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,010
it makes a triangle and as you're
growing closer to God and your spouse

29
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,740
was growing closer to God,
it automatically brings you together.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,500
My wife and I,
as I said,

31
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,520
are extremely different from each other
in practically every single way,

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,480
but as we grow closer to God,
we grow closer to each other and it is

33
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,560
the glue that has held us together.
When every bone in my body wanted to

34
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,330
give up on her body.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Now we actually made a commitment when
it was till death do us part,

36
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,890
and so we said,
we're going to lock this gay patch,

37
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,750
close it,
and throw away the key.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,210
Now,
in those first two years when it was

39
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,420
hell on earth,
I mean really at.

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,680
We started fighting on the,
on the honeymoon,

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,210
and we're going,
wait a minute.

42
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,960
I saved myself for this is like,
what a disappointment,

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,610
you know,
and,

44
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,421
and we,
you know,

45
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:32,130
we were fighting from the first day on
because we were immature and we didn't

46
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:37,131
know how to share and how adults learn.
But as you grow through life,

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,410
uh,
if you stay with a commitment,

48
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,270
it really will get better.
It's,

49
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,550
it's being willing to learn,
being willing to reconcile a work.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,230
Don't fix the blame fixtures.
