1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,870
Well,
Goldman recognize some of the problems

2
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:12,880
early on.
I can't say that you understood all that

3
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:16,120
was coming,
but certainly they repor recky dies the

4
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:21,100
subprime mortgage crisis early in 2007
long before,

5
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,050
uh,
the crunch 18 months before the big

6
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,620
crunch hit in the fall 2008.
So he had a lot of firms like ups,

7
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,610
a Swiss from continuing to invest
heavily in subprime mortgages and losing

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,430
tens of billions more.
I think Goldman lost about 70 million in

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:36,940
that crisis.
But then in August of 2007,

10
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:41,080
a very significant event took place that
I talk about in my book seven lessons.

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,620
And that's that uh,
three of the quantitative quantitative

12
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:47,710
funds,
Goldman has went way down 30 to 40% as

13
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:50,080
did all quant funds that day.
And it was,

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,940
this volatility was so extreme that the
management saw that there's something

15
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,300
odd going on in the markets and our
models don't predict what's going on.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,450
And as a result,
they pulled back and said,

17
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:05,740
we're going to start accumulating cash.
You could say hardy cash accumulating

18
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,170
cash.
And so they spent a full year

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,620
accumulating a lot of cash.
So they came into the crisis in

20
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:16,621
September,
2008 with over $120 billion in cash.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,750
If Layman had had another 20 billion,
they probably would have been saved,

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,820
but they didn't take those kind of
moves.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,580
And so yes,
there was a run on cash.

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,350
Yes,
there's liquidity crunch,

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,330
but they were willing to,
to uh,

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,460
they,
they had the capacity to stand in to

27
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:32,170
that.
And I think that's a good lesson for all

28
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,240
of us.
One of the things I talked about in my

29
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,980
book,
get ready for the long haul because if

30
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:38,290
you think things are bad today,
they're going to get worse,

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,930
not better.
And so you need to be ready for a long

32
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:44,380
haul problem and have the cash reserves
to pull you through it.

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,971
No,
I don't.

34
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:50,190
I think a,
a firm like Goldman,

35
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:53,550
it's human capital that matters and
that's why you have to be so sensitive.

36
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,790
The board spends an enormous amount of
time on the human capital getting to

37
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,520
know the people at all levels.
Who are the,

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,190
who are the rising stars,
who are the people coming up in the

39
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,570
system?
Uh,

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,480
I got a surprise as did the rest of the
board.

41
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,700
When Hank Paulson change his mind
decided,

42
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,680
said,
except president bushes offered to

43
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:15,630
become secretary of the treasury.
That was may of 2006 and thank goodness

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,510
we not only knew Lloyd,
but we knew all the other top people.

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,110
And we can make considered decisions not
just about the CEO,

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,200
but who the other structure where a Gary
Cohen or Jon winkelried,

47
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,590
he could step up and other people could
take on greater responsibility and

48
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,900
awaken hanks departure.
Had we not known these people,

49
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,370
we couldn't have done that.
Now we're asking,

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
you know,
who's going to be the next CFO?

51
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,480
Is gonna be the next chief personnel
officer?

52
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,850
It could be the next general counsel who
are all these people.

53
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:42,330
And so we have dinner with these people.
We get to see him live and in action.

54
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,430
They present to the board.
Very good system.

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,650
It could board doesn't do that.
You're in trouble.

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,980
But it is human capital.
It's not a tech.

57
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,510
You can,
you do the technology,

58
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,420
but everyone does the technology.
That's nothing unique about that.

59
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,530
The only thing unique is the human gap.

60
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,060
I like the word resilient because there
were going to have with the timeframe

61
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:10,640
compressed for technology change,
uh,

62
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,390
and operating in global markets,
they're going to be more crises.

63
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,560
This is hardly the last.
And so I think firms need to be

64
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,610
resilient and the system needs to be
resilient and waiting for secretary

65
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:24,580
geithner and Ben Bernanki to put in
some,

66
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,380
uh,
frankly some,

67
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,900
uh,
some complete policies including the

68
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,190
regulations and ensure the systems
resilience.

69
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,330
They keep talking about it.
Here we are a year later,

70
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,560
nothing has been done unlike Sarbanes
Oxley,

71
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,140
which done in 31 days.
But I think firms need to have that

72
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,760
resilience.
One of them has ever,

73
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,761
resilience is never to get so much
leverage and drive your firms so hard

74
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,100
that you don't have the cash to fall
back on when you hit a crisis.

75
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,060
That's why General Motors went bankrupt.
And that's why Ford,

76
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,310
uh,
came through the crisis because they'd

77
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,390
taken out $24 billion in loans and,
uh,

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,680
that allow,
has allowed for it to come through.

79
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,960
That's very strong.
Where as GM and Chrysler had to get

80
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,920
bailed out by the government.
