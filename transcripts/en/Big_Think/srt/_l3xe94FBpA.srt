1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,250
All right.
I do still feel that a great collection

2
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:13,840
is not based necessarily on value.
Um,

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,590
if I was putting together an American
industrial design collection,

4
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:21,170
which I've kind of dabbled with over the
years,

5
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:26,171
it's absolutely possible to put in
artifacts,

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,290
whether it's a meat slicer by Egmont
errands or an outboard motor or a

7
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:37,070
cocktail shaker that you can acquire on
Ebay.

8
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:42,071
You can acquire at the low budget kind
of swap meet shows like the triple pier

9
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,130
show here in Manhattan where you can,
you can only spend a few hundred dollars

10
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:49,700
for some of these things,
but it's how selective you are.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,250
I think there's two forms of
collections.

12
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:56,980
There's collections that take a
curatorial eye and really just focused

13
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,550
on a certain theme and develop that
theme and every piece juxtaposes with

14
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,770
each other.
And then there's the great obsessives,

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,830
the the people that have to have
everything by that designer and maybe

16
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:13,400
those collectors,
the best of that group are the ones who

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,610
as years go by,
are not afraid to refine that collection

18
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:21,380
and sell off certain stuff that isn't
quite holding the test of time.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,800
So I identify with both the obsessive
compulsive collecting community and the

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,860
minimalist.
I want to Imitate v try and create a

21
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:31,990
perfect chair collection.
