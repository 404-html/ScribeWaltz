1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,420
Well,
I don't know that every manager in the

2
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:14,060
world who's a Buddhist is necessarily a
good manager.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,270
On the other hand,
there are certain elements of Buddhism I

4
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:22,271
think are very positive for management,
especially now such as let go of the

5
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:27,470
past and if you look at coaches,
there was a study done on coaches and

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,070
Buddha believed that anyone can change.
You know what the study showed?

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,820
Coaches who believe people can change
are much more effective than those who

8
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:38,120
do not believe.
People can change the well.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,880
Amazingly.
Some people don't believe other people

10
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,580
can change other pretty useless as
coaches.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,520
So I.
my Buddhist philosophy is a simple one.

12
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:51,521
It basically involves let go of the past
except what is move forward.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,180
Make the best of what you have.
Be Happy and content.
