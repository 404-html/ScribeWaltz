1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,263
Well,

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,700
even the extravagant
spending proposals,

3
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:17,610
which is what I'm calling for it,
we're talking about on the order of four

4
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,730
percent of GDP now,
we have debt.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,340
I should check that number.
I believe we have a debt GDP ratio and

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,140
then 50 percent ish range right now.
That's not good.

7
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,850
It's been rising in,
in,

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,610
in the absence of a major war,
which is not supposed to happen,

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,840
but I look at other advanced countries
they've managed to have or ourselves.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,970
We had a debt to GDP ratio of 125
percent at the end of World War Two and

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,790
paid it down and never.
There was never a question about the

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,770
good faith and credit of the US
government.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,910
Even advanced countries with fairly weak
governments,

14
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:52,020
uh,
Belgium,

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,110
Italy have managed to have a debt debt
equal to or greater than GDP.

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,880
So we have a lot of running room as long
as there's a reasonable presumption that

17
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,460
we will in the end,
do what's necessary to bring our

18
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,640
finances under control.
It's not that we can't afford to spend

19
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,140
this much.
Um,

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,010
it's and,
and the,

21
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:16,910
the alternative not,
not providing the stimulus is just to

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,260
run the risk of a truly frightening.
