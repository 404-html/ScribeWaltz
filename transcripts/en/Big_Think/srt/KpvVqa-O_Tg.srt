1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,620
So many people have asked blockchain
technology,

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,720
provide answers to challenges that
typically have suffered from lack of

3
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,870
technology that they've suffered from
poor technology applications.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,200
One of those being the way the voting
works in the United States.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,950
Uh,
there's a,

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,850
I think of this in three different
distinct phases,

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,310
right?
There's the phase before voting were

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,500
keeping track of who is registered to
vote,

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,800
uh,
and where they're allowed to vote has

10
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,810
seems it's been harder than it should
have been,

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,550
right?
We have a lot of examples of people

12
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:39,700
showing up at polling places and being
denied the right to vote.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,320
Uh,
it,

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,480
it seems like paperwork goes missing and
people get removed from voting roles,

15
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:47,890
that sort of thing.
A public ledger that tracks who is

16
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,430
registered to vote were and allowed
people to look at that from their home

17
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,830
machine and then confirm that when they
showed up at the pole,

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,070
would do a lot to reestablish trust in
the process of registering to vote and

19
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,350
validating that everybody who is
entitled to vote,

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,850
uh,
is able to do that right.

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,860
Providing an independent verification of
that.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,073
Um,
the,

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,830
uh,
there's a second phase I'll get to in a

24
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,810
bit,
but there's a third phase which is after

25
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:13,330
the vote,
when you're taking the totals that come

26
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,670
from a polling place that come from,
you know,

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,080
vote by mail,
for example,

28
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:20,140
in Oregon,
we have to kind of trust that the system

29
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:20,711
works,
right?

30
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:24,640
We have to hope that everything is
counted correctly at the local level and

31
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,640
then it's totaled up correctly,
the state level and then reported

32
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:30,820
nationally,
etc. And we're fortunately the point

33
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:31,531
where that,
that,

34
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,460
that,
the basis of that trust hasn't been

35
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,710
violated yet,
but in many countries it is in many

36
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,020
countries,
there's not a lot of confidence that the

37
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:42,340
total from a polling place is actually a
accurately summed up.

38
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,890
Right.
So using A distributed ledger,

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,880
not to track the individual votes,
but to track the totals from each of the

40
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:52,690
polling places would be a way to allow
the public to understand,

41
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,900
okay,
the local polling place I went and voted

42
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,320
at is reporting a thousand votes,
500 for candidate x 500 for candidate.

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,790
Why?
That seems about right.

44
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,860
I don't know if my vote specifically
counted,

45
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,400
but I know that at least the polling
place I was at counted appropriately and

46
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:09,130
they didn't try to be pretend they were
100,000 votes.

47
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,350
Right?
So at the beginning of that process and

48
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:14,800
the tail end of that process using a
public distributed ledger to record that

49
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,860
makes a lot of sense,
but in the middle of the actual act of

50
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,810
walking into a booth and registering to
vote or um,

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,730
a lot of people want to do voting by
mobile device or by,

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,820
by computer.
I'm very worried about that.

53
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,240
The digitization of that.
Our computers fail us all the time and

54
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,860
malware and other,
other,

55
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,140
uh,
threats could really step in and make it

56
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:36,940
so that I think I'm voting for one
candidate,

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,070
but it gets recorded for another.
Right?

58
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,470
And we have to think in,
in the United States,

59
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:44,020
we care quite a bit about the
confidentiality of our vote.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,820
Uh,
even to the point where I get no

61
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:46,631
receipt,
right?

62
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,480
I can't go to a bar and proved that I
voted for somebody and get a discount

63
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,081
for it.
Right?

64
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,530
That would be considered bribery,
so we can't simply come up with a system

65
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:57,670
that puts all the original votes into a
public ledger and provides proof that

66
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,760
somebody voted away a certain or that
becomes a corruptive process.

67
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,450
So I think we still need voter verified
paper balance as a path to auditing,

68
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,140
but with the registration,
the beginning and the summit at the end

69
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,770
conducted by a public ledger think we
would do a tremendous amount to

70
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,660
reestablish confidence in the voting
system.
