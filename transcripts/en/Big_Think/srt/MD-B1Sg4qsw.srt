1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,170
It's clear that in terms of optimistic
positivity is a predictor of mortality.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,390
It does predict mortality and it
predicts mortality when you control for

3
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,020
lots of different,
uh,

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,170
self reported health problems,
depression scales that have been

5
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:22,520
validated,
self reported health.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,910
If you're interested in predicting
things from optimism or optimistic

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,640
positivity,
you want to look at what predicts it.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,220
And that's what I was focusing on in
that first paper.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,280
So we have three papers already started.
Basically we're looking at,

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,970
uh,
explicit measures of optimism as well as

11
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:47,140
these were using wording effects,
um,

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,940
to measure what we calling him.
Implicit measures of,

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,300
uh,
close to perceptual optimism and

14
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:57,410
pessimism.
That positive wording bias is a form of

15
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:59,420
optimism.
But if you're looking at the world in

16
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:02,690
more positive ways,
you're taking information in and you're

17
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:06,470
framing it in positive ways and you're
seeing it so you're reacting to it and

18
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:08,030
positive ways sometimes in the way that
you,

19
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:09,650
you don't even know that you're doing
right.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,690
It's so subtle.
It's like a wording effect that you

21
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,040
couldn't say that you,
you know,

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,220
it's not like I'm asking you,
are you responding this way to these

23
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,060
words of that,
those ways,

24
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:19,490
that words,
we can detect it statistically over

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,280
people.
So when you're asking people to say

26
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,890
things about themselves on a survey,
for example,

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,690
you're asking them,
you know,

28
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:30,020
are you a good person?
Are you a competent person?

29
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,270
Um,
there's a whole series of questions you

30
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:33,590
can ask them.
Some of them will,

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,620
uh,
already positively some of them and

32
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:38,480
negatively.
And usually those wording,

33
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,300
uh,
those survey questions are,

34
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,070
uh,
used to,

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,610
uh,
to create scales of things like self

36
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:50,930
esteem,
self efficacy mastery.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,260
There's a latent variable.
The idea is that there's something out

38
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,290
there.
It's latent and it explained some

39
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,720
variance in how people answer these
questions.

40
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,490
And we're putting that together with
some measures that acts.

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,230
Pete,
ask people about how optimistic they are

42
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,290
using language explicitly and saying
that together those things create this

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,140
phenomenon.
And we're saying that the phenomenon

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,330
goes deep,
uh,

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,220
to level of perception is itself a form
of,

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,230
uh,
of stratification.

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,620
If is there something about optimism
that's,

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,650
uh,
that's a resource that we can understand

49
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,960
as a psychological good,
like happiness,

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,440
right?
And so if it's stratified in the

51
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,540
population,
how is it an associated with other kinds

52
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,460
of stratification in column and,
and,

53
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,780
and so forth.
Education.

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,920
And so,
uh,

55
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,731
you know,
you saying,

56
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,170
well,
class,

57
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,670
the real interesting one is class,
right?

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,200
Everybody wants to know,
you know,

59
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,040
or
pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

60
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,090
You know,
think positively.

61
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,830
You'll be successful if you're
optimistic,

62
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:55,760
you will be successful.
Right?

63
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:56,720
But of course,
if it's successful,

64
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:59,980
you're gonna be optimistic.
So there's the reverse thing.

65
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,090
And so taking a class and looking at
classes,

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,070
really the really interesting part of
that I want to get to,

67
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,050
right.
And I think that's an interesting

68
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,490
question because there's a lot of theory
around sociology and emotions around,

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,590
uh,
the,

70
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,090
the idea that expectations are created,
the ability to meet expectations

71
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,560
generates energy.
That energy is what allows people to do

72
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,394
things.

73
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,960
It's something that emotional energy and
then,

74
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,690
uh,
it replicates itself.

75
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,410
Yeah.

76
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,160
So people are convinced to be
optimistic,

77
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,360
especially in the middle classes.

78
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,040
Okay.

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,980
And if they're not able to achieve those
expectations,

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,500
then that energy goes down and they
become dissatisfied.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,920
There's some difference with cohorts.
And now I see with race difference,

82
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,770
I see cohort differences when you were
born.

83
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,930
And that makes sense in terms of things
like civil rights movement and what you

84
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,150
experienced in your life,
right?

85
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,131
And,
and,

86
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:03,580
and,
and your hopes and dreams and,

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,170
and so forth.
So,

88
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,230
um,
the question I'm looking at now first,

89
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,310
of course,
is,

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,780
well,
you can't change,

91
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,920
you know,
not many.

92
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,830
There's not much way that your optimism
or pessimism going to change your gender

93
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,140
in a statistically significant way.
You know,

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,540
night change.
People can change their gender,

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,480
but it's not gonna Change your age.
It's not gonna Change your birth cohort

96
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,680
and,
you know,

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,300
race,
very small effects.

98
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,540
So I'm looking at those things that
influence,

99
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,950
that can be understood as causes of,
and they can't be reversed causality

100
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,784
first.

101
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,770
So that's what I've been doing.
And,

102
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:38,110
uh,
we ran these models and what do we see?

103
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,340
Well we did.
We saw that when you look at all these

104
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,300
things,
race,

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,171
birth,
cohort,

106
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:48,460
age and gender together,
that there's these curves and the curves

107
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,740
are interesting.
They start off with men being more

108
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:55,120
optimistic than women.
There's a convergence in midlife and

109
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,931
then a divergence.
Again,

110
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,760
we're metamor optimistic,
optimistic,

111
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:00,070
positivity,
higher optimistic positivity than women,

112
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,550
right?
We see your race trends.

113
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,010
Um,
and uh,

114
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,070
and those vary by cohort.
People born before 1932 whites.

115
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm more optimistic than blacks for all
of these people.

116
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,050
Um,
optimism,

117
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,850
optimistic,
positivity declines with age,

118
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,650
right?
So we're seeing these trends over time,

119
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:23,140
declining with age,
but whites and more optimistic than

120
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:27,370
blocks and it's declining.
But for people born after 1932,

121
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,580
we see blacks having higher levels of
optimists.

122
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,870
Dick Putz,
these Americans,

123
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:32,020
right?

124
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,750
All US data,
uh,

125
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,200
high higher levels of optimistic
positivity than whites over the over age

126
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,550
period.
They are still declining.

127
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,040
That's optimistic positivity.
What about a pessimistic negativity,

128
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,030
right?
Uh,

129
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,110
blacks consistently higher than whites,
um,

130
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,940
in,
in this past pessimistic negativity

131
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,760
across cohorts.
So we can look at those things and say,

132
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,960
you know,
people who got more schooling past high

133
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,880
school,
you know,

134
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,570
they were optimistic when we first
measured them and,

135
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
and,
and they were more likely to get some

136
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,650
schooling and we can try to control for
other things and say it's,

137
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,110
it's really the optimism that's
influencing the schooling.

138
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,360
We could also try to say,
you know,

139
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,210
their,
their class background is influencing

140
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,120
their optimism and pessimism and I think
that's,

141
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,050
we have run better position to say
something about that.

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,370
We can look at them over 25 years.
We don't have what you were born with.

143
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,330
Right.
We don't have,

144
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,490
when you started off with,
right,

145
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,870
we do have what your parents,
what income your parents made,

146
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,450
you know,
what school you,

147
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,410
you know,
how much schooling you got and so forth.

148
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,990
I was thinking about this was that I
really came of age.

149
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,250
I be,
I graduated high school in 1976 as the

150
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
great society programs were in place,
there was really opportunity for people

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,970
who base,
I went to some of the high,

152
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,440
uh,
with that time it was called

153
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,880
Slummerville.
Leno wasn't very,

154
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,040
it's a place now that's very,
uh,

155
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,200
houses worth millions of dollars and so
forth.

156
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,240
But at that time,
it was a working class neighborhood.

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,610
Uh,
I wasn't a great students.

158
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,530
I got into university,
I did well in university because when we

159
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,650
option I saw was joining the air force
or the Army and,

160
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,970
uh,
nonprofit.

161
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,110
I'm a professor,
right?

162
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:23,111
So I was thinking about
my career in the con and in terms of,

163
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:27,500
uh,
this project and the opportunities I've

164
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,334
had.

165
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,140
And I mean,
I,

166
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm a pessimistic person,
but I took advantage of the

167
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,950
opportunities because I saw that there
were doors.

168
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:39,410
The Way Society is structured is that
there's doors and if you can jump

169
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,680
through them,
it doesn't really matter what your skill

170
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:43,550
is,
that much,

171
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,880
their divisions are fine grained.
And if you can get through that door and

172
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,330
you get all sorts of resources and then
you're gonna get to the next level.

173
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,210
So I became an optimistic about
academia,

174
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,730
uh,
in a way that allowed me to continue to

175
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,300
put my nose to the grindstone and not to
think too much about it because the

176
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,800
resources were there.
Right.

177
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,090
I made the decision.
Yeah.

178
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,670
It,
but really the point I wanted to make

179
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,830
was these policies,
these programs,

180
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:14,831
kids don't have them anymore.
Like now I teach and uh,

181
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,190
and uh,
the kids see that the middle is getting

182
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:19,910
hollowed out.

183
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,490
Right.
And they're anxious.

184
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,080
Mental health problems and university
have gone through the roof,

185
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,150
right.
And,

186
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,190
uh,
university don't know how to do with it.

187
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,350
Um,
so,

188
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,920
and I can see why they have,
because the opportunities aren't there

189
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,870
and the kids realize that there's a
bifurcation,

190
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:40,310
right.
There's a make it a break.

191
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,190
Um,
so,

192
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,490
uh,
I look at myself,

193
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,380
I look at my own history and I say,
I,

194
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,710
I was the intel end of the baby boom.
And you know,

195
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,550
I profited economically,
uh,

196
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,770
in some way,
socially in some ways,

197
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,670
but you know,
in other ways,

198
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,740
maybe not.
Uh,

199
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,780
and so I look at these generational
differences now and I can understand now

200
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,190
you should,
going back to business,

201
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,180
right?
Going in,

202
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,840
somebody gets a job in the GIG economy,
right?

203
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,160
What's their mentality?
Like there's another gig down the road.

204
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,740
I'll make it work to the extent I can,
or,

205
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,350
or has it become like,
is this has to really work?

206
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:24,450
And if this doesn't work,
I'm screwed.

207
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,860
Right.
My career,

208
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,020
I don't really know.
I don't think anybody really knows

209
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,020
what's happening.
And these areas that you're interested

210
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,180
in terms of work,
you know,

211
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,010
and what the possibilities are,
are there,

212
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,260
there's some interesting questions that
you have to ask.
