1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,260
Do you have to know when to say goodbye
to pieces that you love but just don't

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,970
make economic sense?
Um,

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,540
it's the toughest thing for me to do
because I like,

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,220
I think I fantasize myself as some sort
of,

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,320
you know,
curator on a deadline every,

6
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,370
every,
every season.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,380
Um,
there are always the two to $3,000

8
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:34,381
experiments that do not make economic
sense in which I get wrapped on the

9
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:35,730
knuckles.
You know,

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,240
you know,
by,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,530
you know,
fellow executives at Southerby's,

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,680
you without a doubt the trend,
you know,

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,690
in the better 20th century design
options is to focus on the higher and

14
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,910
higher value.
It's what makes economic sense.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,320
And,
um,

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,040
without a doubt I spend much more of my
time focusing on the few pieces that are

17
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:04,711
worth in the six figures then I can with
collections of objects that are worth a

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,270
few thousand dollars a piece.
So the most difficult thing is to say

19
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:15,271
goodbye to a piece that you know,
that if you really treated it with,

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,760
with a kind of reverence,
you could,

21
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,940
you know,
introduced to a new group of collectors,

22
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,640
but that it's just not ready yet for
primetime.

23
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:25,840
And then,
and then you hate it.

24
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:28,660
If that piece ends up at a,
at a smaller auction house,

25
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:30,970
and you know,
maybe it doesn't get photographed very

26
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,430
well,
or maybe it ends up on Ebay and you

27
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,320
know,
but you have to,

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,210
you have to know when.
