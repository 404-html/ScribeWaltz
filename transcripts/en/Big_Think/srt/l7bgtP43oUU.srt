1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,830
That's a tough question,
but I mean we don't have a lot of

2
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:17,820
natural resources as a country.
We have a very beautiful country

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,910
visually.
I mean everyone goes out about green

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,060
that's in the mountains and the rivers
and it's clean and it's not populated.

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,270
It is stunningly beautiful,
but we've no oil.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,220
We've no cold with no money.
We just have our Ireland,

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
but we're theory I have is we come from
a suppressed culture.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
We're,
we're,

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,390
we're one of the most invaded countries
ever.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,870
I think the British started very early,
could be like $800.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
I decided to come and show us at the
Danes and the norse and we've had a

12
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,590
tough time,
but pretty much a similar culture would

13
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,860
be to Jewish culture.
They had a pretty hard time,

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,550
uh,
there were being kicked around for a

15
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:09,510
long,
long time.

16
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:13,740
So when that happens,
when people try to take your culture

17
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:18,741
away from you and your assets of your
culture becomes stronger,

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,490
it's like even in Africa,
you know,

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,620
when you see African Americans,
they're stronger because of what they've

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,003
gone through.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,980
It's even sublingual.
I think it becomes in the genes,

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,490
but our language was even taken from us.
Uh,

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,440
the Irish Gaelic language was outlawed
at the religion was outlawed,

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
hence the religion later being stronger,
stronger to a negative point of view.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,270
Uh,
but our revenge was.

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,160
I mean,
if you listen to Irish language,

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,750
it's,
it's very complicated,

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,730
but it's very poetic to say hello and
Ireland is weakest.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,630
Lydia,
which translated means sunshine of God

30
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,510
on you.
And that's a lot nicer than hello.

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,340
You know what I mean?
And goodbye as slung Ghanaian Jambo,

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,540
her laugh which made it's a wave and may
the road rise,

33
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,210
which you,
which is a very well known phrase and

34
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:23,211
that's a really nice way to say goodbye.
So there was ingrained poetry.

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,260
And then when you look back at our
history in the 20th century,

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,360
the last century,
probably the greatest writers of the

37
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:38,361
20th century were Irish.
You go from Beckett to Joyce to being,

38
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,850
to,
to Shaw,

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
to Oscar Wilde.
He just go,

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,290
Jesus,
what's going on here?

41
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,790
All these guys.
And,

42
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,020
and the most famous book in the world
could be ulysses after the Bible.

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,010
But that was almost like a revenge on
how dare you take our culture from us.

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,150
So it became our only weapon was our
poetry or music.

45
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
And if you listen to Irish music,
I think we've more than say the celts

46
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,590
came from the Middle East.
So really I'm an Arab.

47
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,730
She listened to the way they said,
listen,

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,160
listen to a similar,
like Sinead O'connor site,

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,390
you know,
you could be Muslim,

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,090
you know that anx,
that's another layer that whale.

51
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,013
So,
uh,

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,310
I think it's in our genes.
I think certain stuff is in our genes,

53
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,610
like nobody can dance like a black guy.
It's in the genes so we don't have oil,

54
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:50,191
but we have poetry
for the not very well.

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,460
I,
I'm not a huge fan of the Celtic tiger.

56
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,490
I was so glad that you could see people
being prosperous and you didn't see

57
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:04,440
people begging that the city started
looking good,

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,470
that people had jobs.
But it's almost like if you have such a

59
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,610
hard time for so long,
then you turn around and give a kid a

60
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:18,000
check for a million quid,
they're going to go nuts.

61
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,490
And we went a bit nuts.
We went up,

62
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,770
harass,
certainly everyone started sounding very

63
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:28,530
American,
which freaked me at the.

64
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,610
Oh my God syndrome kicked in really
quick and I,

65
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:37,140
I got a fright at the bubble is burst
time,

66
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,800
towels,
time tells everything we,

67
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,510
we blew it too quickly,
you know,

68
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,960
but it wasn't totally our fault because
the big boys that run those banks,

69
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,090
they messed up America.
They've missed,

70
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,020
it's up Europe,
they've messed up the world.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,830
And really it's the start of the 21st
century.

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,250
We've got to rethink things.
Socialism and communism don't work but

73
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:07,540
needed a straightforward capitalism.
We've got to get a new way of thinking

74
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,030
and working.
We blew it.

75
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,470
So there was good and bad about about
the Celtic tiger.

76
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,630
But we're tiny,
right?

77
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,910
This 4 million in the country,
do you know what I mean?

78
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,990
We're tiny.
4 million in the country and he's in New

79
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,670
York.
Seven 10,

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,830
you know?
But uh,

81
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,580
but we're strong.
So hopefully we pulled through and you

82
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:35,230
never really know until you get
perspective copany years away.

83
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,830
But I really disliked the fact that our
culture is what make us.

84
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,760
And made us and will make us.
And when money came in,

85
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,850
we rejected it so quickly.
Not even rejected.

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,310
We didn't think.
We just got lazy and all the girls

87
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,880
started getting fast.
And that's not good.

88
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:58,180
Is it?
