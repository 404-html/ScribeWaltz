1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,820
To
the infrastructure

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,550
sector,
that's our greatest need.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,210
We plan to invest and this is a
conservative estimate,

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,480
$300,000,000,000 in the next few years
into infrastructure.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,860
This will go into roads and airports,
into the railways,

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,150
into ports,
and I would say to anybody going into

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,670
infrastructure,
because the need is there,

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,330
it's recognized a lot of projects that
have already been prepared.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,850
The government is,
for example,

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,240
a organizing mega power projects in
which all the preliminary work will have

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,510
been done by government of India itself
and by the state government.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,440
So as soon as you go in,
you can start putting up the power plant

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,150
and we are an energy short country.
We are short of a lot of power.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,100
And in order to sustain this kind of
regional growth infrastructure is going

15
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,290
to be the greatest challenge

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,590
for us.
That's one of the most interesting

17
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,900
phenomenon.
The

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,150
Indian entrepreneurship or you have of
course a lot of very highly recognizable

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,860
names of Indian origin entrepreneurs in
the United States itself.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,770
Uh,
the head of Pepsi Co is an Indian woman

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,150
in the head of the new head of Citi
Group.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,700
Uh,
Vikram Pandit is an Indian origin

23
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,790
person.
I'm the head of Roman Hoss,

24
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,860
which has just been bought up as you
know,

25
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,380
I was an Indian origin person,
Raj Gupta.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,840
These are examples really of Indians who
have benefited from the fine American

27
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:54,481
education and have had the opportunity
but have grasped the opportunity to rise

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,970
on the Indian side.
Uh,

29
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:02,971
we have a number of groups which have
grown tremendously.

30
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,520
Daughters is possibly the most well
known,

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,280
but also in forces.
Wipro,

32
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,800
the powdered forge group,
Bobby Lloyd,

33
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm this,
that in fact,

34
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:23,701
if you looked at India and you look at
the companies that are now our top 2015

35
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,060
of them didn't exist 15 years ago or 20
years ago.

36
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,330
So you can see that there's a lot of new
entrepreneurs and an interest.

37
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,890
Another interesting phenomenon is that
in the family owned businesses in India,

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,700
we now have the second generation who is
coming in to take over and run these

39
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,110
companies.
Most of them have had,

40
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,320
uh,
been to business schools in the United

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,320
States or in India and they are running
their business operations

42
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,980
nationally than was the case.
