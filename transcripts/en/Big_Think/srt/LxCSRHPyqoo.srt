1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,403
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,530
I think it's a bad idea when people try
to design ways to create a public life,

3
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,770
a public square that's free of religion
and the religion talk because there are

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,260
people from,
that's how they're comfortable talking.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,670
Some people like Tom to economic theory
or some people have a historical view of

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,220
the world.
Some people have a view of the world

7
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:29,430
that comes from their faith.
People's views come all different

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,290
sources.
I think it's important to have a public

9
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:36,291
square that embraces these different
ways of looking at the world and if

10
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,360
there's something that I believe about
public life that's really it,

11
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:43,740
that it ought to be open and we ought to
really try to have actual dialogue and

12
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:48,741
think about dialogue to make it real is
we have to engage in listening with our

13
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,370
ears.
When we tend to do in America is listen

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,213
with our mouths.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,760
We tend to listen to the other fellows
argument for the sole purpose of

16
00:00:56,761 --> 00:01:01,230
spotting the errors so we can refute it.
The absurdity that they call

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,540
presidential debates in America,
which are not debates at all,

18
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,720
but joint press conference is run by and
for the media.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,490
I think candidates should avoid them
like the plague.

20
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,920
They're horrible,
but that absurdity captures what I mean.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,910
There's no time there for a measured
conversation.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,480
There's no time there to explain a
position.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,500
All you have time do is lash out,
call somebody's name,

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,290
use the right buzzwords in it's somebody
else's turn.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,840
Well,
that's not democracy.

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,650
That's a mockery.
That is simply a,

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,580
an excuse for avoiding what we really
need,

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,830
which is actual conversation.
Of course,

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,680
our differences instead of buzzwords and
name calling across our differences.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,120
[inaudible].
