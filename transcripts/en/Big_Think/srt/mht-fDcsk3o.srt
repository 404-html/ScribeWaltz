1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,630
Can I look back over time and you say,
oh,

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,440
things are basically improved for the
greater lot of mankind.

3
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:22,460
There's always been a lot of problems
right now they're acute and we're more

4
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:26,420
interconnected and problems can infect
other parts of the world much more

5
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,830
easily.
But to date,

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,370
the lot of mankind,
I believe has generally gotten better.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,980
There's been big setbacks.
Look at World War II,

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,100
look at Chairman Mao's great leap
forward,

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,000
the dark ages,
but in general,

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,300
like the stock market,
you might have a bull market in the bear

11
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,120
market.
I do think in the end,

12
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:47,350
uh,
you know,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,600
problems can be dealt with and that
mankind will continue to improve on a

14
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:52,940
whole.
