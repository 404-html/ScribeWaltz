1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,460
There's not a week that goes by that
they don't get an email,

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:13,461
a phone call from a random person who
wants advice on how to enter the

3
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:18,240
nonprofit sector in the unit to have a
career in the nonprofit sector,

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,000
uh,
because they think it's where they can

5
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,650
find the most fulfillment.
And this is really inspiring to see so

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,300
many people,
uh,

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,550
from young people to mid career
professionals,

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,620
even retired professionals wanting to go
into the social impact space because say

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,450
they,
uh,

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,460
are convinced that this is where they
would find the most fulfillment.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,960
But you know,
the reverse can be true as well because

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,710
burnout in the nonprofit sector is a
very real thing.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,110
In fact,
there,

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,990
ah,
I once had the conversation with a group

15
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,360
of monastics from,
uh,

16
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:58,410
the group of teak,
not Han who said that the people who

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,010
visit their,
um,

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
their monastery in France too,
to take some time off on a retreat are

19
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,500
mostly coming from the nonprofit sector
because they become so burnt out.

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,530
They become so disillusioned.
They become just so fatigued by the

21
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,650
causes of the nonstop,
uh,

22
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,000
at tvt that is required of them.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,370
But I have also encountered so many
people who,

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,580
uh,
I mean they barely make a living and

25
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,560
they're,
the way they make their living exposes

26
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,620
them to the most miserable conditions
and the planet where there's,

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,890
there's abuse,
there's a war,

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,980
there's hunger,
there's poverty and there's not even a

29
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,740
comfortable place to sleep.
And what is it,

30
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:48,130
what is it about these people that uh,
that keep,

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,561
uh,
what,

32
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,730
what is it that keeps him happy
regardless?

33
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,830
And there are a few things that I
learned.

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,520
This is among the people who actually
choose to be in the nonprofit sector.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,760
One is that they have a life outside of
their work.

36
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,191
You know,
they,

37
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:03,900
they do not associate themselves with
the cause.

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,890
They are not the cause.
So they actually have an identity

39
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,950
outside of their work and they treat it
as a job like any other.

40
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,880
The other thing I saw in these people is
that,

41
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,980
uh,
they think when,

42
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:17,521
when,
you know,

43
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,550
when you're in a,
when you're in a situation where you're

44
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,180
constantly asking people for help,
you're constantly fundraising,

45
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,240
you're constantly asking for support,
uh,

46
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,400
you know,
to sign this petition to donate to this

47
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,700
cause it then you,
you start to feel that you are in a

48
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,160
position of need all the time.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,250
And that's wrong because that can make
you feel really depleted.

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,230
What I saw in these people is that they
may see themselves as having something

51
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:47,070
to offer all the time.
So they don't see themselves as a needy

52
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,670
one in every situation.
They actually see themselves as able to

53
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,890
give something,
give something in return,

54
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,770
and that empowers them in a
conversation.

55
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,760
The other thing I noticed about people
who are working in very,

56
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,360
very,
um,

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,160
miserable situations but nevertheless
find so much fulfillment is that they

58
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:10,270
are,
uh,

59
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,190
they find strength in their group.
They never do it alone and they don't

60
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:20,191
have what I call the founder's syndrome.
Sometimes when you're too close to the

61
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,330
essay,
the nonprofit that you started,

62
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:25,180
or the cause that your,
your name,

63
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,440
uh,
stands for,

64
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,390
then it becomes your,
uh,

65
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,840
it becomes your identity and it becomes
too,

66
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,770
too closely,
uh,

67
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,530
entangled with every single thing about
your life.

68
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,390
But no,
the people I learned who,

69
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:44,680
who maintain a healthy balance or those
who are able to take a step back and

70
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,510
still enjoy things outside of their
work.

71
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,300
Okay.
