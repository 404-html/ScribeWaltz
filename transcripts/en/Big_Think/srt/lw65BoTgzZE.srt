1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,430
Question,
I think we're gonna lose a lot,

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,570
almost whatever we do because there's so
many species right now that are on the

3
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:20,640
brink of extinction.
I mean the break,

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,570
there are a number of trees,
species and flowering plants.

5
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:27,940
We should what you're known for one
individual

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,520
and there are a bird species for
example,

7
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:38,521
that are down to a few dozen individual.
We have to rhinoceros species two out of

8
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:44,551
the five that existed on the planet that
are 300 individual or fewer left.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,460
So a lot of those we're going to lose
probably no matter what we do,

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,530
especially those which we don't even
know yet exist.

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,210
And we may never know they ever existed.
If they go extinct before we can learn

12
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:06,211
enough about the world's biodiversity.
But if we plan our use of the

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,980
environment in the future intelligently
and drive towards the goal of

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,530
sustainable development,
that is a development in producers,

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,850
increasing quality of life and security
for people,

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,440
uh,
but reduces the amount of materials and

17
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:34,441
energy that we're using up.
And if we intelligently plan a,

18
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,260
the establishment of reserves where,
uh,

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,700
we get the maximum protection for the
largest number of species.

20
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,490
And that's one thing.
The conservation organizations like

21
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:52,540
conservation international,
which we have served on the board,

22
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,570
are devoted.
Uh,

23
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,830
then I think we'll save a majority of
the remaining pictures.
