1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,610
With respect to that,
I have to say that less than five

2
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:16,540
percent of Alzheimer Diseases are
genetic trust meter.

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,290
So 95 percent are not genetically
transmitted.

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,370
And uh,
generally speaking,

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,390
the ones that are genetically
transmitted,

6
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:29,940
the,
they tend to occur at earlier ages than

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,480
adult is not a general rule,
but more often people who have it

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,610
because of genetic reasons that a five
percent of the people population,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,140
uh,
they have it at the earlier ages,

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,280
but it's only five percent
or less than five percent,

11
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,810
about five.
That number.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,920
It's not that in China there is more
than America,

13
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,580
less than Europe.
There is more or less than here and

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,590
there,
but there are a particular population

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,750
that in a tigger circumstances that
could lead to dementia.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
And,
uh,

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,280
because of,
uh,

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,090
the habits of those,
uh,

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,830
the population,
there are small groups of people.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,610
For instance,
uh,

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,890
in the,
in the Pacific,

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,090
they were population.

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,700
They used to eat the brain of the dead
people.

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,410
And then they were transferring disease,
which one of the symptoms of the disease

25
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:39,640
was dementia and they were all
developing goodman's over there.

26
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:44,641
There was a higher incidence of dementia
just because of this habit of hitting

27
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,730
the brain of the people that were that
and therefore like an infectious

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,300
disease,
they were transferring the disease for

29
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:58,780
one,
two and higher incidents of people

30
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:03,040
affected.
This is once this was found in this

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,100
habits where it stopped,
then the incidents of disease became the

32
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:13,291
same as a,
with in other populations

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,200
in general.
You know,

34
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:24,201
if you look at our society,
there is not a population of people or

35
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,580
you know,
that is more affected by the loss of

36
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,520
memory.
It is a problem.

37
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:35,300
And that heats with aging.
So something related with the,

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,120
with aging.
And so as we age,

39
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,800
we get more memory,
more memory problem.

40
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,460
Obviously not all people are equal.
There are some one,

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,930
a better memory than others.
And uh,

42
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,020
and we do not know why some people have
a better memory than others.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,420
I mean,
we say that,

44
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,590
uh,
that,

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,910
um,
they,

46
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,160
uh,
free keep ourselves and our brand

47
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:10,660
exercises just like a muscle,
a gen,

48
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:15,661
we tend to have memory problems,
less memory problems.

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,810
So it kind of protective the activity of
mental activity.

50
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,610
Even some people think even physical
activity,

51
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,150
it could be protected against the memory
loss,

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,850
the loss of memory.
Um,

53
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,040
that's what,
uh,

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,160
I have to say I'm obviously,
there are diseases which are associated.

55
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,250
The one of the most typical one is
Alzheimer's disease which are associated

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,360
with the loss of memory and a
hardass but are of less relevance and

57
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:02,921
less
and the characteristic symptoms of our

58
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,330
symptom of Alzheimer's disease,
which is really whole market disease,

59
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:12,000
is the loss of what we call short term
memory.

60
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,960
So that's how the disease starts.
Actually.

61
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,960
It's people who can not remember what
they just did,

62
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:22,910
the justice,
a very short term memory loss and that's

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,770
last for very,
very long time.

64
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,210
And progressively the memory problem get
worse and worse.

65
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,140
Um,
and only at the late stage of Alzheimer

66
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:38,670
disease,
it's also longterm memory is affected.

67
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:42,180
But the major characteristic of
Alzheimer disease,

68
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,870
which is a very widespread disease in
the population patient at old age is the

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,420
loss of short term memory.
