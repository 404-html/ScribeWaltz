1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,130
Well,
I think with the onslaught of celebrity

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,610
and our fascination with celebrity at
such a high pitched level that fashion,

3
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,230
which is kind of its younger sister or
second cousin,

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,810
um,
that idea of celebrity designers are

5
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,770
very glamorous.
They dress store let's the red carpet,

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,170
um,
the handbag business has gone crazy.

7
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:36,171
So the general population has really
understood fashion way that it never has

8
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,880
in generations before.
And it's reached,

9
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:42,270
I think a kind of celebrity,
semi celebrity level where the

10
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,580
designers,
the models,

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,230
uh,
and even,

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,390
you know,
Anna Winter and the devil wears Prada

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,570
have become large celebrities in their
own rights that has elevated the fashion

14
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,510
show to a semi,
you know,

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,000
Papa Razzi event where,
uh,

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,800
people can be photographed.
Famous people go to the shows,

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,940
famous models are seen in the
collections and designers that are world

18
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,510
renowned and famous are seen.
I'm going in and out of,

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,190
out of these shows and these tests.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,240
The seeding is I'm slightly medieval
process.

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,670
Um,
but yes,

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,770
everybody likes to get the best seat
that they can.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,550
And a lot of editors are very unhappy if
they're in the second row or the third

24
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,980
row,
which is basically considered Siberia.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,300
So,
uh,

26
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:32,301
if you are an editor of good standing,
you usually have a front row seat at the

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,140
major collection.
That's the major shows in New York for

28
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:37,620
sure.
Oh,

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,330
the ORC leads that often,
I must say.

30
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,450
I think that's probably an appropriate
place for it to be.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,230
Um,
New York is a solid place for fashion.

32
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,510
It's a consistently good place for
fashion.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,010
However,
it's not the innovator,

34
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:55,011
it's not the real creative juice that we
all seek and that the retailers seek to

35
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,020
really get ourselves,
makes us excited about the stories we're

36
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:01,290
going to put your magazines and the
clothes that are going to be bought and

37
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,540
purchased in and ultimately bought in
the stores.

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm particularly this season,
I don't think it was one of New York's

39
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,590
best seasons.
I think it was a very beige season.

40
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,110
And with that comes a certain sort of
banality.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,850
Um,
there's nothing that glamorous and

42
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,550
dramatic about the color of beige.
Um,

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,540
so I think that's kind of a metaphor for
a little bit with the seasons.

44
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,190
However,
we do have a store and he's a major

45
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,150
story.
He continues to shock and rock and,

46
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:27,960
and push us forward.
And that's Marc Jacobs and indeed his,

47
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,090
both his collections this time we're,
we're very,

48
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,040
very powerful.
His Marc Jacobs collection,

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,180
which I just looked at in person and
uptight up close to feel the fabrics and

50
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:37,720
to see the accessories.
Um,

51
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:42,721
and to really see what he'd done was an
pastiche of ideas and styles and fabrics

52
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,490
and color.
And it was kind of Laura Engels and

53
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,320
little house on the prairie on crack.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,190
I mean it was a crazy apron dress,
ruffled skirt,

55
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,420
but done in lyrics and Lemay.
So again,

56
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,040
mark pushes the boundaries.
He pushes the,

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,560
he dares to mixed fabrics and colors and
silhouettes and probably because he just

58
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,090
doesn't care that he's free to do what
he wants and he never repeats himself.

59
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,950
Um,
he's got favorite things that he does.

60
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,140
There's always a somewhere,
a seller all influenced,

61
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:17,450
I would say,
but clearly done a mark.

62
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,570
Um,
he likes to push people,

63
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,580
he likes to shake it all up,
you know,

64
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:25,600
he was a famous famous for his grunge
collection in the early nineties and he

65
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,050
continues to really rock our world,
but it's great and this show was

66
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,090
vibrant,
colorful,

67
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,010
collectic,
a real mix,

68
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:37,300
kept everybody on their toes yet again,
and is Marc by Marc Jacobs collection,

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
which is his younger line was just as
delightful and enchanting and if I was,

70
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,340
you know,
18 to 25 and that was sort of my

71
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,560
demographic and,
and my age group,

72
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,360
I would be around running,
running,

73
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,590
running to those two stores,
into those boutiques to get those

74
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:53,860
clothes.

75
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,490
So he really gets you excited and really
makes you want to buy clothes.

76
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,830
He makes you want the handbags.
Fantastic.

77
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,030
Everyone said the it bag is over,
nobody needs groovy bags anymore.

78
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,470
That's all passe.
Forget it.

79
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,910
Mark has just made us all realize that
there is another bag and he had about

80
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,530
five that were expect macular,
um,

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,880
in his bark collection.
So I think New York is glad to have

82
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,460
mark.
I'm certainly personally,

83
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,660
professionally happy to have him.
He makes it exciting,

84
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,540
he's on a level with the best designers
in Europe,

85
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,900
particularly Paris as well as Miuccia
Prada in Milan,

86
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,530
and really keeping fashion exciting and
interesting and pushing it forward.

87
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,490
You know,
I admire Anna winter so much because,

88
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,500
um,
because of her unbelievable power and,

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,670
and because she does a fantastic job at
vogue,

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,840
but particularly in this question
because she really tries to promote and

91
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:52,460
spent a large portion of her time and
vogue's time and effort to promote the

92
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:56,420
next generation.
It's just really hard business to be

93
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,530
that competitive in,
you know,

94
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:01,850
these guys are coming up with four to
six collections a year.

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,630
That creative process is unbelievably
challenging.

96
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,980
I mean,
think about an artist that has to come

97
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:10,100
up with a whole of four to six times a
year.

98
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:10,940
I mean,
they just don't,

99
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,430
you know,
they,

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,680
they do the same thing.
They moved,

101
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,780
they evolve over time,
over a decade,

102
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:20,810
over five years.
These guys are asked to kind of reinvent

103
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:25,010
the wheel as well as learning their
trade and trying to have viable

104
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:25,520
businesses.

105
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,920
So it's really hard,
I think,

106
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:32,360
for the young generation to come forward
to push forward some of the kinds of new

107
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,400
up and comers that have been around
several seasons.

108
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm disappointed to say that they
faltered a little bit.

109
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,810
They're not able to keep going with the
kind of expectation that we all put on

110
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,220
them.
Um,

111
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,760
but,
but Anna and the vogue fun and the CFTA,

112
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,730
the council of fashion designers of
America really are trying to support

113
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:54,731
fashion at that starting level to really
give these young designers the support

114
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:59,861
and the financial
cash that they need to continue and also

115
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,420
to sort of offer kind of mentoring
program.

116
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,254
But,
um,

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,360
no,
as far as New York is concerned,

118
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,840
that's why it's not been a kind of
season of newness,

119
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,560
but London,
um,

120
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,750
which is happening as we speak right now
is and continues to be a real

121
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,610
interesting place where all those free
ideas and kind of crazy eccentric things

122
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,310
that the English are known for are able
to come out and have created

123
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,540
unbelievable talent.
So,

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
um,
I think London is really the place where

125
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:31,160
you watch it the next best generation of
designers.
