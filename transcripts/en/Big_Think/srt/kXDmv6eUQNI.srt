1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,560
I believe in democracy and liberty that
you can not,

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,840
you can not talk in the name of any
people without elections.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,490
And you cannot supervise the people in
that says,

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,451
Eh,
you,

5
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:26,350
I am not in.
Nobody has the roid eh,

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,790
to,
to say what is good and bad for the

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,110
Egyptian people.
They must,

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,210
uh,
truth for themselves.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,920
Uh,
that is a very,

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,930
very strong idea in the west.
That free elections means in the other

11
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,420
boards.
Phonetics in public.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,720
And this is not true in Egypt is not
true.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,220
First.
Second,

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,430
I think that we must respect the choice
of the people.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,070
And third,
Egypt has,

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,960
uh,
its first democratic,

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,640
uh,
experience,

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,320
uh,
in the,

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,120
about that in the 19th century.
So I mean,

20
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:06,320
we are not beginning from zero.
We have our own experience.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,810
And as you say,
you have,

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,390
uh,
it's,

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,920
it's at risk that you'll have terrible
people coming be,

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,730
could be elected any moment there.

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,730
But what is very important is how to be
able to defend the who own a democratic

26
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:22,910
procedure.
And the,

27
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:24,650
this,
this could be done easily.

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,390
Uh,
so I see no point are to support Arab

29
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,600
dictators.
You see and claiming that,

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,420
uh,
they are the only choice because,

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,150
and I would say even a,
the country,

32
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:41,840
I would say that because of the Arab
dictators,

33
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,330
we are having much more,
uh,

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,210
people going to becoming phonetics
everyday because,

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,690
uh,
the WHO would that be?

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,080
The young generations are not,
uh,

37
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,590
allowed to express themselves
politically because the dictatorship

38
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:01,220
means a total failure in,
in every domain.

39
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:06,221
So you'll have more and more desperate
people who could be a turning to a

40
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,730
phonetic people at any moment.
So I think that,

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,180
that the real solution for the whole
outer world is a year at the moment.
