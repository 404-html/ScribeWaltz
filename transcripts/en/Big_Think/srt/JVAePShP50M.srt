1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,450
A code of ethics doesn't solve.
It might be a guide,

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,570
but at the end of the day,
individuals have to make their own

3
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:22,720
ethical decisions every time they face a
question in a quandary.

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,050
I've had have had editors who have stood
by me and defended me when I pissed off

5
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,280
somebody in the company,
and I've also have editors who come

6
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,061
after me and said,
oh,

7
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:35,370
you can't do that because it's going to
piss off somebody and no code was going

8
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:40,371
to deal with that.
I think that I've learned new ethics in

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,530
the blog world.
I line,

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,680
that's not to say that they're better.
That's not to say that I rejected the

11
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,480
ethics of journalism than I learned
before.

12
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,710
I don't.
I teach them,

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,660
but I've learned an ethic of
transparency online and my blog now,

14
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,520
I tell you the stock I owned,
who I vote for,

15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,920
and all kinds of things,
things that I wouldn't have done back in

16
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:58,780
the days when I was a full time
reporter,

17
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,190
but I think are very important now.

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,750
So I've learned an ethic of
transparency.

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,840
I've learned a new ethic of the
correction on blogs.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,910
If we make a mistake,
we don't erase it.

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,680
We cross it out,
we fess up,

22
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,380
we admitted was there,
and if we don't do that very quickly,

23
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:14,950
we're going to lose credibility.
I've learned an ethic of openness and

24
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,200
collaboration.
When I'm working on a story,

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,770
I'm working on an idea.
I asked my readers to help me and they

26
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:22,720
are very generous.
If I just ask,

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,770
those are new ethics that I've learned
online that I think old media can learn

28
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:28,180
from.
At the same time,

29
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:31,510
there are ethics of the old world that
live forever,

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,610
that are immutable,
a fairness,

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,120
accuracy of balance,
not objectivity,

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,020
but I think those are things that we can
do a better job of helping to teach from

33
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:42,520
old media for our experience.
