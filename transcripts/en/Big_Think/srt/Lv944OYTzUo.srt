1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,450
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,610
in terms of associates who've been
differed from their law firm jobs,

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,050
uh,
I think that,

4
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:16,700
well,
I guess I would say a couple of things.

5
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,700
First be patient.
You will start eventually,

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,870
hopefully.
Uh,

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,600
there had been a couple of cases of law
firms that,

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,140
that told associates who thought they
had jobs will actually you no longer

9
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:30,650
have a job,
but most firms seem to be honoring that

10
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:31,970
commitment.
Um,

11
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:36,380
the second thing I would say is a focus
on developing your professional skills.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,250
So if you are working in a public
interest organization for that time,

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,520
really take the ball and run with it,
see what kind of responsibilities you

14
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,200
can get.
You might be able to get more

15
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:49,910
responsibilities during the public
interest year that you are awaiting out

16
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:54,020
waiting to start for the law firm than
you will as a junior associate at a law

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:54,320
firm.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,410
So the second thing I would say is
really try to make the most of your

19
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:00,050
time.
And the third thing I would say is enjoy

20
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,810
your time.
You will have a lifetime to work and if

21
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:06,350
you want to work at a firm and a,
you could work for decades,

22
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,600
you know,
if you make partner or if you moved to

23
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,450
another firm,
if you don't make partner,

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,060
you could work at a law firm.
And one thing that's nice about lawyers

25
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:17,840
is it is a very,
it is a mental discipline.

26
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,520
Granted there are physical demands as
well,

27
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:23,730
but it's not like were baseball players.
We can work into our sixties,

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,440
into our seventies so you will have your
whole life to work and if you are

29
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:31,490
deferred right now and you are either at
your leisure or if you're working at a

30
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,830
job,
say at a public interest organization

31
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:35,390
with reasonable hours,
enjoy it.

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,330
Have dinner with your wife or husband or
boyfriend or girlfriend.

33
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,090
Go on vacation.
Do the things that you might not be able

34
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:44,960
to do once the economy turns around and
you're at a firm and you're billing

35
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:48,290
2,500 hours a year.
So I guess that will be my advice.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,760
We actually have a series on the blog
called career alternative is where we

37
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,330
focus on,
uh,

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,390
interesting things that people who have
law degrees are doing that don't involve

39
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,520
working at a law firm.
So,

40
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,190
uh,
one thing that's nice about one silver

41
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,650
lining,
I guess to the recession generally as

42
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,630
people are coming up with business
ideas,

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,360
partly because perhaps they lost their
lucrative,

44
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,990
stable job at a big company and now they
have to come up with something else.

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,310
Um,
so we've talked,

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,420
we've talked to lawyers who have started
tutoring and uh,

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,200
admissions consulting businesses,
a lawyer who has started a cupcake

48
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,420
business,
he drives around Manhattan in a truck

49
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,080
selling cupcakes.
We have talked to lawyers who have done

50
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,960
all kinds of things.
There's a lawyer who owns a chain of

51
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,350
subway sandwich stores and a lot of
them,

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,810
even though they're not necessarily
using their legal training,

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,280
we'll talk about how valuable it is to
have that kind of education,

54
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,860
the critical thinking skills,
the communication,

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,760
the ability to look over a contract when
they are trying to launch their

56
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:54,390
businesses.

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,030
These are all things that help.
So granted,

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,740
a law degree is expensive and so if
you're thinking about going to law

59
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,290
school,
I would urge you to think very carefully

60
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,660
about it,
but once you have that degree,

61
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,810
it is quite versatile.
We've looked at lawyers who've gone into

62
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,210
public relations,
who've gone into journalism,

63
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,690
who've gone into finance.
There are a lot of things you can do

64
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,360
with a law degree.
I think it's a great credential to have.

65
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,120
I think it's a great education.
There is just a question of bang for

66
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,940
your buck because there are a lot of
other things that are good to have,

67
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:24,490
but do you want to spend $200,000 for
them?
