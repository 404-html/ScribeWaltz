1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,600
We launched the Parkinson's initiative
with Michael J,

2
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,240
Fox and the Parkinson's institute in out
here,

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,390
and we have individuals with
Parkinson's.

4
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,630
We're given a discounted version of the
23 and me,

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,860
so we've designed the 23 and me site so
that individuals can get access to their

6
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,890
data,
they can fill out surveys specifically

7
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,860
about Parkinson's as well as about their
general health,

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,320
um,
and they get all the other access,

9
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:38,070
so in information about their ancestry,
they can connect and share with

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,020
individuals.
There's a community portion they can

11
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,020
learn from people.
So we want to have a really engaging

12
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:46,410
experience for people so that we can
keep getting information from them.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,860
So we have one Parkinson survey now we
will plan to have additional Parkinson

14
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:55,410
surveys because the longterm goal is how
do I get information about you today,

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
but let's say I want to know how does
your Parkinson's progress in 12 months

16
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:04,320
in 24 months and 48 months because that
information will be really valuable to

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,970
correlate with your genetic information.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,060
So then comes in 23 and we on the back
end,

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,110
our researchers in house are actually
analyzing all the data,

20
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,720
so all the information that we're
collecting through the surveys,

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,170
they then compare with the genetic
information and what we're finding is

22
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,900
we're actually making really interesting
discoveries.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,860
So I'm on all the different questions
that we're asking about.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,030
So we'll hope to announce soon
information about,

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,040
you know,
because as Parkinson's community came

26
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,590
together,
what are some of the discoveries that we

27
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,420
have made and what are those
discoveries,

28
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,580
what kinds of discoveries will benefit
that community.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,510
So that might also integrate with a lot
of the clinical trials that are

30
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,060
happening where clinical trials are
happening,

31
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,950
you know,
either on drugs where we can potentially

32
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:51,570
help figure out why some people respond,
some people don't respond what,

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,100
where there's toxicity or toxicity.
Um,

34
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,580
and some,
a lot of the Parkinson's patients are

35
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,270
eager to participate in clinical trials.
So we might be able to help make sure

36
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,310
that they're,
they can find a clinical trial that

37
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,144
makes sense for them.

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,640
I think the biggest problem in clinical
trials is that they're underpowered and

39
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:14,210
that fundamentally the studies are just
too small and they're designed in such a

40
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,850
way because they're so expensive,
they're designed in such a way that

41
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:20,090
they're just,
there's a small cushion and so,

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,310
you know,
they're expensive to run if you need,

43
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,940
if you need a thousand patients to
really get the clinic the power that

44
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,920
you're looking for,
maybe you have 1100.

45
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,020
Um,
but what we're finding is that those

46
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,860
actually are still under powered.
So the advantage of 23 and me that we

47
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:37,730
can do is we can actually have huge
datasets where we're not looking to

48
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:38,451
collect,
you know,

49
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:42,170
100 people with cancer or a thousand
people with multiple sclerosis.

50
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,450
We want,
you know,

51
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,100
tens of thousands.
So the Parkinson's initiative,

52
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,701
we've announced,
you know,

53
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,310
we have over 3000 people with
Parkinson's in it,

54
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:50,540
which is,
you know,

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,360
on a relative basis,
one of the largest cohorts out there

56
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:53,930
now.

57
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,740
So we're looking to develop these large
cohorts and keep asking questions.

58
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,890
Um,
I think one of the other advantages that

59
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,430
we have is that we can ask these
Parkinson's patients about their

60
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,830
Parkinson's,
but we're also learning about all these

61
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,800
other aspects of them.
So we asked the general health survey

62
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,900
and then we're asking you about commonly
used drugs,

63
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,471
so,
you know,

64
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,930
do they get a stomach ache when they
take advil,

65
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,450
how do they respond to Benadryl,
things like that.

66
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,690
So it's a cohort where we can keep
learning more and more things from them.

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,450
I think we're very focused on
developing,

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,700
um,
or understanding the relationship

69
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,820
between genetics and drug response.
And so that could be either on the

70
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,310
efficacy side or the safety side,
but you know,

71
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,350
there's,
it's a well known studies that have come

72
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,800
out that said 50 percent of all drugs
that we take to have no effect on you.

73
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,910
So what we would like to understand is
if you're given a drug is going to

74
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,580
respond yes or no,
and is it going to be safe,

75
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,740
yes or no?
And that's going to be a critical

76
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:45,860
mission of 23.
And me.
