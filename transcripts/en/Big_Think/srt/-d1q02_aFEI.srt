1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,780
One of the things that came out of my
research,

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,140
if you truly by the idea that this is a
way of thinking about the world,

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,160
like the scientific method,
it's a way of dealing with the world as

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,170
a way of thinking about solving problems
in the world.

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,660
Then you should be able to solve
business problems with it.

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,500
So one of the things I started thinking
about a lot more as I wrote about my

7
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,470
research was how would I take this
logic,

8
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:41,030
this way of reasoning and apply it in a
business setting,

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,980
like in a social setting,
if you will.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,940
So a,
I walked into class one day and I asked

11
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:49,730
people,
why can't I buy futures contracts in

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,800
Rwandan prosperity,
right?

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
So why is it that when we try to solve
something like poverty or a women's

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,670
progress or a education b seemed to
think that we need to use a different

15
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,270
set of tools that business.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,770
So that was one of the questions I had
and I started thinking through,

17
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,770
you know,
how would an expert entrepreneur

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
actually tackled any of those problems?
And I gave you the example of moment

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,680
with you this already,
who is a great example of somebody who

20
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:29,390
take it exactly like a lot of the expert
entrepreneurs that I studied and ended

21
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:33,890
up actually solving a social problem
with surveys to a reasonable extent.

22
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,330
Of course,
it's a lot more work to be done.

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,110
At least he showed the one way to solve
the problem.

24
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:44,111
And for me it's a,
it's kind of a two problems in one in

25
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:49,871
the sense that it also lifts people out
of poverty and it helps women do it.

26
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,280
It empowers women.
So I find that very,

27
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:55,220
very close to my heart,
if you will.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,580
So if you start looking for people who
have solve social problems and in a,

29
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,140
in a reasonably big way,
and you find the same kind of thinking,

30
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,880
then it begs the question,
uh,

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,570
as to why we would not use business
tools,

32
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,120
why would be,
don't use entrepreneurial thinking to

33
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,500
solve some of those problems.

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,950
And that line of thought has led me to
an interesting problem that I want to

35
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,500
this post.
And that is because a lot of

36
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:28,760
entrepreneurs in the social sector think
like entrepreneurs in the for profit

37
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:33,620
sector,
but somehow the funding part of it is so

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,680
different that it makes the social
sector problems very different and

39
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:42,290
difficult.
And so one of the things I want to think

40
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:47,240
about is what would have to change the
way we fund problems in the social

41
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,560
sector,
uh,

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,620
so that entrepreneurial thinking can
actually do the kind of development that

43
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:59,030
has been made possible at the for profit
sector in places like India and China.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,520
So that's one of the questions that I
want to leave people with to think

45
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,910
about.
What would it take to create something

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,950
that is equally valid to all the
different kinds of credit markets and

47
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,150
innovative financial instruments that we
see in the for profit sector.

48
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,280
I know this is a really bad time to talk
about innovative financial instruments,

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
but I also think it's a great time for
that very same reason that the same

50
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,890
innovative a mindset that you have in
the financial secretary.

51
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,310
You could actually take it over to the
social sector.

52
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:38,311
I think something interesting things can
happen and so I do want to give you just

53
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,360
one example or maybe two on that because
close to my heart and you can decide

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,810
what to do with it.
Uh,

55
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,840
one example I have is this company
called Looney Uhh,

56
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,610
which has come up with a venture capital
model for funding education in Latin

57
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,610
America.
Uh,

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,340
another uh,
instrument that I'm looking at is a

59
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,850
fixed income instrument to fund
education in Pakistan.

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,580
As I mentioned,
these are education issues are kind of

61
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,414
close to my heart.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,700
What I want to talk about is the
innovations in funding that are

63
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:20,641
available in the for profit sector that
are not available in the social sector

64
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,390
and not even innovations things that
were innovations once upon a time,

65
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:30,391
but things that we take for granted now
they're just efficient ways of funneling

66
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,450
resources into particular companies and
matching up different investors with

67
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,240
different companies.
For example,

68
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,160
let's think about something like a,
you know,

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,080
more fuel efficient cars,
right?

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,690
So one of the ways,
uh,

71
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:54,691
you think about how do you want to think
about buying a fuel efficient car?

72
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,410
You can check out all the different
models that are there and you can hear

73
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:03,880
people pitch by the electric car is so
much better than the hybrid or uh,

74
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,060
you know,
natural gas would be even better or you

75
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,190
can actually have,
you know,

76
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,270
turn on CNBC or a on CNN or the
technology section or something like

77
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,980
that and you and you can listen to
different people pitch you different

78
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,930
things and then you can take your pick.

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,160
You can spend a little bit more time and
do some more analysis or research if you

80
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,360
want.
And you can say,

81
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:30,280
here's the kind of car I want to buy.
You can also think through which,

82
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,090
which car company you want to invest in
a.

83
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,240
But there's no channel that I can turn
on and here,

84
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,900
you know,
two guys from the Congo say,

85
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,780
uh,
talk to me about how they are going to

86
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,570
solve the illiteracy problem in the
Congo.

87
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,440
And I think through which one do I want
to actually back and go home,

88
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:54,260
do a little bit of research and a couple
of clicks on the computer and I send the

89
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:55,094
money to that.
One.

90
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,540
We never think about social sector
problems in the same way.

91
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,920
That's the kind of thing,
I mean,

92
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,510
and let's say one of those two guys in
the Congo as a really poor way of

93
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:10,220
solving the illiteracy problem in such a
way that the problem's solved.

94
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,730
And uh,
you know,

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,840
it creates a financially self sustaining
model.

96
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,660
Uh,
there's no way we can just simply create

97
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:22,661
a franchise of 1200 of those kinds of
schools that spread all over Africa or

98
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:27,650
we can important to Brazil.
We don't think about social sector

99
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:32,210
problems though that way and we don't
have any of the channels that

100
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:37,211
infrastructure that exists that allow
entrepreneurs to not just build ventures

101
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:43,571
but to grow them and to spread them out
and to create variations through

102
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,100
competition,
things like that.

103
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,390
So I allow a lot of those things and
most of us will recognize those market

104
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,650
mechanisms,
right?

105
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,860
They don't exist in the social world.
It's like really good smart people

106
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,550
reinvent the wheel all the time in the
social sector.

107
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,790
So my question really is that the
essence of entrepreneurial thinking

108
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,370
exists on the side of entrepreneurs
building ventures in the social sector,

109
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,020
but it seems to be very much lacking on
the funding side and that's where I

110
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,830
think I would like to do some work and
some of my colleagues and I are

111
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,010
beginning to work on it and we call
those markets in here.

112
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,740
Would hope.
I just wanted to mention that because I

113
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:32,741
want to leave like a everything that I
have talked about here on a what to do

114
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:38,081
next problem and I think for those of us
interested in innovative ideas in

115
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:44,141
business and especially a,
the logic of entrepreneurs that is going

116
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:45,230
to be,
for me,

117
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:50,231
I think the next frontier to think
through how do we bring entrepreneurial

118
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,940
thinking to the funding side of the
social sector?

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,400
Uh,
lots of good stuff are happening on the

120
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:59,270
ground both on the entrepreneur side
that is a venture building side and the

121
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,850
funding side.
But I think there's a lot of exciting

122
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:05,070
opportunities on the funding side for
entrepreneurs to get in there.

123
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,040
Uh,

124
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,580
would.
