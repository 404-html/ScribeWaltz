1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,450
I think this country is ready for a
black president.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,910
Uh,
not because he's black,

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,930
not because everyone's come to some
great racial understanding,

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,931
but because he is who he is and because
of his character,

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,750
and because he is who he is as an
individual and what he stands for and

6
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:27,090
what he's,
uh,

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,120
and the kind of campaign he has run.
I think America is ready for Barack

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,360
Obama to be president.
I don't know if they would have been

9
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:40,610
ready for another black man to be
president,

10
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,910
but this black man,
I think they're ready for him to be

11
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:43,120
present.
