1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,700
Oh boy,
that's a really tough question is it's

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,910
kind of like asking a what are the,
what are the five countries you should

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,960
know about if you're not interested in
geology or geography or politics?

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,470
Um,
and the answer varies depending on what

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:23,100
your actual interests are or what are
the five companies you should know.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
Uh,
but,

7
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,480
um,
and,

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,710
and the answer changes over time too.
Um,

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,080
uh,
back when I was getting started,

10
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,210
Lo these many decades ago,
uh,

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,620
the answers would have been Fortran,
cobol,

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,600
basic
lists and maybe Apl,

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,880
uh,
and uh,

14
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,480
those were very formative languages back
then and people learned a lot from

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,680
those.
But these days,

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,620
uh,
it might be more important for you to

17
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:56,270
know a Java script,
even if I'm a,

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,890
the only reason you know that is,
is that you know,

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,700
whether or not to click the enabled Java
script button in your browser,

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,560
um,
but javascript is a nice lightweight

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,970
object oriented language.

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,890
Um,
and,

23
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,260
uh,
that's why it can fit in a browser,

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,450
uh,
and,

25
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,160
uh,
do these things such as,

26
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:17,030
uh,
uh,

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,790
run little programs that,
uh,

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,713
that,
uh,

29
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,740
help you input your data.
And then send it off to a web server

30
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,420
somewhere.
Um,

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,480
there are,
there are heavier weight,

32
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,150
a object oriented languages.
Um,

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,040
and uh,
you know,

34
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,750
the elephant in the room is sort of
Java.

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,350
You can't really make a list of modern
languages without talking about it.

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,070
Java is sort of the,
uh,

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,630
the Cobol of the 21st century.
I think it's a kind of heavyweight,

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,110
a verbose.
And uh,

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,230
everyone loves to hate it.
I'm not,

40
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:57,090
everyone will admit that,
but managers kind of like it because,

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,550
um,
it looks like you're getting a lot done.

42
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,280
Um,
you know,

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,800
if 100 lines of Java code,
uh,

44
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,050
accomplish a task,
then it looks like you've written a

45
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,970
hundred lines,
even though in a different language,

46
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:12,240
it might only take five lines,
you know,

47
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:13,021
it's,
it's like,

48
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,130
uh,
you know,

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,120
you can eat a one pound steak or you can
get a,

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,410
you know,
100 pounds of shoe leather and you feel

51
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,570
a greater sense of accomplishment after
the shoe leather.

52
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,403
But,
you know,

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,250
maybe there's some downsides.
Um,

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,740
but it also,
um,

55
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,680
because it is sort of considered an
industrial language and programmers,

56
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:36,681
they're sort of interchangeable parts,
a managers like it for that reason,

57
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,100
and for that reason,
a lot of Java jobs that have been

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,790
outsourced from the United States.
Um,

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,350
oh,
what other languages?

60
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,510
Um,
I think,

61
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,850
uh,
going in a different direction,

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,230
coming more from academia,
we have a language like a Haskell,

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,430
which we call a functional programming
language that means function in a

64
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,530
mathematical sense,
not in the sense of the other language

65
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,670
or other languages are dysfunctional.
Uh,

66
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,160
but a function mathematically has an
input and an output and it maps to,

67
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,740
um,
uh,

68
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,890
you know,
with a great deal of a mathematical

69
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,480
certainty what those,
what those are.

70
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,620
So,
um,

71
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,770
uh,
a

72
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,700
Haskell is one of those languages that a
mathematician type minded people love.

73
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,270
It's,
it's sort of a language for geniuses by

74
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:40,760
Jesus.
Um,

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,370
so you should probably know about it if
only to be able to say,

76
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,140
well,
is this Kinda like Haskell?

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,940
And if so,
then you know,

78
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,230
you have to hire some really smart
people to,

79
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,490
uh,
to program manage A.

80
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,730
Haskell is sort of a modern kind of
lists in that sense.

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Um,
what else?

82
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,980
Uh,
well,

83
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,380
we can't,
we can't leave off modern languages

84
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:10,381
without talking about c,
the c language that's just spelled with

85
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,440
the letter c,
m is actually about 40 years old.

86
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,900
But,
um,

87
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,870
people have tried to replace,
see with other languages that are,

88
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,220
are like it,
and have by and large,

89
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:26,221
not succeeded because a c is a very
minimalistic language and very close to

90
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:31,620
the metal as we say on a,
on a machine and lets you get down and

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,690
do very fine grain stuff very
efficiently.

92
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,340
But it's a lot of hard work.
But once you've done that work,

93
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,450
you can run it pretty much everywhere.
So almost all the other languages that

94
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,700
you see,
a Java,

95
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,110
Perl,
whatever,

96
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,270
uh,
actually if you look down underneath,

97
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,080
they're actually implemented and see or,
or in a closely related language.

98
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,970
So,
um,

99
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,201
uh,
that,

100
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,890
that continues to be a very fundamental
language if only because everyone is

101
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,460
trying to reinvent it and not succeeding
in doing so.

102
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,730
And finally,
um,

103
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,330
for a fifth language a,
well,

104
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,580
you'd probably want to pick one of the
scripting languages.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,390
Um,
there's,

106
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,560
there's several to choose from a,
there's python,

107
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,320
there's Ruby,
but of course I am prejudiced in favor

108
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,580
of Pearl,
uh,

109
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,260
because I think it has the,
um,

110
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,890
the liveliest community.
Um,

111
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,220
and because,
uh,

112
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,310
we,
uh,

113
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,310
have intentionally been redesigning it
lightly to leap frog,

114
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,810
uh,
all the,

115
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,040
uh,
other languages,

116
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,530
uh,
for the,

117
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,190
for the last number of years we've been
redesigning it to take out all the warts

118
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,110
that we've noticed over time.
And we figured it was our one chance to,

119
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
um,
a break,

120
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,540
backward compatibility,
break the things that need breaking,

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,360
keep all the things that make parole
parole,

122
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,810
keep it a joy to use.
And with this make it a language that

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,500
will be able to be useful and enjoyable
for decades.

124
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,600
Um,
and so,

125
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,230
uh,
I,

126
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,330
I'd recommend Pearl,
but I'm known to be prejudiced in the

127
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:09,590
matter.
