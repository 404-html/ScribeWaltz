1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,700
One of the things that I think is
depressed me most about our political

2
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:12,701
system in the last decade or so has been
the incredible partisanship.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,400
There's nothing wrong with people
fighting about issues and having

4
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,220
different views about them and arguing
vigorously for that point of view,

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,760
but opposing a point of view simply
because it's the point of view of the

6
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,080
other party,
right?

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,000
That's bad.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,860
We hold these truths to be self evident.
All men are created equal.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,010
I think you're going down by their
creator,

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,800
certain money
leaving their America and they have a

11
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,154
lot of money.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,330
That was on my values.
Moral values.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,000
We don't have to do anything but look
right there and so yeah,

14
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,950
for tomorrow's have dropped in this
country,

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,020
dewey,
you can actually see Russia from land

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,430
here in Alaska.
You cannot go to a seven 11 or a Dunkin

17
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:20,440
donuts unless you have a slight Indian
accent.

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,680
We're headed towards 2030 years of
incredible chaos and turmoil.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,393
Yeah.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,910
On Iraq,
on the economy,

21
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:40,100
on healthcare,
on a global warming.

22
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,280
There's no real issue where the parties
are grieving and the distinctions are

23
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:44,114
huge.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,270
These are the people that are connected
with the Barack Obama

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,760
needs to return to Illinois and the
Senate and get some experience and get

26
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,060
out and live in the real world for a few
years and get out of that elitist

27
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:15,110
conclave.
They called Barack Obama and elitist and

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,940
they pretended to Republicans on their
assigned sending mckeen.

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,290
Her heart warming story when she was a
kid is she helped her dad pick out a

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,660
several hundred thousand dollars
fountain in front of their mansion.

31
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,950
John Mccain spurned one establishment,
but ended up ironically embracing the

32
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:33,140
other,
which is the cultural conservatives.

33
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:36,260
No question about it.
I think the Republican Party understands

34
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,570
better what's in the Bible than the
Democratic Party.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,170
They demonstrate it.
Metro.

36
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,610
Yes.
There's no reason to kill an unborn

37
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,140
baby.
God wouldn't want that.

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,100
Republicans wouldn't want that.
And Democrats want that.

39
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,080
Um,
it seems like it is

40
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,890
John Mccain.
Like he's a real guy.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,300
You know,
he's had a real life.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Don't think he eats a ruble.
I seen him do hot dogs and hamburgers.

43
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,710
This is the Huffington Post,
always as loud.

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,080
This is a chocolate smoothie buddy.
Healthy chocolate got so I know any raw,

45
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,250
organic,
fair trade,

46
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:17,251
Cacao powder,
everything that's happening out in the

47
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:20,060
world today is happening because there's
a sense of it's us against them.

48
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,660
This sense of other myths.
You guys under our tech and you're

49
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,730
responding with kindness.
It doesn't work.

50
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,470
I mean,
you were in the heat of a battle to win

51
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,000
this race.
A bubble.

52
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,760
Obama needs a sword and a shield.
The Shield,

53
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:35,740
which is secondary,
is to fend off with vigor and strength

54
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,810
the attacks,
but the most important thing is the sore

55
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,060
stand up,
stand up,

56
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,253
stand up.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,390
Merck is based on ideas.
We have enough intelligence.

58
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:08,990
No to remove radical poverty in all
parts of the world.

59
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,930
Or the trick for the future is to find
ways to recreate what used to be called

60
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,480
the vital center.
One question that I think it's always

61
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:19,290
useful to ask is,
if I am so sure I'm right,

62
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,960
how come she social?
She's right too.

63
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,480
There's always the possibility to make
change.

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,470
Good

65
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,140
big part of democracy is being the
leader yourself.
