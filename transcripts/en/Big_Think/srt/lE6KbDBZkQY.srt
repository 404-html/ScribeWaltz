1
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,290
Stop worrying,
don't learn to live,

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,120
to love the bomb,
but stop worrying.

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,270
First of all,
Iran is so far away from having a

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,530
nuclear weapon.
Um,

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,430
I know there's all this reports,
these alarmist reports.

6
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,270
Iran has enough.
You rich uranium to build a bomb

7
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,440
tomorrow.
Well,

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,110
building a bomb is not as simple as it
sounds.

9
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,970
Yes,
the designs are on the Internet and you

10
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,180
can.
But to actually create a nuclear weapon

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,780
is going to be so difficult for Iran to
do quietly.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm secretly,
yes,

13
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,740
they have.
They've enriched uranium to three

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:46,260
percent or four percent.
Whatever the number is that is useful

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,520
for as fuel to then enrich it to 90
whatever percent they would have to.

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,030
I mean it would have to be done under
the watchful eyes of the IAEA,

17
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,680
so we would know about it the minute
they do it,

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,310
it's not like they have this other
secret facility or at least even the

19
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:02,280
IAEA doesn't think they have the secret
facility where they're doing exactly

20
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,630
what they're doing in front of the IAEA
and they can then secretly go out and in

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,830
and enrich to a higher level.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,280
So once you've enriched it to a higher
level,

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,220
surely you'd want to test a nuclear
weapon before you just fired it off.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,120
I mean,
it runs so far away from testing and

25
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,540
nuclear weapons.
So we wouldn't even know know the North

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,700
Koreans tested weapons and we don't,
we're not even sure that they worked.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Um,
we do know that Israel has nuclear

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,890
weapons.
We do know they have a delivery system

29
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,020
for those nuclear weapons.
They have the kinds of missiles that

30
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,860
could deliver accurate missiles that
could deliver nuclear weapons to Iran.

31
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,250
Iran is so far away from having that
ability.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,080
Um,
some would say,

33
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,670
oh,
you're being naive.

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,620
They could do it in a year.
They could do it in two years.

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,700
But to be so many signals before that
happened that we could get,

36
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,170
we could become really alarmed if Iran
suddenly shuts down the IAEA cameras 24

37
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,790
hours a day on their facility where it's
using the riskier.

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,520
They shut down those cameras.
You can say,

39
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,320
okay,
that's the beginning of a cause of

40
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:57,450
alarm.
What are they doing that they want to

41
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,790
get rid of the IAEA inspectors?
So I mean,

42
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,970
we're so far away from that.
I think that we should let the AIAA do

43
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:05,970
their job.
We should at least talk to the Iranians.

44
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,740
I mean,
the thing is that they have the

45
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,010
technology to enrich uranium.
You're not going to bomb that technology

46
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,560
out of them.
There's plenty of people in Iran who can

47
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:17,460
start up a centrifuge program,
even if this program was completely

48
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,860
eliminated.
So the question now becomes,

49
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,010
how do we incentivize the Iranians to
never take that step?

50
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,060
We know that they have the knowledge to
build centrifuges,

51
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,880
to enrich uranium,
and a lot of people analyst will tell

52
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:31,230
you,
nuclear scientists will say it's not a

53
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,670
big step to then go to a bomb.

54
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,050
It is actually a bigger step than we
think because you have to test it.

55
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,900
You have to create that perfect sphere.
You have to have the mechanism,

56
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,730
you have to have the delivery system to
deliver it.

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,460
Presumably you want a second strike
capability,

58
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:47,370
not just a first strike capability,
because a first strike capability,

59
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:49,800
if somebody has a second strike on you,
you're done.

60
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,190
So you want to have this that to be an
equal in terms of nuclear power with

61
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:59,770
Israel for example.
So how do we incentivize them to not

62
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,860
take that step and that's where
negotiations come in because there are

63
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,630
plenty of countries that do have that
ability to.

64
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,180
Japan is one,
they're never incentivized to go and

65
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:08,140
build a bomb.
Brazil,

66
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:10,600
South Africa,
these are countries that have the

67
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,990
ability to enrich uranium,
have the ability to even probably build

68
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,870
a bomb if they want it to.
But what stops them from doing it?

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,520
Well,
there's,

70
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,350
they'd have no,
they have no incentive.

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,930
None whatsoever.
They have all the disincentives to build

72
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,000
a bomb.
So what we have to do is figure out

73
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,610
what,
how to disincentivize Iran from ever

74
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,180
taking that step.
