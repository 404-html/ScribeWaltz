1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,570
In 2014 I announced one of my boldest
companies.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,970
It's a company called Human Longevity
Inc.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,730
Uh,
Co founded it with Craig Venter,

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:10,500
the first guy sequenced the human
genome.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,510
Uh,
and Bob Hariri,

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,230
one of the top stem cell scientists and
businessmen in the world.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,830
And we founded human longevity
incorporated as a means to extend the

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,350
healthy human lifespan to make a hundred
years old.

9
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,020
And you're 60.
And in the first year of operations,

10
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:31,380
we built the largest genome sequencing
facility in the world.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,930
Uh,
and that genome sequencing facility

12
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,480
besides your genome,
uh,

13
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:40,380
the 3.2 billion letters from your father
and the 3.2 billion letters from your

14
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,770
mother,
we are also sequencing your microbiome.

15
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,210
You are a collection of 10 trillion
human cells and a hundred trillion

16
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,520
bacterial cells.
But besides that,

17
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,590
you're full phenotype,
your,

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,970
uh,
your Mri,

19
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,530
the full imaging of your body,
your Metabolome,

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,400
the 2,400 chemicals in your bloodstream.
All of this data is being collected.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,400
And then we're using machine learning to
mine that data for the secrets of what

22
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,810
drives cancer,
what drives heart disease,

23
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:14,430
what drives neurodegenerative disease.
With a mission of making sure that when

24
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,140
you're a hundred,
you look good,

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,180
you move good,
you think good,

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,490
you feel great.
And uh,

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,520
I think that's where we're going.
Our ability to rapidly sequence a

28
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:28,980
genome,
take what was $100 million and nine

29
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,610
months down to 1000 bucks in a few
hours,

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,900
is going to unlock the secrets.
We are the product of our genome.

31
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,910
How you look,
how you sound,

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,580
the structures of your brain are all
coded for in our genes.

33
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:45,450
So as we unlock this,
we're going to create tremendous

34
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:48,810
breakthroughs in the healthy human
lifespan.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,810
Inventing new drugs that are
personalized to you.

36
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,420
It's going to reinvent health on an epic
scale.
