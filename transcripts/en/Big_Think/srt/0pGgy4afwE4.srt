1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,213
I'm Rick Perlstein,
I'm the author of Nixon's land problem 

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,070
with Obama's postcards and agenda is 
that he came into it,

3
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:19,350
he came into his presidency,
uh,

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,393
at a time when millions of Americans,
perhaps even tens of millions of 

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,780
Americans don't consider a Democrat 
president legitimate,

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,913
don't get sued or liberalism legitimate,
don't consider the idea of the state 

7
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:36,330
farm new programs to help people 
legitimate.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,730
Uh,
so he's in a situation a lot like,

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,620
you know,
April Abraham Lincoln face in 18,

10
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,454
60 when you had millions of Americans 
who didn't even consider what was going 

11
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,190
on in Washington to have anything to do 
with them.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,610
So the big question for me was always 
was this post partisan idea,

13
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:53,604
this idea that you could kind of bring 
adversaries across the table and get 

14
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:57,654
them to agree to each other and agree 
with to get them to agree with each 

15
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,700
other and,
uh,

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,310
achieve social progress.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,500
Was that a deep seated belief of his or 
was that in a certain sense,

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,480
a tactic?
Not a cynical tactic,

19
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,314
but a tactic and a,
I would be very with him if it were a 

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,300
way of thinking about politics.
If the war,

21
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,143
a tactic,
because the job of a transformative 

22
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,464
leader is not too huge the center,
but to define their own values as the 

23
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,870
center as common sense.
And uh,

24
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,860
if he,
you know,

25
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,600
I,
I believe in the agenda he's passed,

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,800
he's,
he's putting far,

27
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,400
for example,
universal healthcare,

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,763
for example,
a cap and trade and green jobs as a way 

29
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,190
to solve our energy problems while 
growing the economy.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,520
I think these are reasonable a while 
liberal goals and uh,

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,433
if he presents them as reasonable and 
the reaction to them as one could knew 

32
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,374
they were going to be because there are 
these millions of people that don't 

33
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,190
consider a liberal president.

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,430
Legitimate was irrational extreme that 
presented him an opportunity to say,

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,013
my program is rational,
but my opposition has chosen extremism 

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,633
has chosen on reason and be willing to 
take the hit that there's always going 

37
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,990
to be a minority of the country.
Thirty percent,

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,273
35 percent,
even 40 percent who disagrees with him 

39
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,774
radically disagrees with him strongly.
But if he's still willing to pass his 

40
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:39,684
program with that 60 percent margin,
the rest of the country will eventually 

41
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:44,574
catch up.
The reaction notice will understand as 

42
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:51,630
they did with social security,
as they did with women getting the vote,

43
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,510
freeing the slaves,
you know,

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,860
social security that actually these 
things were in their interests.

45
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,020
They'll accept them as part of the 
established order of American society.

46
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,010
And in fact,
20,

47
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,110
30,
40 years years down the road,

48
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,183
the Republicans and the Conservatives 
will be campaigning to save universal 

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,263
healthcare,
just like a campaign to save social 

50
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:14,074
security.

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
But the problem is this doesn't really 
work unless you make this kind of 

52
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,724
tactical shift.
If people say that you're illegitimate 

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,530
and your liberal agenda is extremist 
socialist,

54
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,623
uh,
destroying the America that we all grew 

55
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,584
up with,
you have to be willing to say this is 

56
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,670
unreasonable.
This is extreme.

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,330
And if you aren't able to say this is 
unreasonable and this is extreme,

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
then you're granting your opposition a 
undue influence.

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,800
You're basically negotiating with the UN
negotiator bubble.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
And,
uh,

61
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,130
as Abraham Lincoln said quite eloquently
in his 18,

62
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,130
60 speech at Cooper Union,
uh,

63
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,780
you can't win that way.

64
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,090
I've been saying for years that,
you know,

65
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,360
there are millions of Americans who 
basically don't consider,

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
uh,
the liberal project legitimate.

67
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,990
They consider it the opposite of what 
America means to them and,

68
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,883
uh,
that they derive their identity from 

69
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:22,561
questioning the legitimacy and the 
ability of liberal government to,

70
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,390
to function peacefully.
So,

71
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,430
uh,
I think that for a couple months,

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,750
uh,
even more maybe six months,

73
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,020
uh,
Barack Obama's charisma and his,

74
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,900
um,
his remarkable popularity,

75
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,053
a kind of stunned,
some of these people into silence think 

76
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,050
people couldn't quite believe what 
they're saying.

77
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,610
But if you,
if you,

78
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,290
if you,
if you look at it historically,

79
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:52,291
it's quite continuous with what happened
when Bill Clinton became president.

80
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,613
You know,
when you began to hear people accusing 

81
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,930
him of murdering his aids.
You know,

82
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,440
when you began to have,
uh,

83
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,300
people,
uh,

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,260
saying that he was actually a agent for 
the Soviet Union,

85
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,920
which he had visited when he was a child
or when he was a teenager when he was in

86
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,754
college.

87
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,050
And you saw the same thing when Jimmy 
Carter became president and,

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,910
uh,
you know,

89
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,763
um,
he was immediately considered a part of 

90
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,434
this,
uh,

91
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,140
corrupt Democratic Party establishment.
Uh,

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,450
it happened every time a Democrat was 
elected and it will happen.

93
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:33,160
Every time a Democrat is elected,
it's part of our patrimony as Americans.

94
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,353
And the challenge for a Barack Obama or 
any democrat or any liberal is to 

95
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:44,320
understand that this is just part of who
we are as Americans to acknowledge it,

96
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,260
to respect it,
and to transcend it.

97
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,970
And,
uh,

98
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,260
you know,
the lion can lay down with the lamb,

99
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,450
but it's not going to last for very 
long.

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,140
Well,
tactically the,

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
the threat of,
by conservatives,

102
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,314
by social conservatives,
by the conservative movement as they 

103
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,160
call themselves,
based in Washington,

104
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,190
based in,
you know,

105
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,280
uh,
places like northern Virginia,

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,760
uh,
to form a new party has always been this

107
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,640
kind of bluff designed to,
uh,

108
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,890
you know,
bend the Republican Party to their will.

109
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,590
And uh,
you know,

110
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,190
it's,
it's,

111
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,580
it's usually worked because the media 
reports it seriously except for,

112
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,290
in the American context,
you know,

113
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:31,070
third parties very rarely work.
We have a winner take all system,

114
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,500
so you know,
the minute,

115
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,850
say wichard Viguerie who threatens to 
create a third party,

116
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,684
you know,
every four or eight years because he 

117
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,410
claims that the conservatives in power 
aren't really conservative.

118
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,100
If he really did it,
he would immediately be surrendering all

119
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:47,840
his influence in national discussions.
So that's not really a serious threat.

120
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,870
Um,
the division between,

121
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,480
let's say a corporate conservatives and 
religious conservatives is fascinating,

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,990
interesting,
rich and complex.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,213
I mean,
one of the ways it worked was that 

124
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,570
traditionally not traditionally,
basically,

125
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,404
one of the ways that evolved in the 19 
seventies was that people who wanted a 

126
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,160
business who wanted a more laissez 
faire,

127
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,120
less regulation,
more control over government,

128
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,140
more of say a cronyism stake and what 
government was actually doing,

129
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,980
um,
saw things like the Heritage Foundation,

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,233
the Christian coalition,
the moral majority as opportunities for 

131
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,440
them to form a coalition.
Um,

132
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,490
if you give it a generous interpretation
or aggrandized their power,

133
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,800
if you give it a little more cynical 
interpretation.

134
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,400
So you get these fascinating moments 
like this.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,460
A war in West Virginia in 1974 by 
religious conservatives to,

136
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,013
uh,
to kick a heathen textbooks out of the 

137
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:54,590
schools that were sort of supposedly 
imposed by religious bureaucrats.

138
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,170
It was a very local issue.
It was a very localized,

139
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:59,240
struggled.
It had a lot to do with the way politics

140
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,074
works in West Virginia where you have 
this kind of history of insurgent 

141
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:04,670
violence from coal miners.

142
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,803
Um,
and you get these conservative business 

143
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,244
conservatives in Washington at the 
Heritage Foundation realizing that this 

144
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,043
is an organizing opportunity for them.
The Heritage Foundation sends 

145
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:22,331
representatives down to West Virginia 
and helps put these people in touch with

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,803
national ideological,
large entrepreneurs with people like 

147
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,014
Richard Viguerie.
And that's how a coalition forms that 

148
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:30,734
basically creates foot soldiers for an 
agenda that the West Virginia religious 

149
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,540
conservatives may or may not be 
supporting,

150
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,180
but eventually they'll come to support.
Um,

151
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,390
and uh,
it's,

152
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,010
there's,
there's,

153
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,670
there's both an inherent tension and 
instability in it,

154
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,340
but there's also within American 
protestantism,

155
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,250
a real strain of pro capitalism.
And so it's,

156
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:56,580
you know,
it's,

157
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:56,940
it's,
it's,

158
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,160
it's interesting,
it's rich,

159
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,930
it's tense.
Sometimes it works,

160
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,100
sometimes it doesn't work,
it's,

161
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,830
and right now we're,
you know,

162
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,500
at a real knife's edge about whether 
it's going to work or whether it's going

163
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:07,334
to fall apart.

164
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,053
The CEO of a say in Aerospace 
Corporation might not want to have 

165
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:18,630
anything to do with a demonic 
possession,

166
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,770
you know,
uh,

167
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,970
in pentecostal churches,
um,

168
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,930
but you know,
he needs the people who have those great

169
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,050
passions in order to kind of anchor the 
conservative coalition.

170
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,843
So the question is,
when have they created a Frankenstein's 

171
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,140
monster whenever they created something 
that,

172
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,520
uh,
they can't control.

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,700
You're seeing more and more indications,
a buy from conservatives have,

174
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,540
you know,
that kind of embarrassment.

175
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,140
And I was out the other night and a West
Point Grad,

176
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,750
a banker friend,
uh,

177
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,873
who's a conservative,
he called himself the country club 

178
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:50,844
conservative and said,
I have nothing to do with those Sarah 

179
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,460
Pailin people.
Well,

180
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,410
the problem is,
without those Sarah Pailin people,

181
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,270
the Republicans would never win an 
election.

182
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,050
So,
you know,

183
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,070
they find themselves on the horns of a 
dilemma.

184
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,400
And,
uh,

185
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:08,401
the ideological entrepreneurs on the 
religious right who,

186
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,940
you know,
uh,

187
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,093
let's face it,
have an interest in a grandizing their 

188
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,340
power and their control,
uh,

189
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,980
don't really have any incentive to,
um,

190
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,630
to modify or moderate their positions.

191
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,570
In fact,
they're more likely to aggrandized their

192
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,790
power and their influence by,
uh,

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,940
by maintaining a front of purity.
So you know that,

194
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:33,774
that,
that speaks to the whole tension and 

195
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,850
paradox behind the conservative project 
right now,

196
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:39,684
all the people who have ascended to 
positions of power and leadership in 

197
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:43,644
rush lumbar is a perfect example,
even though he pretty much unites the 

198
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,750
religious and a business,
conservatives pretty seamlessly,

199
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,170
um,
have achieved their influence,

200
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,423
have achieved their power through a 
certain kind of cultural style based on 

201
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,420
their willingness to say that compromise
is inherently bad.

202
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,973
And that gets back to the question of 
whether Obama can negotiate with the 20 

203
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,783
million people who listened to rush 
limbaugh everyday and consider any 

204
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:14,814
compromise,
compromise a betrayal of America's 

205
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,560
promise itself.
Right?

206
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,423
So there's no incentive for a rush 
limbaugh to change because this is 

207
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,630
what's given him this,
you know,

208
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,340
these 20 million listeners,
you know,

209
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,870
his,
his mansion that has a,

210
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,704
you know,
a replica of the hall of mirrors at 

211
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,250
Versailles.
So when,

212
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,180
um,
you know,

213
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:34,014
uh,
the Republican National Committee or a 

214
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,403
train of a conservative Republicans who 
wish to moderate the image of their 

215
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:45,780
party to make it seem more centrist and 
palatable to swing voters,

216
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,614
try and do that,
rush limbaugh is able to not merely 

217
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,670
survive but thrive by disdaining them.

218
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,863
Healthcare is a fascinating example of 
this question of how religious 

219
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,560
conservatives and business conservatives
can act in coalition.

220
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,790
You know,
I'm being on the,

221
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,491
uh,
the,

222
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:12,550
the,
the mailing list of,

223
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,280
uh,
you know,

224
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,030
the American Family Association,
Don Wildman Organization.

225
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm beginning to get the emails saying 
that know healthcare.

226
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,790
Uh,
they,

227
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,590
that,
you know,

228
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,460
basically national national healthcare 
program is imposition on Christians.

229
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,920
You know,
it's going to do a fund abortions.

230
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,023
It's going to have a,
violate the sanctity of the traditional 

231
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:35,344
family.
So you see a pure example of kind of a 

232
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,080
right wing libertarian business,
conservatives,

233
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,250
uh,
using,

234
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,473
uh,
the leaders of the religious right in a 

235
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,580
quite an effective way,
uh,

236
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,503
to,
you know,

237
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,290
undermine a mass constituency for 
reform,

238
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,620
which in the end is actually quite 
conservative.

239
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:57,550
I mean,
what could be more,

240
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,760
you know,
uh,

241
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,360
what,
what could be more judicious then,

242
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,230
you know,
like I said,

243
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,870
letting people change their jobs,
uh,

244
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,793
if they have an entrepreneurial idea,
what could be more strengthening of the 

245
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:13,210
traditional bonds of family and society,
then families not going bankrupt because

246
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,710
someone in the family gets sick.

247
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,391
Um,
but,

248
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,980
um,
you know,

249
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,940
there are very powerful interests,
uh,

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,860
who,
uh,

251
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,103
you know,
basically benefit from the status quo 

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,350
and they're able to take advantage of 
this preexisting,

253
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,650
a deep distrust,
a that's,

254
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:33,484
you know,
very American of anything having to do 

255
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,420
with an expanding state.
And again,

256
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:41,920
historically it's the same thing you saw
was social security.

257
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
It's the same thing you saw with 
Medicare.

258
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,143
It's the same thing you saw with the 
idea that the United States in the 19th 

259
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,550
century should have a central bank.
You know,

260
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:55,720
the same thing you saw when the 
government began talking about financing

261
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,540
internal improvements like canals,
uh,

262
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,040
the interstates,
you know,

263
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,380
which were seen as a communist plot by 
some people.

264
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,290
Uh,
so,

265
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,890
um,
the challenge for progressives,

266
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,380
the challenge for people who believe 
that this is,

267
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,840
uh,
not only,

268
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,160
uh,
uh,

269
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,170
an important goal,
but an imperative goal.

270
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,843
National healthcare is a not to imagine 
that this kind of irrational fear is 

271
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:25,894
going to go away,
but simply to both through it forced 

272
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,910
healthcare down people's throats,
whether they,

273
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,060
whether they like it or not,
and watch what happens 10,

274
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:34,751
20,
30,

275
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,620
40 years from now when again,
conservatives come to power,

276
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,780
promising to,
uh,

277
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,280
to uphold the ideals of a Obama's 
healthcare program.

278
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,383
Just like George Bush promised to uphold
social security and promised to honor 

279
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,700
Fdr.
And,

280
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
uh,
just like,

281
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,360
uh,
conservatives have any gender,

282
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,600
every generation or I should say 
reactionaries advantage.

283
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,680
Every generation say,
well,

284
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,550
the liberals that we're dealing with now
are unacceptable extremists.

285
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,663
Uh,
the ones we had last generation weren't 

286
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:07,844
so bad.

287
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,603
I don't see it over the horizon.
And Reagan is a perfect example of 

288
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:17,450
someone who simultaneously,
you know,

289
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:22,451
kind of honored the impulses of this 
grassroots,

290
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,654
right,
but also kind of massage them and also 

291
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,790
treated them like a politician,
treats a member of it's coalition,

292
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,510
like Franklin Roosevelt treated the 
unions are Lyndon Johnson,

293
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,531
you know,
treated,

294
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,364
uh,
the civil rights movement and the 

295
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,493
consumer rights movement.
Ronald Reagan was able to basically 

296
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,540
massage the concerns of the pro life 
movement without ever giving a speech to

297
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:49,541
them without ever granting them any 
major policy concessions while able to,

298
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,080
you know,
being able to,

299
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,160
um,
place,

300
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,073
uh,
their acolytes in positions of relative 

301
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,860
powerlessness,
powerlessness,

302
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,480
symbolic positions,
you know,

303
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:03,380
things like smaller ambassadorships,
independent government commissions.

304
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,150
And,
uh,

305
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,650
with his criticism and skill,
he was able to,

306
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,533
uh,
mitigate the kinds of tensions that 

307
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,550
created.
And there were tensions,

308
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,870
you know,
early in the eighties,

309
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,740
George will was one,
Richard Viguerie was another.

310
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,813
There were a lot of conservatives saying
that Ronald Reagan is betraying 

311
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,024
conservatism,
which tend to happens whenever a 

312
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,760
conservative president is politically 
unsuccessful.

313
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,090
Conservatism never fails.
It is only failed.

314
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,290
They'll say that,
uh,

315
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,124
Ronald Reagan or George Bush.
It fails because they're not 

316
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,444
conservative and that sentiment lasts 
for as long as they're politically 

317
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,050
unsuccessful.
But George Bush,

318
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:45,884
it's,
you know,

319
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,110
every other day you hear a conservative 
say,

320
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:48,944
well,
the reason he failed was he wasn't 

321
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,580
conservative enough.
Well,

322
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,360
the problem with that is a George W Bush
brought to Washington,

323
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,960
uh,
alongside a,

324
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,923
for most of his term,
a majority conservative congress and 

325
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,940
quite conservative judiciary,
an entire movement,

326
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,193
entire set of institutions and entire 
bureaucracy that conservatives have 

327
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,780
built up,
you know,

328
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,790
in the years since Barry Goldwater.
So when George Bush is president,

329
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,820
he is not just a acting independently,
but he's acting for the figurehead,

330
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:22,980
for,
you know,

331
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,260
an enormous movement that was able to 
insinuates itself,

332
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:27,094
uh,
up and down in the bureaucracy and up 

333
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,120
and down the political chain.

334
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,700
So that's where the blame asked to lie.
Now with George Bush,

335
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,883
those kinds of people I come across once
in a generation and you can't pick them 

336
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:43,670
out of a catalog and they can kind of 
tend to come from surprising places,

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,833
you know,
certainly,

338
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,040
you know,
19,

339
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,250
62 when Ronald Reagan was,
you know,

340
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:51,370
it's washed up act going around from Ge,
planted Ge plant,

341
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,490
given patriotic speeches.
No one saw that it was him.

342
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,730
You know,
I don't see who it is,

343
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,160
but if I saw how it was then you know,
I'd be a,

344
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,073
you know,
a genius political consultant or I'd be 

345
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:04,284
a great leader myself.
I mean a leaders see things in the 

346
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,910
public will that are often invisible to 
the rest of us mere mortals.

347
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,150
There will always be an American 
conservatism.

348
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:20,140
It's completely continuous.
You know,

349
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,993
throughout our history,
it has its own shifts and changes and 

350
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,510
evolutions in some positions.
You know,

351
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,353
that helped in the past.
It doesn't hold now and some positions 

352
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,080
that holds,
holds,

353
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,080
it holds now,
it didn't hold in the past.

354
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:31,914
You know,
for example,

355
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,943
you know the concern,
if you're a conservative in the 19 

356
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:35,034
thirties,
you're known as someone who didn't 

357
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,790
believe in foreign military 
intervention,

358
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,953
right?
You were fighting against the idea that 

359
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,650
America should rearm for World War II.
Now,

360
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,730
of course,
uh,

361
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:45,564
you know,
conservatives are the people who are 

362
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:47,200
most likely to,
you know,

363
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,233
call for a huge defense establishment 
and be more eager to kind of go on 

364
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,703
overseas adventures,
but something having to do with 

365
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,494
individualism,
having to do with sort of this 

366
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:02,181
fetishization of the nuclear family and 
traditional values having to do with the

367
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:07,530
belief that a businessman's republic 
kind of run a bind for businessman who's

368
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,393
a benevolence,
kind of trickles down to ordinary 

369
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:10,554
people.

370
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,830
That's always been a part of American 
political culture.

371
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,570
And it always will be.
I mean,

372
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,880
the challenge for progressives is just 
to,

373
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,823
you know,
put together a coalition to make sure 

374
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:20,604
that,
um,

375
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,530
you know,
the conservative coalition,

376
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,630
uh,
doesn't have enough power to,

377
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,380
to,
I would say a push through their agenda.

378
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,480
But it's often the case that they don't 
have an agenda.

379
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:31,314
I mean,
there really is no conservative theory 

380
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,754
of government as we saw for especially 
the first six years of the Bush 

381
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,210
administration in which,
you know,

382
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,480
basically had,
you know,

383
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,333
conservative hammerlock on the forces of
the state and all they were able to 

384
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,940
really do was a weekend,
you know,

385
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,963
the state weaken our ability to 
collectively solve our problems 

386
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,133
together.

387
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,900
Well,
among conservatives saying,

388
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,870
your libertarian is always been a way to
say,

389
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,793
uh,
I believe in everything having to do 

390
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:08,424
with conservatism except the 
embarrassing stuff now except the stuff 

391
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,260
except the,
you know,

392
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:16,620
the spiritual warfare casting out demons
from certain zip codes,

393
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:17,040
which was,
you know,

394
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,640
a big part of Ted Haggard's paradigm.
And the church,

395
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,260
the Pentecostal Church that,
uh,

396
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,140
Sarah Pailin is involved with.
Um,

397
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,160
so it's always been a more of a gesture 
than anything else.

398
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,994
Of course,
the people who call themselves 

399
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,493
libertarians within the Republican party
at least had been quite willing to go 

400
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:35,610
along with,
you know,

401
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,680
these kind of violations of civil 
liberties.

402
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,690
They have kind of gone along with the 
war on terrorism.

403
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,000
Although there are,
you know,

404
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,430
genuine libertarians on the right who 
have been actually quite heroic,

405
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,553
you know,
at preserving the principles of civil 

406
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,600
liberties,
um,

407
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,710
you know,
on a,

408
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:51,544
among Democrats,
among liberals who find themselves a 

409
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,530
enraptured by the concepts of 
libertarianism.

410
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,600
Um,
it's not as good a fit.

411
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,380
I mean,
some,

412
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,600
some folks have been talking now about 
libertarian,

413
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,660
liberal Terry aneurysm,
which is the idea that liberalism can be

414
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,404
stripped of its kind of paternalistic 
elements and a respect the autonomy 

415
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:16,930
people better.
Well,

416
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:17,764
the problem with that is that's always 
been the ideal of liberalism and 

417
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,324
liberalism at it's best and the 
Democratic Party and its most mature 

418
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,880
form has,
uh,

419
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,240
always,
uh,

420
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,423
you know,
attempted to create the maximum amount 

421
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,930
of equality alongside the maximum amount
of freedom.

422
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,764
Now it's something that's often an 
honored only in the breach because 

423
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:46,831
that's the hardest thing for human 
societies to be able to accomplish.

424
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,030
But,
you know,

425
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,863
I mean,
the,

426
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,570
the liberal vision,
you know,

427
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,840
dovetails with what's called in the rest
of the world social democracy,

428
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,830
which is that you can't really enjoy 
anything,

429
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,963
uh,
like liberty unless you have some 

430
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,440
minimum standard of living,
you know,

431
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:08,260
unless you're free to change jobs,
uh,

432
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,550
if you hate your boss and you're not 
afraid of losing your health insurance,

433
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,800
you know,
that's neither paternalistic,

434
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,390
you know,
uh,

435
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,540
nor is it a socialistic.
It's entrepreneurial,

436
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,471
right?
So that's,

437
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,010
you know,
that's,

438
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,461
that's,
you know,

439
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:24,520
straight down the center of liberalism 
and,

440
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,473
um,
that's something a libertarian would 

441
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,930
reject because it involves expanding the
role for the state.

442
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,153
But a liberal at its best understands 
that sometimes expanding the state can 

443
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:41,140
actually enhance liberty in pretty 
profound ways.
