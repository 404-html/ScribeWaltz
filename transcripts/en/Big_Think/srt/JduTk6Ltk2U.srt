1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,723
Yeah,

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,330
I think that that dig is,
is very much,

3
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,740
um,
it's,

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,850
it's a living,
breathing thing that is impossible to

5
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,080
kind of wrap your head around in.
You never know what's going to happen on

6
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:26,520
the side.
I think that's one of the things that

7
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:30,060
brings a lot of people back to the side.
Like I think that when you take a look

8
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,830
at a,
when I wake up in the morning,

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,660
you know,
it's the same feeling in my gut that I

10
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,230
had,
you know,

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,620
three and a half years ago and that's
what the hell's in the front page like I

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,940
have no idea,
you know,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,060
and it's that freaky kind of,
uh,

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,440
um,
you know,

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,630
you never know what you're going to,
you're going to get and it's always a,

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,800
tends to be interesting and kind of gems
that you wouldn't find anywhere else.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,560
I think that's,
that's what's unique and what keeps

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,100
people coming back,
absolutely.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,680
To,
to bring people together and get them

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,060
talking and in,
uh,

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,990
outside of the online community is a big
deal and it's something that we would

22
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:06,880
like to continue to,
to do.

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,350
Um,
it's important for the company,

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,610
uh,
it's important to get users some face

25
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:14,440
time with you so they can give you and
share their ideas,

26
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,690
their feedback.
Uh,

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,100
it's so much better than just an email
coming in.

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,520
I'm not only that,
but I think it's important as we kind of

29
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,370
evolve our side as well.
Um,

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,840
you know,
one of the things that we'll be

31
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:27,450
launching in the future,
um,

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,760
is our stories suggest feature and um,
we call it our recommendation engine and

33
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,750
it's a piece of software that analyzes
all of the gigs that are happening in

34
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,410
real time across the site and it
compares you to other users.

35
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,360
So you may be dig number 3000 on the
story,

36
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,000
but who were those other 2,999 people.

37
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,730
And what else are they finding that you
might also find interesting?

38
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,800
So when we start to do these things,
we can surface stories very early on

39
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,920
before they become popular.
Um,

40
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,720
that we can kind of,
in our own heads,

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,480
hopefully predict that they will,
uh,

42
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,600
become very popular stories.
It's Kinda this weird game,

43
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,210
this kind of,
we call it behind the scenes,

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,320
we call them like a pressure users,
like users,

45
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:11,980
they can predict the future,
the tastemakers and news.

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,040
Um,
and it's really interesting because as

47
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,290
we start to surface these stories,
um,

48
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:22,291
we also are finding likeminded
individuals and so in the future on dig,

49
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,790
not only we will say,
okay,

50
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,650
you know,
we realize you've been digging stories

51
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:30,160
about a oolong tea in the R,
so here's some awesome stories that you

52
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,720
might find interesting,
but you know,

53
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:35,410
here's 10 other users that you're
constantly agreeing with that you had no

54
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,350
idea you were agreeing with.
And so we're gonna start making those

55
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,880
introductions.
Um,

56
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,100
and once we do that,
I mean we want to have meetups and get

57
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,450
together.
There's things where people can come out

58
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,141
and say like,
Hey,

59
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,580
you know,
I really enjoyed that story that you

60
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,200
submitted and like make those
connections,

61
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,300
those real world connections.
Um,

62
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,380
so it's,
it's,

63
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,320
it's pretty cool and it's fun and
hopefully we'll have that feature out in

64
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,220
a,
in a few months.

65
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,910
What it comes down to is the quality of
content and who's writing the articles.

66
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,530
Um,
I think that if,

67
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,230
if dig has done anything,
it's really leveled the playing field,

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,970
um,
for traditional media.

69
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:07,721
So,
you know,

70
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:12,580
a story can come from the New York Times
or from somebody whose blog that they

71
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,780
run out of their basement and receive a,
the same amount of traffic,

72
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,703
you know,
I,

73
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,260
um,
which is,

74
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,880
which is insane,
which just wasn't possible a few years

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,570
ago.
I mean,

76
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,510
to think that there could be a story on
the front page of the New York Times

77
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,880
that,
that doesn't get as much traffic as

78
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,480
some.
Someone's blog that makes the front page

79
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,140
of Digg is just crazy.
But it's great because really what it's

80
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:37,141
doing is it's saying it's really not
about the one destination so much as it

81
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,650
is about the quality of the article and
the story that's being presented right

82
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:42,670
and what people want to read.

83
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,170
So,
um,

84
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,120
for us,
uh,

85
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,200
you know,
I've seen a lot of people in traditional

86
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,940
media writers that have said,
um,

87
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,930
you know,
my blog is now popular enough to where

88
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,070
I'm receiving enough ad revenue where I
could consider doing this full time.

89
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,500
You know,
I can leave my nine to five and say,

90
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,610
okay,
this is my blog,

91
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,600
this is who I am as a writer and uh,
and,

92
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,530
and do that.
And there's been several people malick

93
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,160
who wrote for a business to Oh,
left and started his own,

94
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,460
a network of blog sites that are doing
quite well.

95
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,750
And um,
you know,

96
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,610
I think it just gives people more
options in the future.

97
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:19,550
But I mean quality will always,
always prevail.

98
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,150
And I think that there's going to be a,
uh,

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,710
place in,
in need for that and there's going to be

100
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,700
a need for people that do the deep dive
when it comes to news and,

101
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,900
you know,
the fact checking and the people that

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,760
they're still going to need to need to
be teams around certain types of

103
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,260
stories.
Um,

104
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,360
and that's always going to survive.

105
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,470
The deep dive is being defined slightly
differently now than,

106
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,560
than it was,
I mean,

107
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,950
when,
when you think about the way that a

108
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,620
traditional newspapers would do that,
they would have a team working on a

109
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,140
story that would follow that story
throughout its lifespan.

110
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,190
Right?
And do the follow ups,

111
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:58,540
the fact checking and all that.
Now all of these users that are editors

112
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,060
on dig and,
and uh,

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,140
by editors,
I mean registered users that submit

114
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,300
stories.
They're the ones that are doing the fact

115
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,134
checking.
I mean,

116
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,240
without a doubt,
we have stories every single day that

117
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,950
are marked and flagged as an accurate,
you know,

118
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:11,320
there'll be a story that submitted,
hits the front page and the users,

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,860
they have different barry options and if
they go and they do the research and

120
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,330
they,
they've checked the different sites and

121
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:16,781
then say,
okay,

122
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:17,740
this doesn't add up.

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,550
They'll submit it in the comments.
They'll oftentimes submit a followup

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,260
story and the flag,
the articles inaccurate and they'll say

125
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,170
that right at the top of the article.
So that,

126
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,070
that happens all the time.
Um,

127
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,821
but,
uh,

128
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,200
you know,
it really,

129
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,260
it really comes down to,
um,

130
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,051
uh,
I mean,

131
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,390
I don't think that's going away,
I think is,

132
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,200
it's slightly evolving when it comes to
dig,

133
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,360
but traditional websites,
I'm sure we'll still have that,

134
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,090
um,
because they need that for their own

135
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,940
kind of a set of stories in their own
personal site,

136
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:44,260
their own,
their own branded site.

137
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,530
Um,
but for us it's very much this living

138
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,120
and breathing thing that happens on dig
where,

139
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,920
you know,
store will come up and then there'll be

140
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,720
a rebuttal to that story that comes up,
you know,

141
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:56,020
a few hours later and it's constant news
is just getting pushed down.

142
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,840
So it's just the way that we do it
in discussions that we have with

143
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,070
traditional media when they come in and
they say,

144
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,750
okay,
you know,

145
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,480
oftentimes we'll,
we'll get phone calls and say,

146
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,770
Hey,
can you meet with us?

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
We just want to sit down and have a
conversation about where things are

148
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,760
headed.
And um,

149
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,720
we sit down and say,
okay,

150
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,120
you know,
obviously you guys have just exploded on

151
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:22,140
the scene and now you're the second or
third highest a referral traffic to our

152
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:24,900
site and we just want to know how can we
work with you better?

153
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,310
And I think that one of the things I'm
dig will do in the future,

154
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:32,430
it's kind of refined some of these tools
for these publisher sites and say,

155
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,470
okay,
what type of information can we give

156
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:38,540
them a tool to make to really inform
their writers and,

157
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,131
and,
and,

158
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:44,050
and educate them about what the masses
are wanting and really shortening kind

159
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,600
of the feedback loop,
you know,

160
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,240
it's,
it's really about the message that

161
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,200
they're getting from their readers in
real time as opposed to printing

162
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,180
something and just hoping people are
going to like it,

163
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,940
you know.

164
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,050
Um,
and those are tools that we're working

165
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,530
on and stuff that we'll have out,
uh,

166
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,700
in the future.
Can't really say,

167
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,630
oh,
10 more about that.

168
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,200
But it's,
it's good.
