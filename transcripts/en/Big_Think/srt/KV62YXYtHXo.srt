1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,610
Marriage is always seemed a little bit
problematic to me,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,940
the idea that a government gets to
decide whether or not you are married

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:14,761
according to a given set of laws or a
religious authority gets to do so.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,370
I was thinking about this as I was in
the process of getting married and

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,890
thinking about the fact that honestly,
as much as that paperwork would matter

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,030
to the government,
it wouldn't really matter much to me or

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,080
to my future wife.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,240
I wanted to find a way to get married
that was deeper,

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,660
that was more universal than whatever
sort of legal framework could be thrown

10
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:59,951
my way by the United States government.
I want it to instead be married by a law

11
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:07,931
of nature that is possible today,
perhaps for the first time because of

12
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,950
advances in quantum physics,
you wouldn't think it.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Quantum physics tends to be either
highly theoretical or a system that is

14
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:20,780
used.
For instance,

15
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,090
in cryptography.
However,

16
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,270
quantum entanglement,
one of the essential systems that comes

17
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:33,791
out of quantum mechanics is one that has
the potential,

18
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:38,831
I believe,
to serve as a way in which marriage can

19
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:44,180
be based on a truly universal
foundation.

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Quantum entanglement involves two or
more particles becoming effectively one

21
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:58,031
and the same even if they are separated
across the universe from each other when

22
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,650
they are entangled.
Everything that happens to one

23
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,300
instantaneously happens to the other as
if it had been done to the second

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,183
particle.

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,260
That quality seems an awful lot like
what marriage is about,

26
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,090
this way in which you can lead separate
lives and yet you still are somehow

27
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:28,631
bound and whatever comes away of one
person in a relationship also applies to

28
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:35,291
the other.
So I set about building an apparatus

29
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,110
that would allow my wife and I and
others as well to become entangled,

30
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:46,820
to become married in a way that no
governmental authority,

31
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:50,990
no religious authority could say that.
That it was not allowed,

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,860
that it was inappropriate.
That gay marriage,

33
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:58,670
for instance,
would not be an issue that a government

34
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:02,890
could.
That any sort of relationship at all.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
If it was meaningful to you could become
fully manifest as an entangled

36
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:14,890
relationship,
as a marriage at the basis of all

37
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:19,390
reality.
The apparatus was very simple.

38
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,230
I used a special sort of crystal which
was able to take sunlight,

39
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,050
photons and bombard two people standing
below the apparatus with those photons

40
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,650
in a way that they themselves became
entangled by the entanglement of the

41
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,150
photons so that while it would not
necessarily be all of them,

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
while it would not necessarily withstand
all time and space,

43
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,930
they could partake in this process of
entanglement and they could then take

44
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:59,590
away from it what they wanted to take
away.

45
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,070
That is to say that any quantum system
is extremely delicate.

46
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,140
Entanglement is no exception.
Any measurement that you make has the

47
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,770
effect of collapsing the system.
In other words,

48
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,270
two particles that are entangled if you
check to see if they are entangled,

49
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,540
will become disentangled,
and so likewise to people who are

50
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,170
married by the process of quantum
entanglement,

51
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,970
should they questioned that bond and
start to interrogate it will become

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,620
disentangled as well.
So in a sense,

53
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,720
the entanglement operates both literally
and metaphorically.

54
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,260
Literally because I'm using real
equipment that is used for entanglement

55
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,440
for purposes of encryption,
for instance,

56
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,770
to entangle people and people are
becoming genuinely entangled by that

57
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,540
process,
but it is also,

58
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,960
I think more importantly,
the knowledge that that process has

59
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:09,961
taken place and the way in which that
makes those people behave.

60
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,140
That is what makes for an entanglement
so special as a form of marriage.

61
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,290
The fact that it really has to be taken
on faith ultimately because the quantum

62
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:28,171
mechanics demands that and relationships
are that way to relationships are

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,370
delicate in the sense that quantum
systems are so.

64
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:38,371
I think that we can actually learn from
subatomic particles how to behave toward

65
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,060
each other in a caring,
longterm relationship.

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I think that the metaphor that is
inherent in language and in the common

67
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,781
understanding of a quantum process can
be something that we can apply quite

68
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,450
literally and highly productively in our
everyday lives.

69
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,640
He might say that metaphors are just
metaphors.

70
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,770
No,
like a poem.

71
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,400
How important can it be helped?
Seriously.

72
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:15,401
Can you take something that was meant
for the enjoyment that you might get

73
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,810
reading a book?
To what extent can you really make use

74
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,090
of it?
I think that metaphor actually is

75
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,210
something that can be used incredibly
productively by taking it literally not

76
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:38,540
by taking it literally and leaving it at
that,

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,320
but recognizing the metaphor for what it
is and finding what happens if you apply

78
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:53,201
it literally in your life so that in the
case of quantum physics,

79
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,900
because quantum physics is so weird
because quantum particles behave in ways

80
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:05,000
that are so totally foreign to the way
in which we live,

81
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,970
to our experience of the world.

82
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Much of the discussion of quantum
physics happens metaphorically and the

83
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,350
metaphors can be mined.
I think it can be applied.

84
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,580
I believe in ways that lead through
their literal application to different

85
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,880
ways in which we can relate to each
other in the world.

86
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,730
That is to say that quantum particles
relate to each other in ways that are

87
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,110
entirely different from those with which
we are familiar from those with which we

88
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,460
relate with each other on an everyday
basis.

89
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,760
The way in which we relate to each other
on an everyday basis.

90
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,630
It doesn't always work so well.
We fight.

91
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,030
We have problems communicating,
we go to war,

92
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,790
so might it be possible taking the
quantum realm,

93
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,840
the metaphors that are used to explain
how quantum particles interact and

94
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:25,220
applying those metaphors literally in
our lives that we made,

95
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,280
realign the way in which we live that
makes us somehow unlike how we were

96
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:38,741
before and that repositioning,
while it need not be absolute or

97
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,990
permanent,
at least can be something that we can

98
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:45,350
try out,
can be another way in which we can

99
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,390
consider our relationship with others
and can through that process,

100
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:54,350
give us more perspective on the myriad
possibilities.

101
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,740
As far as a society where there are 7
billion of us for how that society can

102
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:02,660
interact and interrelate.
