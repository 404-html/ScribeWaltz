1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,220
No,
in actual fact we haven't discovered a

2
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,470
huge amount of obesity genes at the
moment,

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,670
but you know,
they're almost certainly is and we know

4
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:21,090
that there are genes involved in the
development of predisposition to

5
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:25,920
diabetes and so on and we know that
diabetes is going to becoming a massive

6
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:28,620
problem over the next sort of 20 to 30
years ago.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,390
Estimates in the range of $400,
million people with diabetes by 2030

8
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,480
around the world.
And what we're,

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,510
what we would like to understand is how
does your genetic predisposition

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,310
interact with your environmental
predispositioned to,

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,600
you know,
culture,

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,400
um,
what,

13
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,590
um,
what kind of foods that you eat,

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,970
you know,
et Cetera,

15
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,580
et cetera.
And that's the piece that we want to try

16
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:01,581
and understand and sort of tease apart
and what for diabetics,

17
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,520
what does that mean in terms of your
likelihood of getting cardiovascular

18
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,540
disease and so on.

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,290
So I think those are the areas in which
is going to be a lot of work to try and

20
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:15,291
sort of understand the differences in
populations and the differences in rates

21
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,370
of obesity between different
populations.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,940
How much of that is genetic,
how much of it is environment and what

23
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,130
can one do to get a to get around the
other?

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,930
So what,
what kind of lifestyle changes can you

25
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:32,160
make to get around your genetic
predisposition to developing obesity

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:35,340
and,
and also what kind of behavioral

27
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,790
components might make it difficult or
easy for you to do that?

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,100
You know,
because it's often very difficult for

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,620
people to change their lifestyle.
And that's where I,

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,670
that's where it's often a big challenge.
So we all know we're supposed to do in

31
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,600
order to keep healthy most of the time,
but it's difficult to do.
