1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,180
I mean Google of Rod is,
you know,

2
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:11,671
just,
just,

3
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,200
just recently rolled out,
um,

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,291
integration of,
of,

5
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,480
of realtime search and taking twitter
and,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,770
and uh,
and status updates and putting that in

7
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:21,590
as one of the options within the web.
And obviously,

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,330
I mean,
not just not just google news,

9
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:26,600
but number different google properties
are all very curious and,

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,370
and,
and beating to think through what does

11
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,320
it mean for us?
How do we take advantage of that?

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,630
Um,
the way I,

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,630
the way I,
I,

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,370
I think about it from,
from the new side of it,

15
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,100
is there,
there,

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,580
there are two aspects of it.
One is just the content itself.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,740
I mean,
is there value in those tweets,

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,960
um,
uh,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,790
or is it just,
is your sort of stream of information

20
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,040
that by itself just adds more noise to
it?

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,170
I think there's probably some of both.

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,310
And,
and that's,

23
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,190
that's a key part of what we try and do
is not just index the world's

24
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,410
information,
but also trying to organize it in some

25
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:56,750
level.
And so applying that to real time

26
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:59,000
information is very challenging.
Um,

27
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:01,790
so I think that that's one thing that
we're looking at the other part of is

28
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,960
just simply as another signal,
um,

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,750
of,
of a way of sort of picking up those

30
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,750
tweets about a certain topic or linking
to a certain story.

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,450
And is there a signal there that's
helpful for us and trying to pick up

32
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,600
information quicker.
We're trying to understand people's

33
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,630
preferences for certain sources are for
certain stories.

34
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,420
Um,
and so even if you never even surface

35
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,520
that information that we're,
that the real time tweets that are

36
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:24,470
there,
how can you leverage those,

37
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,600
uh,
those signals to do a better job of

38
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,160
presenting what you have on your own
site.

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,880
So I think both of those are areas that
we're actively looking at and trying to

40
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:34,640
figure out what's there.
But I'm sure we'll put something out

41
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,740
there and,
and maybe the first iteration will,

42
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:37,850
will,
will not work.

43
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,560
But that's,
that's I think,

44
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,450
um,
that's sort of the fun part about trying

45
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,860
to see how you can,
you can move forward and that's a makes,

46
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,400
makes things never dull.

47
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,541
I,
uh,

48
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:55,160
I don't know that in,
in just a few seconds or minutes or

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,881
probably hours,
I could explain what,

50
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:56,714
what,
uh,

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,760
what ways,
I think that the idea behind wave that

52
00:01:58,761 --> 00:01:59,630
was,
was really interesting.

53
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,590
It was,
um,

54
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,840
if email didn't exist,
how would you communicate?

55
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:03,980
I think that was sort of the,
the,

56
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,300
the thought that a lot of the engineers,
um,

57
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,140
started with,
with,

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,520
with Google wave and really trying to
reimagine how people can communicate.

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,320
Um,
so it's part email,

60
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,680
it's part chat.
Uh,

61
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,970
it's part collaborative,
a collaborative documents.

62
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,090
Um,
so it's kind of all these roll together.

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,360
It's,
it's one of these things you need to

64
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:24,080
play around with it to,
to really even begin to try and

65
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,900
articulate what it is.
But that's one of the things is that

66
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:29,150
we've gotten a lot of interest from,
uh,

67
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,270
from journalists saying,
we think this is really fits well with

68
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,440
how we do our job.

69
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,960
And this is,
this is potentially a tool that we would

70
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:37,590
want to take advantage of,
um,

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,680
to tell stories,
to create that to,

72
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,720
um,
uh,

73
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,740
to create stories in a different way
than how we do it right now.

74
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:46,310
Even though it sort of fits with the way
we gather facts and information and

75
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,380
check and check sources,
um,

76
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,070
like how do we,
how do we sort of met,

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,890
migrate that to the web and make it a
much more of an,

78
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,810
of an open process.
Uh,

79
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,060
I think wave is still at the early
stages,

80
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,800
uh,
to try and figure out how it's going to

81
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,000
be used.
Um,

82
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,430
and journalism is just sort of one of
the things that we've,

83
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,690
we've seen a few different organizations
beginning to play around with don't know

84
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,130
what's,
what's ultimately gonna happen with,

85
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,510
with either wave,
the,

86
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,050
the larger discussion and also
specifically around around journalism.

87
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,411
Well,
it's certainly,

88
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:17,280
I mean,
the things that I talked about,

89
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,380
some of those trends in a,
about personalization,

90
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,370
um,
I mean that,

91
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,910
that's a big one for us.
Uh,

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,050
and the social nature of news,
uh,

93
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,421
to,
I mean,

94
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,100
I think those are things that,
um,

95
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,470
we,
we've had in bits and pieces,

96
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:30,960
but I don't think we've necessarily
gotten it all together.

97
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,790
Um,
it's tough.

98
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,290
I mean,
it's really hard when you talk about

99
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,440
personalization.
Even explicit personalization is not

100
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,790
easy to do well.
Uh,

101
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,310
and even if you get those,
those signals from users,

102
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,830
I'm trying to make sure that you get
them right and you interpret them in the

103
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,600
right way.
That's not an easy,

104
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,330
easy challenge to say nothing of.
The whole idea of implicit

105
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:51,090
personalization of just saying,
I come to the website,

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,760
you should know what I'm supposed to,
what would I want to read?

107
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,320
Um,
need to say that,

108
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,370
that,
that's even trickier.

109
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,750
So those are some of the things that
we're,

110
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,340
we're really thinking about.
And how do you,

111
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,560
how do you present that in a,
in a,

112
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:02,610
in a,
in a meaningful way to our users?

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,420
The balance,
because I think you don't want to have

114
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:13,590
the sort of echo chamber where you're
just getting that same news and

115
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:16,440
information from the same sources and
people that you've,

116
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,530
you've always gotten before.
Um,

117
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,490
I think you really want to try and have
that balance of,

118
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:22,170
of information that's personalized to
you.

119
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,550
Um,
but sort of,

120
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,520
uh,
at the same time you don't want to lose

121
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,310
the serendipity.
Um,

122
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,850
and also the important news and
information.

123
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:31,800
Let's say you need to know,
you may not want to read this,

124
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,390
but you need to know this.
Uh,

125
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,010
and so those are,
those are some of the things that I

126
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:36,120
think are,
um,

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,230
you know,
can be challenged on the web,

128
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:39,780
especially at the serendipity of it.
Like I was not searching for this.

129
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,040
I didn't know that I wanted to read
this,

130
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,840
but I'm glad that I found this on my,
uh,

131
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,393
on my site.

132
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,800
That's much easier to do right now in a
paper.

133
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,050
And he sort of pick it up.
You see the top stories of the day,

134
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:51,090
but then there,
here's an article the editors decided to

135
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,360
place on the front page because they
think it's important that they think

136
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,270
that it's interesting.
How do you introduce that online?

137
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,261
Um,
so those are,

138
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:00,300
those were some of the things you need
to balance with that,

139
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,741
you know,
the,

140
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:03,360
the,
the really personalized news stream with

141
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:04,650
other things that just,
you know,

142
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,220
you may not know that they matter,
or rather you may not be thinking,

143
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,160
thinking them through to sort of say,
I want to search for it.

144
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,190
I want to subscribe to this feed.
But how do I get that in front of a,

145
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,630
it's important that,
that I get that in front of the user.
