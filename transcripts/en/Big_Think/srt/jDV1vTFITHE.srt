1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,980
I don't think the political philosophers
have any,

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,620
have any special insight into,
um,

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,050
into everyday politics as I,
as I suggested before,

4
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,870
most political philosophers are more
interested in philosophy than in

5
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:28,140
politics.
So that doesn't give them any,

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,770
um,
any handle on what's going on in the

7
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,110
world,
in my experience in the academic world

8
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,050
is that,
that academics are not much more

9
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:41,760
intelligent about everyday issues then
than ordinary citizens.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,800
Um,
they are more knowledgeable.

11
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,820
They can call up historical references,
but that doesn't mean they get things

12
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,740
right here and hearing now.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Hose John Edwards was the candidate most
committed to an organized campaign to

14
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,610
reduce any qualities in American
society.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,060
And he didn't get very far this,
uh,

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,770
this time.
Um,

17
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,590
I,
I,

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,980
I,
I suppose I,

19
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:19,260
I think that Hillary Clinton is,
um,

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,970
is of the remaining to the most like a
European social democratic politician,

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,560
a policy wonky with a lot of ideas about
concretely what ought to be done.

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,810
Um,
and with all the compromises that social

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,600
democratic politicians always ended up
making,

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,740
um,
and Obama is,

25
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:45,350
um,
is from my perspective,

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,380
a relatively unknown,
uh,

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,660
uh,
quality.

28
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:51,620
He,
um,

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,910
I suppose he is a centrist Democrat and
any,

30
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,660
any Democrat centrist,
right or left is going to,

31
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,680
um,
is going to change the way America has

32
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:08,681
been moving in the last eight years,
maybe in the last 40 years.

33
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,930
Um,
but how,

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,490
how committed he is to change.
I know he's committed to the rhetoric of

35
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,610
change,
but how committed he is to actual

36
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:24,611
concrete change on the ground and how
prepared he is to fight the necessary

37
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,400
fights which will be very partisan and
very ugly in.

38
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:33,401
Won't permit him to ride above partisan
conflict the way he has been doing in

39
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,270
the,
in the campaign.

40
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,040
How prepared he is for that.
I don't,

41
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,820
I don't know.
