1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,330
I don't know how else to describe it,
but the joy is seeing it finished.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,080
The joy is seeing people using the
building,

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,590
seeing them,
enjoying being there,

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,570
seeing their response to the uniqueness
of the place.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,890
We have many projects here that are
extraordinary.

6
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:37,450
Drawings had beautiful models,
but they're not realize,

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,550
and for me that's the saddest thing
because the joy is the realization

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,110
struggle is getting it realized.
The struggle was dealing with a myriad

9
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:50,920
of people that sometimes come and go
during the building process.

10
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,310
I've been involved in many,
many projects were the only person who's

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,350
there from the beginning to the end is
the architect of the people who have

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,960
prominent positions in decisions that
are made aren't there to see what those

13
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:12,920
decisions cause and how they affect what
is fine.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,290
Maryville.
