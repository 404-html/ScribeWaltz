1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,940
It's really weird because I write for,
it's this high culture magazine in all

2
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,680
of my great original influences.
I like low culture.

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,550
I mean,
I,

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,110
I love Fitzgerald.
I love,

5
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:20,950
I love,
love,

6
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:21,850
love fits.
Joe,

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,691
you know,
I,

8
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,850
I love the New Yorker.
Um,

9
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:28,390
I love all these high culture things,
but the first things that taught me

10
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:32,290
about how words were beautiful,
it was like hip hop and dungeons and

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,730
dragons and I can't remember a taking
dungeons and dragons has all these.

12
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:38,950
I'm about to get real nerdy on you.
I hope you're ready for this.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,530
They're using dragon says all these,
these great books.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,690
Okay.
And so like I can remember taking one of

15
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:44,930
the books is the monsters,
man.

16
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,330
You went into the list of all these
mythological monsters that inhabit a

17
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,550
world of Greyhawk,
of dungeons and dragons.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,210
And I can remember just sitting back and
flipping through and looking at the

19
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,270
words and the descriptions and,
and it would come alive for me.

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,930
And that was a beautiful thing.
I was the first lesson for me

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,320
about how words can take you somewhere
else and a hip hop was the first lesson

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,720
in terms of how words are beautiful.
Um,

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
my parents were very much in the books
and so I,

24
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,340
I read a lot,
certainly as a kid,

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,860
um,
but in terms of people talking in the

26
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,160
language,
the kids speak in a,

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,730
someone speaking in the slang of my
generation,

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,490
um,
when I heard something like a rock him

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,650
follow the leader,
he says I could take a phrase that's

30
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,330
rarely heard,
flip it,

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,670
and now it's a daily word.
And that was like,

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,241
hi,
cool.

33
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,860
For me,
that was beautiful.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,240
That was beautiful.
And I desperately wanted to do something

35
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:46,230
that beautiful.
Um,

36
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,400
and it wasn't the sort of thing that you
thought it was beautiful because someone

37
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,080
told you it was beautiful,
you felt it.

38
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:56,280
It was a feeling like here.
Uh,

39
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,430
and of course all your friends,
a lot of your friends felt it too.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,530
But
a lot of things later I,

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,430
I had to learn.
So I later in college I studied poetry,

42
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,790
which is also a huge influence on me.
But I had to learn why poetry was

43
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,960
beautiful.
Um,

44
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,110
I really did.
I had to learn why art was beautiful.

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,140
Um,
I had to learn why certain music was

46
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:18,000
beautiful.
Um,

47
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,780
and that,
and that's true for certain aspects of

48
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:21,320
hip hop,
but a,

49
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,280
for a lot of it,
it touched on such a visceral level.

50
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,940
I desperately wanted to create something
that did that.

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,450
Still do.
