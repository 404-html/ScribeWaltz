1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,640
Well,
one thing we don't talk about is that

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,760
it's sort of hard to talk about this.
Our,

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,990
our minds have these kinds of back
doors.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,640
There's just,
there's kind of,

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:17,370
if you're human and you wake up and you
open your eyes,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,110
there is a certain set of dimensions to
your experience that can be manipulated.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,240
When I was a kid,
I was a magician.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,020
And you learn all about these limits.
You know that short term memory is about

9
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,240
this long and there's different reaction
times.

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,000
And if you ask people certain questions
in certain ways,

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,290
you can control the answer.
And this is just the structure of being

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,690
human.
To be human means that you are

13
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,180
persuadable in every single moment.
I mean,

14
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:46,710
the thing about magic as an example is
that magic works on everybody sleight of

15
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,520
hand,
right?

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,230
It doesn't matter what language you
speak,

17
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,760
it doesn't matter how intelligent you
are.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,320
It's not about what someone knows,
it's about how your mind actually works.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,820
So knowing this,
it turns out that there's this whole

20
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,750
playbook of persuasive techniques that
actually I learned when I was at the

21
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,980
Stanford persuasive technology lab.
And that most people in Silicon Valley

22
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,610
and the tech industry learned as ways of
getting your attention.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,740
So one example is we are all vulnerable
to social approval.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,950
We really care what other people think
of us.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,490
So for example,
you know when you upload a new photo,

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,250
a new profile photo of yourself on
facebook,

27
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,490
uh,
that's a moment where our mind is very

28
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,970
vulnerable to knowing what other people
think of my new profile photo.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,740
And so when we get new likes on our
profile photo facebook knowing this

30
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:41,910
could actually message me and say,
Oh you have new likes on your profile

31
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:46,620
photo and we it knows that will be
vulnerable to that moment because we all

32
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:50,130
really care about when we're tagged in a
photo or when we have a new profile

33
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:50,964
photo.

34
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,880
And the thing is that they control the
dial,

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,480
the technology companies control the
dial for when and how long your profile

36
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,710
photo shows up on other people's news
feeds so they can orchestrate it so that

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,720
other people more often end up liking
your profile photo over a delayed period

38
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,830
of time,
for example.

39
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,060
So that you end up having to more
frequently come back and see what the

40
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,410
new lights are.
Right?

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,770
And the problem is that they don't do
this because they're evil.

42
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,740
They do it because again,
they're in this race for our attention.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,580
And we should also ask,
is that necessarily such a bad thing if

44
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,130
they're orchestrating it so that other
people,

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,890
uh,
like my,

46
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,210
my photo,
I mean that might feel good to me,

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
but so we have to have a new
conversation about as these technology

48
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:37,200
companies use these techniques,
these vulnerabilities in our minds,

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,930
uh,
when is that actually aligned in good

50
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,260
for us?

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,610
What does that ethical,
when is that,

52
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,080
uh,
honest one?

53
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:46,290
Is that fair?
And what does that dishonest and unfair

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,980
because they're actually manipulating
our minds in a way that doesn't add up

55
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,600
to our spending our time.
Well,

56
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,980
uh,
on the screen.

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,240
Well,
so another vulnerability in our mind is

58
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,770
something called a variable schedule
reward.

59
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,470
And that's like a slot machine in Las
Vegas.

60
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,610
It turns out that slot machines make
more money in the United States then

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,460
baseball,
movies and theme parks combined.

62
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,300
People become addicted to slot machines.
I think it's two to three times faster

63
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,850
than any other kind of gambling in a
casino.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,710
So it's,
it's insane.

65
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,050
And why is that?
Because it's very simple.

66
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:24,430
You just pull a lever and sometimes you
get a reward as you know,

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,200
and sometimes you don't.
And the more random it is and the more

68
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,080
variable it is,
the more addictive it becomes.

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
And the thing is that that turns our
phone into a slot machine because every

70
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,810
time we check our phone,
we're playing the slot machine to see

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,870
what did I get right?
Every time that we,

72
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,400
um,
check our email,

73
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,350
we're,
we're playing the slot machine to see

74
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,320
what did I get?
Did I get invited to an interview at big

75
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,330
think or did I just get another
newsletter?

76
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,300
Right?
Um,

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,550
or if you're on a tent dating site like
tinder and when you're swiping,

78
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,190
each swipe is you're playing the slot
machine to see,

79
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,500
did I get a match?
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

80
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,590
did I get a match?
And the problem is that this dynamic,

81
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,591
these variable schedule rewards or the
slot machine mechanic is so powerful but

82
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,910
it's the,
it's the best thing and addicting people

83
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,130
and putting you in the zone.
Um,

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,300
one of the original designers of the
facebook newsfeed told me that,

85
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,000
um,
the thing that made the news feed work

86
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:22,721
at the very,
very,

87
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,110
very beginning back in 2006,
um,

88
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,280
was in part a hardware innovation.

89
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,990
And I looked at her and I said,
what do you mean?

90
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,350
And she said it was actually the scroll
wheel on a mouse because with the scroll

91
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,210
wheel on the mouse,
your hand never had to leave its resting

92
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,350
position.
You just scroll to see the next thing

93
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,990
and the,
because before that you had to click on

94
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,650
the down button or drag,
move your mouse and drag the Arrow down.

95
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,450
It's called the page.
That way when you don't,

96
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,750
when you can take your two fingers on a
track pad and do this or you can just

97
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,750
scroll on a scroll wheel.
It just means your hand never has to

98
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:58,390
leave its resting position.
And it's more like a slot machine.

99
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:01,990
You can just keep swiping and playing.
Just like in Vegas where there's the

100
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,910
button right there.
They actually changed it.

101
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,670
In fact,
it used to be a lever and now it's just

102
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,240
a button.

103
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,590
And in Vegas,
because it founds,

104
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:12,280
its easier just to get people to,
to see if they get a match this way.

105
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,540
So how much on our phones when we use
our technology,

106
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,960
instagram is like a slot machine.
What's going to come next on the feeds?

107
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,520
You know,
snapchat is a slot machine.

108
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,570
Each time you see the red notifications
and you don't know what's behind it,

109
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,320
you're playing the slot machine when you
click on it to see what did I get right.

110
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,810
And so it's,
it's sprinkled all throughout these

111
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:35,920
products because it's a very compelling
way of getting people's attention.
