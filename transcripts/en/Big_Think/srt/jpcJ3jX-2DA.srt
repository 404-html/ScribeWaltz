1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,190
The reason I put so much time and effort
into creating teslow was,

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,810
uh,
because,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,700
um,
it,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,960
it,
it,

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,540
it,
it has always seemed to me that the,

6
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,190
the,
that,

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,190
that transportation,
we'll,

8
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,960
we'll go electric and should go
electric,

9
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:19,630
but we have an unpriced externality in
the

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,240
negative effects of,
of,

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,090
of gasoline and,
uh,

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
on the environment and also in the,
you know,

13
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,260
the wars that we fight and,
um,

14
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,050
national security and that kind of
thing.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,070
Whenever you have an unpriced
externality,

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,110
you can't quite,
you can't quite rely on the market to,

17
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:41,590
to do the right thing.
So in order to have electric vehicles

18
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,470
come sooner than they otherwise would it
electric vehicles,

19
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:44,740
we're,
we're,

20
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,300
we're always going to be the long term
transportation mechanism.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,000
Um,
but to make that day come sooner,

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,040
uh,
you have to bridge the gap with

23
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,570
innovation.
Petrus,

24
00:00:55,571 --> 00:01:00,571
the goal with Tesla is to try to serve
as a catalyst to accelerate the day,

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,940
um,
uh,

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,630
the day of electric vehicles.

27
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,583
And,
and I,

28
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,850
I think,
um,

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,960
when,
when all said and done,

30
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm hopeful that,
uh,

31
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,630
historians will look back on Tesla and
saint a tesla advanced that by,

32
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,920
um,
at least 10 years,

33
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,900
which at that that would be a huge
victory in my,

34
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,440
in my mind.
And solar city of course is on the

35
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,020
assault,
is on the energy production side of

36
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:27,220
things.
Um,

37
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,350
uh,
because it doesn't help if we have

38
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:31,080
sustainable consumption of energy,
but,

39
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,030
but then that energy isn't produced in a
sustainable way.

40
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,820
And I,
I feel quite strongly that solar power

41
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:40,150
will be the single largest source of
electricity generation,

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,010
uh,
by the midpoint of the century.

43
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,630
Um,
in fact,

44
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:46,190
it just a simple extrapolation of the
growth of solar power would,

45
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,680
would,
would show that that's obviously going

46
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,110
to be the case.
And also when you consider that the

47
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,060
earth is almost entirely solar powered
today,

48
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,010
and that the,
um,

49
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,930
the fact that we're not a frozen ice
ball at say four degrees Calvin and,

50
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,530
uh,
it is just due to the son and the whole

51
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:07,120
ecosystem is powered by the sun.
There's just an anybody amount of energy

52
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:10,900
that we need to do complicated human
things.

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,860
This is a tiny amount of energy really
compared to what the son puts on the

54
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:17,320
earth every day,
and we just need to capture a little bit

55
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,230
of that and turn it into electricity.
Um,

56
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,290
so we have to try to accelerate that
with innovation.

57
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,730
And that's what soldiers things about.
