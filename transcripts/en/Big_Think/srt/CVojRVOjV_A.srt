1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,280
Social Entrepreneurship is an incredibly
exciting movement that was spawned by

2
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:19,281
Bill Drayton about 30 years ago,
who an incredibly visionary entrepreneur

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,650
who had the idea that you could really
do venture capital for the social sector

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:29,691
so you could pick for visionary
entrepreneurs committed to systematic

5
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:35,781
social change who had ethical fiber,
who were committed to social impact,

6
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,690
who were innovative,
and you could back them,

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,210
give them some resources and the global
support system that allowed them to

8
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,570
achieve their goals,
whether it was an environment,

9
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,460
education,
healthcare,

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,990
immigration,
multiple different kinds of areas of

11
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,020
social impact.
And then this movement really rocketed

12
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:03,021
and what allowed it to do so with both
the vision and the power of Ashoka and

13
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,691
it's offshoots like a endeavor and an
acumen and other wonderful organizations

14
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,200
that support social entrepreneurs.
But it was also the massive growth of

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,680
the growth of the social sector.

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,200
So the,
the nonprofits,

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,150
if you look at the numbers,
they're dramatic between 1980 and a

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,520
2005.
You basically had the number of

19
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:28,290
nonprofits in Brazil go from,
I believe it was something like 5,000 to

20
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,680
nearly a million.
Uh,

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,130
you had in the U,
s the number of nonprofits go from

22
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:37,131
around 400,000 to one point 2 million,
so you had this massive burgeoning of

23
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:41,280
the social sector suddenly became a much
bigger space with much more impact.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,360
And if you think about it historically,
this is interesting because in the 19th

25
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:50,361
century we had the industrial revolution
in 18th and 19th century at the

26
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,430
beginning of the 20th century and with
the,

27
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,480
and with the world wars,
we had the massive growth of the state,

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,610
uh,
so you had the burgeoning of the state,

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,790
but the social sector was left behind
and what you've had in the past decades

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,910
is a massive growth of that sector,
almost an industrial revolution for that

31
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,744
sector.

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,810
Now,
that creates huge opportunities because

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,790
you not only have large numbers of
organizations,

34
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,010
but organizations that can work
together,

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,470
uh,
and have a division of labor where you

36
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,390
achieve much more.
Now,

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,000
what's the next way for social
entrepreneurship?

38
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,350
Well,
I'm particularly excited by things that

39
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,340
go up the next level,
so that help organizations to work

40
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:35,580
together very effectively.
Whether it's collaborative technology

41
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,450
architectures,
whether it's organizations like Ashoka,

42
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,370
endeavor and acumen that helped organize
that,

43
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,100
help entrepreneurs to find
commonalities,

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
show cause it,
group collaborations,

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,640
whether it's a financing vehicles that
go to the next level that back a whole

46
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,580
lot of different companies and try to
see or organizations and see the

47
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:00,220
synergies between those and my companies
and organizations.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
Language is the other really exciting.
Next stage I think we're going to see a

49
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:11,101
whole bunch of hybrid entities going
from zero percent returns,

50
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,840
in other words,
straight charity.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,300
And that's appropriate because why
would,

52
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,180
you know if you're trying to end
slavery,

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,570
you're not going to try to do it on a
profitable basis.

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,593
Uh,
that is a,

55
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,820
a really charitable activity right
through to highly profitable areas like

56
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,370
microinsurance and microcredit where you
can do a and other kinds of social

57
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:40,120
business like grameen phone,
the mobile phone company that can be,

58
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,140
all of these can be hugely profitable
and yet hugely impactful.

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,580
And I went to see a complete range that
goes,

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
you know,
minus 10 percent plus five percent plus

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,640
20 percent plus 60 percent across the
board.

62
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,450
That works.
Now I happened to be most excited myself

63
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,600
about the areas that really bring profit
and purpose together,

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,400
and the reason I'm excited about that is
if you can do something that is hugely

65
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,940
socially impactful,
so it's quality and really helps people

66
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:13,150
with the products you're selling.
And at the same time is highly

67
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,370
profitable.
It's massively scalable,

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,180
and I'm frankly obsessed with the idea
that there are 4 billion poor people out

69
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,200
there.
We don't have time to waste,

70
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,350
we have to do things at scale.
So I want to find mechanisms that really

71
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:33,811
allow for massive rapid scaling that has
a profound impact on the poor.

72
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,220
And that I think is the most exciting,
uh,

73
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,150
arrowhead of social entrepreneurship
right.
