1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,520
The Reagan coalition was based on an
alliance between,

2
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:12,460
on the one hand,
small government,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,560
you know,
pro big business conservatives on the

4
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,830
one hand and the kind of cultural
resentments,

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,320
especially among white working class
Americans on the other,

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,580
they held those together.
It was a very reliable way for the

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,230
Republican Party to retain national
power.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,640
I think that's common glued.
It's come unglued for a variety of

9
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,470
reasons.
2008 being one of them and the

10
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:35,680
Republicans had not much to offer their
working class,

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,380
you know,
followers except what more tax cuts,

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,090
you know,
cut social security.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,670
I mean Donald Trump understood that.
That was one of the reasons that he was

14
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,820
able to come in and take the part tech,
the nomination for himself.

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,900
He understood the class aspects of all
of this in a way that the republican

16
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:52,770
establishment just did not,
and they were coming forward with the

17
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:54,070
all the old bromides.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,240
Right.
And he came along and said,

19
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:55,541
no,
no,

20
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,171
no.
Yeah,

21
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:58,300
the tax issues,
but we can even compromise the tax

22
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,200
stuff.
Minimum wage.

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,390
Maybe not such a bad idea,
but free trade,

24
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:02,320
free trade,
free trade.

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,460
I'm going to be the man who can make the
deals now that is not the typical

26
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:09,610
republican establishment or even the
typical republican line.

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,220
Um,
so he was able to look,

28
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,120
he was able to move to the left,
if you will.

29
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,980
So he's on the left of the Republican
Party.

30
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,420
He's more like Bernie Sanders in many
ways on some issues than he is like the

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,560
Republican Party.
At the same time,

32
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:21,580
he's doing all the,
you know,

33
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,900
the xenophobia,
the racism,

34
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,700
all of that.
So where is the,

35
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,830
the center to all of that?
I don't know,

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,600
which is really what makes him,
I think,

37
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,120
and this is where the Clinton people
have to be very concerned.

38
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,830
It makes them a very unpredictable
candidate.

39
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,180
It makes it very difficult to gauge.
You kind of knew what you were getting

40
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,370
with.
Certainly if Jeb Bush had gotten the

41
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:42,820
nomination or if Ted Cruz had gotten the
nomination to very different people,

42
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,310
you kind of knew what,
what,

43
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:48,820
what was there with trump who cheat,
who changed position that he held at

44
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:51,280
nine o'clock in the morning with great,
you know,

45
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:54,250
I'm great fervor.
You can change it all by four o'clock in

46
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:55,360
the afternoon.
I mean,

47
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,760
this makes it,
we're not dealing in a fact based

48
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,490
universe here.
We're dealing in reality television.

49
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,020
It's something that we,
that no political consultant I think is

50
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,360
quite figured out.
If he becomes president,

51
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,270
will he be able to do everything that he
says he's going to do?

52
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,520
No,
we do have still have a constitution.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,490
If you suspends the Constitution,
um,

54
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,250
as you might imagine and some,
some,

55
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,330
some fantasy,
right?

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,210
We were under great attack or something
and he suspends the Constitution.

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,330
Well then we have a crisis that we've
never faced as a country before except

58
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,120
possibly in the case of obsession in
1860,

59
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,330
61,
um,

60
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,400
where,
you know,

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,250
that was a,
that was a constitutional crisis that

62
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:37,030
ended up with 750,000 military dead.
Um,

63
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,710
um,
I don't want to go through that again.

64
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,930
Can trump do whatever he wants as
president?

65
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:43,630
Can he become a dictator only by
suspending the constitution of the

66
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,270
United States under the constitution
mean that I'd say there are plenty of

67
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,490
subject,
plenty of checks and balances on him.

68
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,310
Not as much as you might like that
within the military.

69
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,540
You know,
he is commander in chief.

70
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,040
So,
uh,

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,050
it,
it would be a crisis presidency.

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,980
Yeah.
Every time you one of these movements

73
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:00,880
and they've been,
again,

74
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,620
they've occurred before in American
history.

75
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,420
There's always an argument that somehow
somebody has taken America away from

76
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,630
Americans and we're going to try to
bring it back,

77
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,960
take it back from them and restore what
was,

78
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,150
um,
that happened with the federalists in

79
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,810
1800 of that,
the natural unnatural as immigrants.

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,260
It happened in the 1850s with Irish
immigrants and you know,

81
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,860
Catholic immigrants and German Catholic
and Irish and German Catholic

82
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,750
immigrants.
And it's happening now.

83
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,640
Um,
something terrible has been taken away

84
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:34,150
and they're trying to bring it back.
It's appealing to people's fears.

85
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,640
They're appealing,
appealing to people's sense of,

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,300
um,
uh,

87
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,140
appealing to people's sense that they
are no longer,

88
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,920
they no longer count,
um,

89
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,780
these appealing to people's sense of
their,

90
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,810
their,
their resentments and grievances.

91
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,090
But we've seen that before as well.
I mean,

92
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,920
this isn't,
there's nothing new about any of this.

93
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,680
Interestingly,
it's usually a sign or it's been a sign

94
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:55,960
of a political party that's about the
cracked up.

95
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,840
Um,
and that certainly happened in 1800.

96
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:01,900
It happened in the 1850s,
in 1920s and thirties.

97
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,140
The,
uh,

98
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,000
the old guard and the Republican Party
that brought back the economics that led

99
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,720
to the Great Depression,
they too,

100
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,140
are being bought up by a resurgence of
nativism,

101
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,590
which led to a law in 1924 that grossly
destroy restricted immigration from

102
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,360
abroad.
In all three cases,

103
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,020
the parties either collect entirely or
they were marginalized.

104
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:27,460
The Republicans didn't elect a president
from Franklin Delano Roosevelt coming in

105
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:30,760
in 1932 until 30 years later.
And the,

106
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,601
the,
the,

107
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,740
um,
the president,

108
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:36,430
they elected in 1952,
Dwight Eisenhower basically ratified a

109
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,740
new deal consensus.
So,

110
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,320
so this,
this great,

111
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,470
I'm making America great again.
Usually means that a party's about to

112
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:45,370
get,
get under,

113
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,810
you know,
fall under great pressure.

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,100
Um,
it's going to,

115
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,770
if not collapsing target,
at least it's going to disintegrate or

116
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:51,970
be pushed to the margins.
