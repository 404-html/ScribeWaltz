1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,930
My contributions
just to,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,710
you know,
look at new technology products that

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,990
come along,
pick out what I do,

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,010
I think are the most interesting ones.
And try to tell a fairly large group of

5
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,410
readers whether I think they're worth
buying.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,930
I don't want to overinflate it.
That's what I do.

7
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,510
The other thing I do is I explain some
of these technologies.

8
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,550
Some of my comms are not product
reviews,

9
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:29,140
but they are,

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,980
uh,
uh,

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,480
planers about technology.
And then I,

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,900
a few times a year I do comms where I
take on broader issues like I,

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,030
you know,
attack the,

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,090
what I consider to be the excessive
control of the phone,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,030
wireless phone companies,
and I'll take them on.

16
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:49,660
And that gets me to be kind of
controversial for a few weeks,

17
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,070
you know.

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,903
Oh.
Um,

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,450
uh,

20
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,090
but that's my role.
I wouldn't,

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,340
I wouldn't,
uh,

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,740
uh,

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,670
you know,
inflated.

24
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,530
I'm a,
I'm a journalist.

25
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm a reviewer.

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,740
Uh,
I have,

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,713
uh,

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,310
thankfully I'm grateful for it.
I have a good,

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,770
large following.
And so,

30
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:10,431
uh,
uh,

31
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,830
I just help people sort through the,
uh,

32
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,860
the thicket of these technology options
they have.

33
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,630
But I don't invent technology.
I don't create technology

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,830
and I don't,
uh,

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,140
uh,
you know,

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,440
monetize technology.
I write about it.

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,131
Well,
I'm not going to,

38
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,580
cause I'm not going to buy into the idea
that I could make and break

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,030
people.
Obviously the Wall Street Journal is

40
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,460
widely read our websites and I'm now
all,

41
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,070
I'm now on many different websites,
syndicated,

42
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,510
uh,
uh,

43
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,980
I'm running my own with a partner,
Kara swisher website called the all

44
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,270
things d.
Dot com.

45
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,490
So I obviously,
because I have a lot of readers,

46
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,730
if I say this product is really good,
it helps them.

47
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:01,380
If I say it's really bad,
it hurts them.

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,150
But that's different than saying you can
make and break products.

49
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,510
I'm also not going to say I'm central to
the development.

50
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,790
I've never invented anything except a
co,

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,560
a column and a conference.
I've never been in any tech products.

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,980
But I think if you're asking me why have
I developed a following and been able to

53
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:25,860
retain a following,
which I do admit I have done,

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,680
I think it's because,
uh,

55
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,370
I've stayed true to the mission that I
proposed 16 years ago.

56
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,010
I don't,
I don't mean to be goofy about it,

57
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,520
but uh,
but sometimes the simple principles are

58
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,870
what works and I've just been laser
focused on,

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:43,930
okay,

60
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,910
a very specific but large audience,
which is non techies.

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,410
People who don't want to be techies,
people who have better things to do with

62
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,740
their time than tweaking these digital
devices.

63
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:00,520
They want them to work,
they want to enjoy them,

64
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,260
they want to use them.
They're not afraid of them.

65
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,570
They're not new to them.
They could be any age.

66
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,411
I mean,
you know,

67
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,050
if you're 16 and you have a lot of time
on your hands,

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,510
you may want to screw around with trying
to fix your windows when it breaks.

69
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,260
If you're the same person in your 25 and
you still are not afraid of the computer

70
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,120
and you have a lot of technical
knowledge,

71
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,330
you suddenly find you have a lot less
time on your hands to goof around with

72
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,220
it.
And so it isn't a question of being dumb

73
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,270
or smart or,
or intimidated or not intimidated.

74
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,750
It's a question of you bought,
you bought the laptop.

75
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,690
When you open it up,
you expect it to come on,

76
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,670
you expect it to connect to the Wifi
network,

77
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,970
you expect it to get you to the website,
you expect it to deal with your email,

78
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,430
expect to be able to play,
you know,

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,380
uh,
your favorite game on it.

80
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,620
You expect to be able to,
uh,

81
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,600
deal.
We'll do facebook and my space and at

82
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,730
the same time,
if you want to or need to,

83
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:58,880
you expect to be,
uh,

84
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,730
uh,
you know,

85
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,300
write a 50 page paper on it.
That's what they promise you when they

86
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,200
sell you the computer and they don't
promise you that you're going to be

87
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,590
spending your time dealing with
defragging,

88
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,591
the hard drive and you know,
updating the security program and all

89
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,380
that other stuff.
And so I have been laser focused on

90
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,750
that.
The first line of my first column was

91
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,740
personal computers are just too hard to
use and it's not your fault.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,500
And I still think that's true and I
think,

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,340
uh,
it's true for a cell phones,

94
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,670
which are like personal computers 10
years ago.

95
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,190
It's true for,
um,

96
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,040
most of these products.
So,

97
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,950
uh,
I think that's why I still have a

98
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,701
following.
I mean,

99
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:50,701
I'm in widely read print and web and
broadcast outlets,

100
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:55,930
but I also constantly have adopted that
voice.

101
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,710
Interesting.
