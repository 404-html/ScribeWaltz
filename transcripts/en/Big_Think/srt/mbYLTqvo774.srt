1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,020
Physics is about discovering with the
laws of nature are,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,180
and we've gotten some distance towards
that.

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:08,100
We're not done,
but we've gotten some good distance

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,140
towards that at the present time.
But once you know it,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,550
the laws of nature are another kind of
question unfolds itself,

6
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,040
which is why are those the laws and not
other laws.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,130
For example,
the laws that we understand,

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,360
the standard model of particle physics
describes all the fundamental particles.

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,090
They're interactions has about 30
numbers,

10
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,300
which you just have to put in as the
result of measuring them by experiment,

11
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,490
the masses of a different particles,
the quarks,

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,950
electrons,
neutrinos the strengths of the

13
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,200
fundamental forces,
various numbers like that.

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,270
And the model works dramatically well as
the recent experiments at the large

15
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:45,600
Hadron collider show,
why are those numbers,

16
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,470
what they are and our universe,
why is a massive the electron,

17
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,130
what it is and not 12 times larger,
half the size.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,450
There are dozens of questions like this.
So I developed cosmological natural

19
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:02,451
selection to try to give an evolutionary
account of this so that there would be a

20
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:06,030
history back before the big bang.
And we see these numbers could change

21
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:11,031
and evolve through a series of events
like the Big Bang and there could be an

22
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:16,491
explanation akin to natural selection.
Just like you want to know why do people

23
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:21,690
have two legs and not three legs or five
legs or four legs or six legs.

24
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:26,400
There's an evolutionary reason for that.
A certain kind of fitness has been

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,200
improved over many,
many generations and similarly that

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,500
could be a notion of fitness of the laws
of nature should approve or many

27
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,040
generations and cosmological natural
selection was an example of the theory

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,550
of that kind.
I realized that the only methodology we

29
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,850
hadn't science or the best methodology,
we had science for explaining how

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,800
choices having made the system true lead
to a lot of structure because one of the

31
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:57,270
mysteries is why our universe is so
structured as it is on so many scales

32
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,730
from organic molecules.

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,030
Bio Molecules are too vast.
Arrays of clusters of galaxies.

34
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:08,250
This enormous structure on such a wide
range of scales and that turns out to be

35
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:13,251
tied to the values of these constants of
the Standard Model of particle physics.

36
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,150
And so why is that?
And I realized that the only methodology

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,200
that was really successful for
explaining how choice were made in

38
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:25,860
nature such as to lead to an improbable
amount of structure is natural

39
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,290
selection.
So for natural selection,

40
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,100
we need reproduction.
And it was a hypothesis lying around

41
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:36,060
that universities reproduced through
black holes inside black holes,

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,910
rather than there being singularities
we're time ends.

43
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,550
There were the,
basically the bursts of new regions of

44
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,000
space and time,
which could become new universes.

45
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,570
And I took over that hypothesis and took
over the hypothesis that maybe the laws

46
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:52,440
of nature changed slightly,
which has been made by Johnny Wheeler in

47
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:57,441
the 1960s and just added a little bit,
which is that those changes should be

48
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:00,730
very small,
that there can be accumulation of

49
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:05,731
fitness leads to a prediction or an
observation that archer,

50
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,560
many,
many generations,

51
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,150
the population of universities should be
fine tuned to maximize the production of

52
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,990
black holes.

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,650
And that has further implications for
things that we can actually try to

54
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:22,651
measure and disprove experimentally.
So that's very briefly the idea of

55
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,750
cosmological natural selection.

56
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,400
Okay.
