1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,570
People are not fully rational and then
they do,

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,250
they make many choices that if they
reflected upon them they would do

3
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:17,460
differently.
There's no question about that and we

4
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,610
have a fair understanding actually of
what is happening,

5
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,050
at least at the individual level of my
senses that we have explored a lot of

6
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:27,240
what is happening.
I wouldn't say there's going to be no

7
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,580
further progress,
but we've explored in law,

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,210
um,
the major tendencies,

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,960
well the major tendencies to people tend
to frame things very narrowly.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,290
They take a narrow view of decision
makings.

11
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,430
They look at the problem at hand and
they deal with it as if it were the only

12
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:49,050
problem.
Very frequently.

13
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:54,051
It's a better idea to look at problems
as they will recur throughout your life

14
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:58,560
and then you look at the policy that you
to adopt for a class of problems.

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,410
Difficult to do would be a better thing.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,520
People frame things narrowly in the
sense,

17
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:10,521
for example,
they will save and borrow at the same

18
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:15,531
time instead of somehow treating their
whole portfolio of,

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,660
of assets as,
as one thing.

20
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,970
If people were able to take a broader
view,

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,580
they would in general make better
decisions.

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,870
So that is certainly one,
one of the weaknesses of human decision

23
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,240
making,
we call it narrow framing.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,320
Mental accounting,
you know,

25
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,090
is is a big deal.
This is the way that we live.

26
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,860
So we have,
we have,

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,730
we keep our money in different mental
accounts for which we have different

28
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:44,120
rules,
so people will,

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,470
well of course they spend,
they're spending money.

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,350
Um,
but then there is a hierarchy of the

31
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:53,520
accounts that they will touch.
They will spend money that they've

32
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,240
stalled for vacation,
what often before they will spend

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,260
whatever they're thinking of a savings
for their children's education.

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,210
So those are mental accounts for which
people have different rules more

35
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:10,830
foolishly versus pretty sensible because
mental accounting is a tool of self

36
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,680
control.
But more foolishly,

37
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:18,681
investors tend to view each stock that
they buy as a mental account and they

38
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,300
want to sell it,
uh,

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,430
when it is a winner.
And so they tend to sell their winners

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,540
and hang on to their losers in their
portfolio.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,870
And that turns out to make them
substantially poorer than if they had

42
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:37,770
done things differently.
And you need to be numerate for certain

43
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:41,790
kinds of decisions.
So numerous people have a significant

44
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:46,530
advantage over those who are not
understanding compounding compound

45
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:49,110
interest.
And it makes a huge difference whether

46
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,620
you're a credit card borrower or
somebody was saving.

47
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:57,621
People have a very hazy idea of compound
interest and,

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,540
and it's very,
so I would say that first of all you

49
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,950
need to be numerous that many people are
then,

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,110
then you need to frame things broadly.

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,950
I mean that's a,
it frequently goes with numeracy but

52
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,870
it's not quite the same thing.
Uh,

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,430
and then by taking the broad view,
it is very important not to have overly

54
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:28,111
strong emotional reactions to events.
And what I mean by that is that most of

55
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,990
us tend to respond to gains and two
losses,

56
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,040
two changes that happen in our life.
Actually,

57
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:41,041
you're better off if you frame things
broadly and you think you win a few,

58
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,250
lose a few,
and you have very limited emotional

59
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:50,251
response to small gains and two small
losses that tends to induce better

60
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:51,730
decision making.
