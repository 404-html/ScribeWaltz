1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,150
All systems of oppression are highly
adaptive and they can adapt to

2
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:12,990
challenges and incorporate them.
They can allow for exceptions.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,220
And I think the most effective
adaptation of the system of racism to

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:22,020
the challenges of the civil rights
movement was to reduce a racist to a

5
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,620
very simple formula.
A racist is an individual,

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,240
always an individual,
not a system who consciously does not

7
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:35,010
like people based on race must be
conscious and who intentionally seeks to

8
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:38,610
be mean to them.
Individual conscious intent.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,090
And if that is my definition of a
racist,

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,390
then your suggestion that anything I've
said or done is racist or has a racist

11
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,800
impact,
I'm going to hear that.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,170
As you just said,
I was a bad person.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,200
You just put me over there in that
category.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,920
And most of my bias anyway is
unconscious.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,380
So I,
I'm not intending,

16
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm not aware.

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,730
Uh,
so now I'm going to need to defend my

18
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,130
moral character and,
and I will,

19
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:12,090
and we've all seen it.
It seems to be virtually impossible

20
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:17,091
based on that definition for the average
white person to look deeply at their

21
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:21,240
socialization,
to look at the inevitability of

22
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:24,990
internalizing racist biases,
developing racist patterns,

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,400
and having investments in the system of
racism,

24
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,910
which is pretty comfortable for us and
serves us really well.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,240
I think that definition of a racist that
either,

26
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,960
or what I call the good,
bad binary is the root of virtually all

27
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,220
white defensiveness on this topic
because it makes it virtually impossible

28
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:49,221
to talk to the average white person
about the inevitable absorption of a

29
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:55,041
racist worldview that we get by being
literally swimming in racist water.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,690
So let me connect that to myself as a
result of being raised as a white person

31
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,680
in this society.

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,400
I have a racist world view,
I have deep racist biases,

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,320
I have developed a racist patterns and I
have investments in the system of racism

34
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,540
because it's,
it's served me really well.

35
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,650
It's comfortable.
It's helped me overcome the,

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,750
the barriers that I do face.
And I also have an investment and not

37
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:23,460
seeing any of that for what it would
suggest to me about my identity.

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,580
And what it would require of me.
Right?

39
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,290
I didn't choose any of that.
I don't feel guilty about it is an

40
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:35,700
inevitable result of being raised in
this society in which racism is the

41
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:40,020
bedrock.
The question of guilt comes in in,

42
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,560
what am I doing about that?
While we who are white tend to be

43
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,090
fragile in that it doesn't take much to
upset us around race.

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,860
The impact of our response is not
fragile at all.

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a kind of weaponized defensiveness,
weaponized,

46
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,830
hurt feelings,
right?

47
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,390
And it functions really,
really effectively to repel the

48
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,540
challenge.
You know,

49
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,770
as a white person,
I moved through the world racially

50
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,840
comfortable,
virtually 24 seven.

51
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,140
It is exceptional for me to be outside
of my racial comfort zone and most of my

52
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,500
life I've been warned not to go outside
my racial comfort zone.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
And so on the rare occasion when I am
uncomfortable racially,

54
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,710
it's,
it's a kind of throwing off of my racial

55
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,740
equilibrium and I need to get back into
that.

56
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,780
And so I will do whatever it takes to
repel the challenge and get back into

57
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,370
it.
And in that way,

58
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,320
I think white fragility functions as a
kind of white racial bullying.

59
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,410
To be frank,
we make it so miserable for people of

60
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:54,691
color to talk to us about are inevitable
and often unaware racist patterns that

61
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,110
we cannot help develop,
uh,

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,200
from being socialized into a culture in
which racism is the bedrock and the

63
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,034
foundation.

64
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,330
We make it so miserable for them to talk
to us about it that most of the time

65
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,880
they don't.
I mean,

66
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,880
it just mean we just have to understand
that most people of color that are

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,910
working or living in primarily white
environment take home way more daily

68
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,791
slights and hurts and insults than they
bother talking to us about

69
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,230
because their experiences,
they're going to risk more punishment.

70
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,400
They're going to lose the relationship.
They're going to have their experience

71
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,620
minimized,
explained away.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,030
They're going to cause the person to
feel attacked or hurt.

73
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,110
And in that way,
white fragility functions as a kind of

74
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:48,850
everyday white racial control.
None of that has to be intentional or

75
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,330
conscious,
but that is how it functions and it's

76
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:57,331
actually incredibly liberating and
transformative to start from the premise

77
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,330
that of course I've internalized all of
this and then I can stop defending,

78
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,840
deflecting,
denying,

79
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,080
hoping you won't notice,
minimize and explaining.

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,530
And I can just let go of that and get to
work.

81
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,190
And there's a question that's never
failed me in my efforts to unpack.

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,120
How do we pull this off?
How do so many of us who are white

83
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,150
individually feel so free of racism?
And yet we live in a society that is so

84
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:31,510
profoundly separate and unequal by race.
And the question that's never failed me

85
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,970
is not,
is this true or is this false?

86
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,830
Is this right?
Or is this wrong?

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,840
But how does it function?
How do these narratives that I tell,

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,620
how do they function when I tell you,
well,

89
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm just an individual.
Why can't we all just be individuals?

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,750
When I tell you I was taught to treat
everyone the same when I tell you,

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,620
but it's focusing on race that divides
us when I tell you,

92
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:01,621
but I have lots of friends of color.
Those narratives have not changed our

93
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:07,640
outcome,
and they function to take race off the

94
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:12,641
table and to exempt the person from any
further engagement and then doing that,

95
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,950
they function to protect the current
racial hierarchy in the white position

96
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,920
within it.
It doesn't have to be what I'm intending

97
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:25,610
to do,
but it is the impact of those

98
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,360
narratives.
