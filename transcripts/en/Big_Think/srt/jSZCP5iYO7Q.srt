1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,410
I'm not sure it says a lot.
Uh,

2
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:10,810
I think the Clinton years,
we're a,

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,790
we're a mistakes for America that they
took us in the wrong direction.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,370
I think President Bush has been a strong
leader,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
has stood up for improving education,
for improving our Medicare system and

6
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,890
standing up against a violet terror
throughout the world.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,630
Uh,
I respect the president and his

8
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,080
integrity.
