1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,070
A lot of people have talked about
China's growing role in Africa.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,130
I personally am not a particularly
either upset or surprised by this

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:17,381
because realistically what's going on is
simply the increased role that China is

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,570
playing in the globe at large,
uh,

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,450
as you would expect a growing economic
power,

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,470
uh,
to play,

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,310
uh,
and it's focused on resource plays.

8
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:36,311
It's focused on buying up and securing
energy sources and materials and various

9
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:41,120
things that will fuel the continued
growth of the Chinese economy.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,760
Uh,
and it's exactly what you'd expect.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,990
It certainly has some adverse
consequences because since the Chinese

12
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:52,910
don't care about various kinds of human
rights issues and they don't care about

13
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:55,580
political freedoms,
they're more than happy to deal with

14
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:58,580
dictators.
They're more than happy to overlook all

15
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:03,410
sorts of trouble if it,
if there are particular immediate needs

16
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,390
are taken care of,
but you know what,

17
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:08,420
in the long run,
the Chinese might well find that

18
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:13,421
stability and sustainably healthy,
viable local communities and,

19
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,850
and policies are in their best interest
as well.
