1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,940
Look simple,
doesn't it?

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,720
When you're dealing with a master of
slight of hand,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,450
like my partner teller,
even the simplest activity may be a

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,300
complex deception.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,300
Tell number fascinated by how stupid
magic is.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,460
That magic is going through all these
elaborate machinations to make something

7
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:30,461
look one way that's really another and
instruct us is really funny to do a

8
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:35,711
magic trick that accomplished reality.
Tell her needs nothing but a pencil,

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,580
one lit cigarette and a flashlight.
Let's watch that original routine again.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,350
But this time from the other side and we
went through many,

11
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,330
many things.
We were going to originally do it with

12
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:57,230
cooking or something like that,
but after weeks of trying to write this

13
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:59,810
bit,
we came up with the idea of how about

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,370
uh,
taking out a cigarette,

15
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:04,220
lighting it,
putting a cigarette out and then pulling

16
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:08,120
out another cigarette and lighting it.
How about if we did that trick exactly

17
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:13,121
like that with all accomplished by
trickery stuff you could do simply.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,050
And that seemed to have such a,
um,

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,000
purely existential field to us,
uh,

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,190
going through incredibly complicated
machinations to get to a very simple end

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,580
simulates a line liner when the
flashlight was the,

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,980
let's take a red pencil and the cover of
misdirection from the flashlight.
