1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,140
Hearing a lot about the Internet of
things,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,320
how your many,
many devices are becoming networked

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,840
computers and many of these devices are
you know,

4
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:14,410
$10 thing that you buy and you put on
your shelf and you have it for year and

5
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,940
you throw it away.
Um,

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,070
I think not a lot of attention is being
played,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
paid to the security of those kinds of
devices and some sense of the companies

8
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,590
that are making them can't afford to do
it.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,683
Um,
but they,

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,950
they can leave longstanding
vulnerabilities.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,350
The automotive industry is another
interesting example.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,660
A typical American modern automobile.
How somewhere between 30 and a hundred

13
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,400
would have called embedded control
units,

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,500
but in better control unit is just a
computer.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,220
Some of them are very,
very small and run very simple code.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,570
A native on the hardware.
Some of them are full blown linux

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,910
computers or,
or windows computers and they are

18
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:49,744
networked.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,440
A modern car has four to five network
connections where the code,

20
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:58,060
the computers on the car talked to
computers outside of the car.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,390
So an example is there's a bluetooth
connection so that your cell phone can

22
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:05,290
talk to the car so that you can play
your music from your phone on the car or

23
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,120
you can talk on the cell phone without
having,

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,750
you're having to use your hands.
There's also a telematics unit,

25
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,810
which is the thing that um,
if you get in an accident,

26
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:17,770
we'll arrange to call nine one one or
have the paramedics come that that

27
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,540
service,
which is really useful and very,

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,850
uh,
it's a great safety feature means that

29
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:25,960
your car has a cell phone number and
that it's possible to communicate with

30
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,060
your car over that cell phone
connection.

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,490
Hackers can use those network
connections to remotely break in to the

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,290
computer system that's on your car and
white hat hackers have shown they can do

33
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,440
that and then they can then rewrite any
of the software on the car,

34
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:45,250
replaced the code that was legitimately
put there by the car manufacturer with

35
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,960
whatever code they want to have there.

36
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,820
And a typical,
uh,

37
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,900
you know,
modern car,

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,020
pretty much all of the functionality of
the car is now controlled by software.

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,230
So breaking is controlled site by
software because you really want to have

40
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,330
antilock braking steer,
um,

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,060
uh,
acceleration is controlled by software

42
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,690
because of cruise control and when you
like you really want to have a car that

43
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:09,010
can park parallel parking for you.
That means steering is under software

44
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,110
control.
The locks are under software control so

45
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,750
you can push the key fob button and have
your locks open.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,090
Uh,
essentially all of the functionality of

47
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,100
cars or under software control.
And for the most part,

48
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:20,800
that's a really good thing.
Having it be under software control

49
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,230
means that you can get increased
functionality,

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,700
you can have improved safety features,
you can get upgrades as the car

51
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,440
companies figured out how to do things
better.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,880
All of that's really good.

53
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,280
Um,
the downside is that because it's

54
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:36,130
controlled by software,
if an attacker can come in and replace

55
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:38,620
that software,
then they can control the braking and

56
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:42,130
the acceleration and the locks and
everything that it was under software

57
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,650
control.
So we're starting to see theft rings,

58
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,780
for example,
that are using electronic hacking in

59
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:51,160
order to steal cars more easily.
Lloyd's of London recently stopped

60
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:55,210
insuring land rovers in England unless
the land rovers where garaged in a

61
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,480
locked facility because they were being
stolen too frequently.

62
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,930
So that's the kind of state of the art
of the automotive industry.

63
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,800
The question is,
well,

64
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,801
why isn't it better?
So one starting point is it's really

65
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,870
hard to get good security.
You have to do tons of things right.

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,190
It costs money.
So the car industry could improve the

67
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,010
security of their cars and hopefully
they will eventually,

68
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,770
um,
that improvement will cost them money.

69
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,830
And the car industry doesn't have huge
profit margins.

70
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,910
They can't really afford to invest in
the security unless they can recoup the

71
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:32,740
costs associated with that investment by
passing the cost onto the consumer.

72
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,320
So that means the price of the car is
going to be higher.

73
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,440
Um,
so then why is the consumer going to go

74
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,200
buy the car?
That's more than the equivalent car from

75
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,380
a different manufacturer will typically
the answers while you do advertising,

76
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:48,790
you explain to the consumer why they're
getting more value for this extra cost.

77
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,570
The problem is if you,
if you imagine car company,

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,220
a car company starting a ad campaign to
explain their car is more cyber secure.

79
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,500
Most consumers these days probably think
their car was already cybersecurity.

80
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,950
They didn't realize that their car could
be hacked into.

81
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,270
So the result of such an advertising
campaign could in fact be to make people

82
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,380
afraid to buy any new car whatsoever
rather than causing them to buy a

83
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,340
particular car.

84
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,150
So I think an advertising approach to
motivating consumers to pay slightly

85
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:20,290
more for a particular car is not really
viable.

86
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,230
So that means all of the cars have to
have,

87
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,540
like basically all of the companies have
to do it at the same time.

88
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,330
They all have to do this extra
investment that basically if the price

89
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,450
of old cars goes up by a little bit,
then there's no longer this

90
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,750
differentiation between manufacturers
and consumers would be choosing between

91
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,210
cars that all have roughly the same
level of security.

92
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,210
Um,
going back just a bit,

93
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:44,470
another reason why the car companies
can't advertise on the security is

94
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,100
suppose one car company actually did go
and invest a ton in making their cars

95
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,340
more secure and then they advertise
their car was more secure.

96
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,240
That's kind of a painting,
a big target on your back as far as the

97
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,620
hacker community is concerned.

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,320
Certain uh,
individuals would take that as a

99
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:01,600
challenge and they would go like they
would,

100
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,300
you sort of get some number of
credibility for hacking into any car.

101
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,570
But if you hack into the car that is
from the company that is advertising

102
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:11,260
that their cars are secure,
you get way more credibility if they

103
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,420
find a vulnerability and then publish
it.

104
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,070
That car all of a sudden has less,
is less secure than the other cars that

105
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:19,840
might actually have more
vulnerabilities,

106
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:24,430
but no one has discovered it because the
vulnerability is public and people know

107
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,490
it exists and therefore can exploit it.
So it's this weird situation where

108
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,630
although the car in some absolute sense
is more secure in a practical sense,

109
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,330
it's less secure because there's a
publicly known vulnerability.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,400
So advertising is bad both because it
could scare away consumers entirely and

111
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:42,310
they could direct hackers to your
specific car,

112
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,260
decreasing the security of that car.

113
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,850
And uh,
as a result.

114
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,130
So we're left with how do you get sort
of the car industry as a whole to

115
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:55,690
produce more secure cars and that
requires some kind of external

116
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,280
motivation.
They might decide to do it because it's

117
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:01,700
just the right thing to do.
Typically companies are motivated by

118
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,930
financial reasons,
not,

119
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,440
they usually can't afford to do things
just because of the right thing to do.

120
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,140
Um,
in terms of outside forces,

121
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,730
uh,
one outside force would be government

122
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:15,050
regulation.
So cars many years ago were very unsafe,

123
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,750
right?
Ralph Nader wrote famously unsafe at any

124
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,100
speed,
not prompted,

125
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
uh,
federal regulations.

126
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,210
There's the five star safety crash
rating,

127
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,040
a system,
for example,

128
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:29,330
that that created a regime where cars
were tested for their safety and given

129
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:32,510
scores and consumers could then use
those scores and making their decisions.

130
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,190
I think creating such a regime in the
current political climate is unlikely.

131
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,370
Um,
another possibility is the insurance

132
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:43,280
company might,
the insurance industry might start to

133
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,930
impose,
put pressure,

134
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,650
financial pressure on car industry.
We saw that with the Lloyd's of London

135
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,120
refusing to ensure land rovers that
weren't garaged in locked facilities

136
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,440
because of electronic theft,
that if the insurance companies start to

137
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,680
notice that certain kinds of cars are
getting hacked into with negative

138
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:05,060
consequences for theft or for accidents,
they might increase the insurance

139
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,700
premiums on that particular brand and
those insurance premium is,

140
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:12,110
might then drive consumers to cars that
don't have those characteristics and

141
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:15,110
that might then motivate the car
industry to improve the security.

142
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:18,350
That's kind of a long chain,
but at the moment I think that's my best

143
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:22,280
guess as to how we'll get better
cybersecurity and in our cars.

144
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,780
But I think the car industry is in some
sense representative of many other

145
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,390
industries.
So like medical devices or another

146
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,970
domain,
things like pacemakers and insulin

147
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,420
pumps.

148
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,070
They are relatively simple computer
systems that are networked to other

149
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,410
computers.
Like it makes sense for a pacemaker to

150
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:43,160
have a wifi device so a doctor can
monitor how the heart's you doing.

151
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,420
But once you have that wifi connection,
a hacker can use it to go in and modify

152
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:50,990
the code and the pacemaker.
There are basically lots of examples of

153
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:55,040
industries where things that previously
weren't computers at all are now not

154
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,900
only computers where their networks,
computers,

155
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:01,220
and over time those industries will need
to accept that their network computers

156
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:04,880
and start to apply security techniques
so that the systems are,

157
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,020
are more secure.
