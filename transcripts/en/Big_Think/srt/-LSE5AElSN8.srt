1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Technology is no longer something that's
just restricted to large companies or

2
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:10,470
large countries or even rich countries.
So everywhere,

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,960
uh,
on the planet and now as access,

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:14,190
you know,
at least has the potential to have

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,090
access to technology.
People in developing economies often own

6
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:21,840
smart phones and technologies at
equivalent rates to people in the

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,190
developed world.
Uh,

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,810
in fact,
quite often they'll have that before

9
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:29,190
they even have sanitation in some cases.
So the p the pervasive nature of

10
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,980
technology is one of the most important
features of it.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,030
The other important features,
just the rate and pace that rich a

12
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,640
adoption is actually occurring.
Uh,

13
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:40,980
just to put some comparative numbers on
this,

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,360
if you think about television,
it took something like 38 years before

15
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,390
television.
Penate penetration got to the first 50

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,560
million people.
Uh,

17
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:53,100
it took twitter nine months.
Uh,

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,720
so just the rate of acceleration or
reach adoption occurs.

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,830
It's pretty phenomenal.
Uh,

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,600
the,
and then the other feature that becomes

21
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:04,740
very interesting about technology is not
just its pace and scale and the rate of

22
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:08,010
innovation,
but the economic aspects of technology.

23
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:13,011
So when you have things in digital form
that actually has a profound impact on

24
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,370
how it affects the economics of things.
So digital technologies have this

25
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,570
feature,
uh,

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,160
that,
that,

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,270
you know,
economists think of it as the nun

28
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:23,640
rivalry and not exclude excluded ability
of it.

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,750
What that means is that my use of
something that's in digital form doesn't

30
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:32,130
necessarily as a physical,
Technological Matta preclude your use of

31
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,980
it.
The good news about that is that from a

32
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,510
user standpoint,
this is all good because it's what

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,680
economists talk about it as consumer
surplus.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,570
So the fact that he doesn't cost us that
much more to get access to information

35
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:49,380
where there's educational material and
attainment material,

36
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,550
uh,
that's all good for us is as,

37
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:55,080
as consumers,
I think it puts you challenges for

38
00:01:55,081 --> 00:02:00,081
companies because now you have to think
about how do you generate revenues and

39
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:01,890
monetize this.

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,200
We've seen how technology has caused,
you know,

41
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,030
with these marginal costs,
economics,

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,590
disruptions in many,
many,

43
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,150
many,
many industries where this,

44
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,640
the media world,
the entertainment world.

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,040
So it has these disruptive effects,
but for users is generally good in the

46
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,840
sense that it's all,
you know,

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,610
useful information that you get the
investments in,

48
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:26,010
in technology,
infrastructure and technology assets is

49
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:30,360
now pervasive across every sector.
Whether it's we're talking health care

50
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,040
or we're talking,
uh,

51
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,810
the public sector or talking about
education or we talk about industrial.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,120
In fact,
one of the more exciting things about in

53
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:43,530
the industrial area arena is what
everybody now refers to as the Internet

54
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:48,531
of things that for the first time we're
now going to be connecting a machines,

55
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,490
centers,
physical things of any sort a that we

56
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,050
like.
I think that's going to have a huge and

57
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:58,200
profound impact.
So think about all the machine to

58
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,790
machine interactions.

59
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,840
Think about the possibility for how we
manage our use of energy,

60
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,140
how we manage our homes,
how we manage these settings with as to

61
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:10,030
workspace,
the Ha the home,

62
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,050
the car when machines and things get in,
get connected.

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,410
What I find interesting about that in
particular is what that does to a

64
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,510
questions about industry structure and
competition.

65
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,450
I think we always just imagined that,
uh,

66
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,690
you know,
companies would compete within their

67
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,730
sectors.
Uh,

68
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,010
so this idea of these sectors made sense
at some point.

69
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,610
But when you have technology and
technology base to assets,

70
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,850
I think it becomes possible to enter
many,

71
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,790
many sectors on the base of technology
platforms.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,050
Think about the fact that now we're
talking about Amazon as a computing

73
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,980
company,
uh,

74
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,500
through their cloud services.
Think about the fact that you now have

75
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:54,760
alibaba applying for banking licenses.
Think about the fact that some of the

76
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,720
most profound,
uh,

77
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,490
innovations and transportations are
being done by technology,

78
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,290
Internet companies,
Google and others.

79
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,850
So I think when,
you know,

80
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:07,000
one of the things that happens to
technology makes it possible for

81
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,590
participants in competition to come from
often outside the sector.

82
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,140
So that's one big change to industry
structure.

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,950
Another big change,
the industry structure is on the k on

84
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,780
the question of what it takes to
compete.

85
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,400
So you're now going to see many,
many small companies be able to have

86
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:29,401
kind of the power and the access and the
potential to disrupt sectors that

87
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,530
historically you'd have associated with
just large companies.

88
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,400
So this idea of competition coming from
outside the sector,

89
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,850
outside of the geography,
and very often from much smaller

90
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,800
companies,
I think it's going to have a profound

91
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,440
impact on the structure of industries in
the economy.
