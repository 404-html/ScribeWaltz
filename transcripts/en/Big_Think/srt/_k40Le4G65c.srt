1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,700
Oh,
yours are that we will not get our,

2
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:14,534
uh,
uh,

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,770
environment under control.
The barriers are that,

4
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:19,490
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,250
I saw a very interesting film,
a few,

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,980
it was on a French television program.
It would be showing,

7
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,840
some people come up,
uh,

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,703
from,
uh,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,020
uh,
they had been nomads in the south,

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,860
uh,
part of the desert in western Africa.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,140
And there was a fishing season and they
arrived in trucks and they,

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,290
thousands of them went out and we were
catching these fish.

13
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,050
And pretty soon there were no fish left.
That was the point of the film.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,810
And the real point of the film is,
well,

15
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:51,350
there aren't gonna be any fish lab.
But the message was,

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,500
what are they supposed to do?
What are they supposed to do?

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,930
There isn't work for them where they
started,

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,400
uh,
they have to eat.

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,680
And so they come up and they take the
fish.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,760
Well,
this is a huge problem and we know that

21
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:07,760
on the one hand,
we've got to keep the fish and we also

22
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:11,660
have to find work for the paper.
And so that's the kind of problem that's

23
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:13,760
posed.
Tremendous environmental problems,

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,410
tremendous population problems,
uh,

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,470
tremendous problems,
of course,

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,350
of keeping the,
what I'd call the fanatical,

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,530
dark element of human nature under
control.

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,360
And it only takes a few where it's out
of control to do tremendous damage.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,230
But we have terrific instruments of
cooperation.

30
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,560
The Internet being one,
our educational institutions,

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,480
uh,
our economy is good.

32
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,220
We have this economic means,
so forces of points of light and

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,390
possibilities of,

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:46,810
okay.
