1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,430
I changed the world everyday.
I am an agent of change,

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,870
uh,
and hopefully positive change and that's

3
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,940
the way I view my work.
Uh,

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,440
when I say I changed the world every 
day,

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,950
well,
how do we try to ensure that no child in

6
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:32,934
America goes to sleep at night,
worried that they don't have healthcare 

7
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,110
coverage,
uh,

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,660
and cannot get ill.
Uh,

9
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:47,661
how do we ensure that every kids,
God given potential is fulfilled?

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,343
How do we use the power of our 
collective intellect as a more powerful 

11
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,214
tool than the power of our bombs?
And how do we do it in a way that 

12
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,160
promotes democracy and human rights 
across the world?

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,553
Um,
and how do we take American ingenuity 

14
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,460
and turn it for good in other parts in 
the world?

15
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,570
So,
uh,

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
what I get to do is work out everyday at
changing the world,

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,800
being part of changing the course of 
events,

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,930
of being able to make the wind that 
blows over our people,

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,440
blow a lot more gently.
Uh,

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,460
and at the end of the day,
I'm moving in a direction that,

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,323
uh,
says to me personally that I have left 

22
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,360
the world a better off today than it was
yesterday.

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,523
Well,
change isn't always easy and it doesn't 

24
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:51,060
always happen.
And sometimes I wonder,

25
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,420
did I leave the world better off today 
than it was yesterday?

26
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,760
Uh,
but,

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,683
uh,
but bringing people together in common 

28
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:01,944
cause is a great challenge.
Also great opportunity to do great 

29
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,480
things.
Um,

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,013
and obviously that's a,
that's a struggle because we don't all 

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,110
come from the same experiences,
come from the same backgrounds,

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,123
look at everything the same way even 
when sometimes we believe in a common 

33
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,970
goal,
but we have different views as to how we

34
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,770
achieve them.
And so,

35
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,120
uh,
that's a struggle.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,820
It's a struggle from someone who grew up
poor,

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,163
uh,
to be in an institution which getting 

38
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,570
there often,
uh,

39
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,240
requires,
uh,

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,210
for example,
raising money,

41
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,350
uh,
to,

42
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,263
uh,
expanding very expensive elections in 

43
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:54,220
media markets that are very expensive so
that you can get your message so that of

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,073
what you want to do so that you can be 
elected to then do the things that will 

45
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,670
change the course of events.
And,

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,410
and that's,
that's a struggle.

47
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,670
Hi.
I think I'm best known for,

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,190
um,

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,150
trying to give Hispanic Americans a 
place at the table,

50
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,470
particularly as it relates to a,

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,250
um,

52
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,510
being part of the political space in our
country.

53
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,930
Uh,
empowering seeking to empower Latino's,

54
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,530
which I've done from my home state of 
New Jersey,

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,150
had been involved with nationally,
uh,

56
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,980
and also riveting attention,
uh,

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,240
within the fastest part of America's 
population growth and the largest single

58
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:47,020
minority that there is a great 
potential,

59
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,670
not just for that community itself,
but for the broader American community.

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,290
Um,
this is a community that is a younger by

61
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,970
a decade and the rest of the population,
uh,

62
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,870
and so as the nation grays and grows 
older,

63
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,183
it will increasingly look to members of 
this community within the American 

64
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:11,701
family for the quality of their lives.
Some of us will be washing a surgeons,

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,950
I mean a,
a kitchen knife in a,

66
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,570
uh,
in a restaurant.

67
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,500
And another one of us will be holding a 
surgeon's knife in an operating room and

68
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,334
how well educated and trained that 
individual will be will be increasingly 

69
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:27,220
important to those who are going to be 
his or her patients.

70
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,600
And so if we are younger by a decade,
uh,

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,553
and uh,
going to be about 25 percent of all of 

72
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,260
the nations schoolchildren within the 
next 20 years,

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,620
it means the educational future of the 
nation is also at stake in large part to

74
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,640
this community.
Uh,

75
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,474
and so how well educated that a part of 
American society is going to be 

76
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,910
important for the nations competitive 
future.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,180
So having Hispanic Americans play a 
significant role in having policy issues

78
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,210
that affect the quality of their lives,
that in return,

79
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,830
therefore,
the quality of opportunity in America is

80
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:08,560
something that I think that not only 
have I been doing,

81
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:13,120
but that I am known for in terms of part
of my work.

82
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,660
It would be that,
uh,

83
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,470
it is a sleeping giant that I think is 
about to awaken and needs to wake up and

84
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:30,814
needs to wake up by using its electoral 
power in a way that can decide the 

85
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,150
course of events,
uh,

86
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,540
immediately in our country.
And for the longterm,

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,433
I think the community has a 
transformational opportunity to change 

88
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,230
and impact not only,
for example,

89
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,540
who the next president of the United 
States will be,

90
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,350
which in and of itself will be 
significant.

91
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,573
But where public policy will head when 
you have 17 million Latinos in the 

92
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,860
country,
uh,

93
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,753
who are eligible to vote.
And when you see where they're located 

94
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,440
in the states that are critical for an 
electoral victory,

95
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,540
for the next president of the United 
States,

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,400
you have an opportunity,
uh,

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,510
to have a transformational change by the
use of your power,

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,583
our challenge,
my message to the community that would 

99
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,224
be,
you've got to use that power because 

100
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:32,360
that power ultimately comes back in the 
things that you care about,

101
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,020
for the future of your family,
for the future of the community that you

102
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,854
live in,
the nation that you call your own 

103
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,770
Giotto,
Latina decade,

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,890
a dealing room,
bullet in life,

105
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,733
Doria that allow both the full tool,
that device in a bladed that acc at the 

106
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,940
median is the baton.

107
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,550
This gang,
the moment to voiding the city kimball,

108
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,010
Proximo,
presidente battle,

109
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,710
the Wallace sloppily,
Deca,

110
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:15,460
Domestica,
internacional.

111
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,530
They get pulled a muscle or rather 
lacking,

112
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,403
get to the.

113
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,353
And I want to maintain a point instead 
of the city though for the looser than 

114
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,970
northrop audit,
Elo Unico embedding to it,

115
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,750
but is to trump material and acquire 
good parents like the name of etc.

116
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,060
It a solid support that focus you have,
someone has supported,

117
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,340
considered below hit have club,
but a proximal president for them,

118
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,800
but he wound up political domestica do 
this,

119
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,093
evaporated fairly sudden news,
very different in the house of 

120
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,260
representatives and institution of 435 
people that is incredibly diverse.

121
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,850
Uh,
gettIng uh,

122
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,410
enough people in common cause 218 people
to pass anything is a real challenge.

123
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,300
But particularly,
uh,

124
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,410
one of the big differences between the 
house and the senate as if you're in the

125
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:36,411
house of representatives and if you 
happen to be in the minority party,

126
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:41,190
whenever that might be,
whether it's republicans or democrats in

127
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,024
the past,
it's almost an abject minority because 

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,513
the rules of the house control the 
process in such a way that the majority 

129
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,294
largely controls everything primarily 
through a traffic cop call that rules 

130
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:54,990
committee.

131
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,730
And in doing so,
that committee,

132
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,280
which is a super majority of the 
majority of controls,

133
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:02,670
what gets to the floor of the house of 
representatives under what way?

134
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,490
It's debated how much time,
what amendments and all that.

135
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,690
So,
and,

136
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,543
and it can even change the legislation 
that you may have gotten out of another 

137
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,570
committee that,
uh,

138
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,230
ultimately comes before the rules 
committee.

139
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,240
The rules committee can say,
you know what,

140
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,480
we're going to rewrite this bill and 
we're going to send it to the floor in a

141
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:22,500
different way.
so in the house of representatives,

142
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,633
not only is getting common cause and 
much more difficult challenge because 

143
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:27,534
you knew 218 votes,
but you also have the differences 

144
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,214
between a majority and a minority with 
the minority facing enormous hurdles to 

145
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:42,471
have its views or propositions be voted 
on in the United States senate.

146
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,570
Not only of course is that a smaller 
institution,

147
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,404
100 members,
but the power is given to an individual 

148
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:54,030
senator can make a minority senator,
uh,

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,940
one in which they play a majority role.

150
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,170
Uh,
and because there is no traffic cop,

151
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,004
the rules committee and so much moves in
the senate by what we call unanimous 

152
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,384
consent,
which just means that there has to be 

153
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,680
unanimity among 100 members to let 
something move forward.

154
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,723
And one senator can get up and object.
And I had an early experience of that 

155
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:15,804
upon coming to the senate where there 
was a legislation in the final days of 

156
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:21,054
the republican senate in 2006 that 
wanted to change and authorize a Ryan 

157
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,480
White funding,
which is important about aids prevention

158
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:31,314
and,
uh,

159
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,240
uh,
and the,

160
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,293
how we help the hiv affected community.
And it was going to be done in such a 

161
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:40,680
way that clearly would have hurt my 
state of New Jersey,

162
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,553
uh,
in ways that I could not tolerate on 

163
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:47,310
behalf of that community.
And it was my power then as a minor part

164
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,080
of the minority power party.

165
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,273
But as an individual senator to say I 
object and by my objections stopping a 

166
00:10:56,161 --> 00:11:01,161
process that until a negotiation took 
place with me that changed the course of

167
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:02,664
events at made that legislation in its 
reauthorization far more acceptable to 

168
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,400
those people who have suffered with hiv 
aids in my home state of New Jersey.

169
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,234
And it's an example of how even a,
a member of the minority party in the 

170
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,324
senate can have a disproportionate 
opportunity to affect the course of 

171
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,780
events than a minority member of the 
house.

172
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:25,614
Of representatives,
maybe not as many as I'd like since it 

173
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:39,460
is one of those books that inspire me.
Uh,

174
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,540
but there are moments,
there are moments.

175
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,793
I think there are moments,
people who are the party of the 

176
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:50,940
president and are willing to buck the 
president.

177
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,230
Uh,
and that is,

178
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,960
I think a,
a,

179
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,003
a profile encouraged.
There are those people who are willing 

180
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,823
to speak out against a,
what might be seen as the popular view 

181
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,740
in a country or among their colleagues.

182
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,730
And I know last year I know I was only 
one of 12 members,

183
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,820
uh,
to vote to transition out of Iraq,

184
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,540
uh,
out of 100 member body and,

185
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,250
uh,
you know,

186
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,450
um,
for a lot of,

187
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,710
uh,
uh,

188
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,620
those individuals,
uh,

189
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,350
that was not an easy choice,
but they felt it was the right choice.

190
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,200
Um,
and so there are moments of that,

191
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,543
you know,
um,

192
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,720
uh,
uh,

193
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,500
I think though that,
um,

194
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,950
to say what is one person's profile 
encourage,

195
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,183
uh,
may not be seen as significant as 

196
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:50,921
another's.
But,

197
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:52,290
uh,
um,

198
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,020
I think passage from profiles and 
courage that speaks to this is a,

199
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,190
in a prologue which says,
in whatever arena of life what meets the

200
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:03,730
challenge of courage,
no matter the sacrifices they face,

201
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:07,150
if they follow their conscience,
the loss of their friends,

202
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,040
their fortune,
their contentment,

203
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,933
even the esteem of their fellow man,
each person must decide for themselves 

204
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,063
the course they will follow,
the stories of past courage they can 

205
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:19,900
teach,
they can offer hope,

206
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,003
they can provide inspiration,
but they cannot provide courage itself 

207
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,503
for this.
Each person must look into their own 

208
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:27,994
soul.
And I think there are members of the 

209
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,100
senate in their own ways on different 
issues who,

210
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,934
uh,
from time to time look into their own 

211
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:38,980
soul and act in a way that is 
courageous.
