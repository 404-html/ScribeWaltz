1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,860
Well,
it's a difficult challenge to figure out

2
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:17,180
now what to do with this information
from the mind sciences.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,240
My prediction is that legal theory is
going to be in legal.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,990
Cirrus in the law are going to be
focused on this and struggling with this

5
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:32,780
and entangled in these difficult
questions going forward for,

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,780
for who knows how long.
One of the,

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,460
um,
one of the things to be aware of is that

8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,490
in every area of law there exist a place
where the law and legal decision makers

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,640
recognize the power of situation.
And when they do the law changes the

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,630
outcome of the law changes.
So I teach tort law for example,

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,910
and we are,
uh,

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,350
we are in tort law,
very prone to say that people assumed

13
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:08,330
the risk that they made choices and
therefore they should bear the

14
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,470
consequences.
Um,

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,470
and we are also inclined not to allow
there to be liability,

16
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,970
um,
uh,

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,690
where we think the parties could have
contract.

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,950
So we say,
look,

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,990
if if you use someone else's stuff and
you could have gained consent and you

20
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,970
didn't,
you're going to have to pay.

21
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:31,820
We may have to put you in jail.
We call this sort of property rule

22
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:32,654
protection.

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,670
Well,
there are times when we say that doesn't

24
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:40,220
apply,
that the situation actually played a

25
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:44,780
role that doesn't typically play a role.
And so now we're going to adjust the

26
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,580
law.
I'm an example,

27
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,630
a famous example in tort law is,
um,

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,790
is the case of,
uh,

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,110
of,
uh,

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,030
a family out on a,
on a boat,

31
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,390
on a lake.
In a sudden storm comes up and now this

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,290
family is stuck in the middle of the
like and they need to get somewhere for

33
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,980
safety.
They see a doc and they approached the

34
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:05,810
dock,
they tried to get on it and they're

35
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:09,470
pushed off right.
And now as a consequence of the person

36
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,830
on the dock pushing them off something
that,

37
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:16,831
that the person is generally entitled to
do because of it's their property.

38
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:21,530
So property rule protection,
the boat slams against the shore,

39
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,540
it's damaged and some of the people are
injured.

40
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,500
So that's at least a variation of a,
of an actual,

41
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,050
of an actual case.
A tort law,

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,200
uh,
recognizes that in those situations

43
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:37,190
where a storm comes up and people are
looking to protect their lives,

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,700
that it's not exactly their disposition
that's leading them.

45
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,750
It's more their situation to our law
says then that you're permitted to use

46
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,700
someone else's doc.
Um,

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,960
and that if they do try to push you off,
they're going to have to compensate you

48
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:54,020
for the consequences.
So there's an example of where the law

49
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,230
is,
is adjusted to take situation into

50
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:59,530
account.
I could take you through every of law.

51
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,520
I won't,
uh,

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,500
in part because I don't know them all.
But if I did,

53
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:05,510
I would take you through all of them and
show you that in every area of law there

54
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:09,700
is a place where situation comes in.
And so the law has already struggled

55
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,060
with this.

56
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,230
It's just particulate picked a
particular sort of dividing line.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,590
Um,
so in contract law we say if someone

58
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:21,340
puts a gun to your head and says you're
your money or your life and you give

59
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,770
your wallet,
that's not an enforceable contract.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,170
He wasn't your disposition that led you
to do it.

61
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,230
It was your situation.
And so we changed the law to reflect it.

62
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,170
I think one a general way in which the
law is going to have to deal with this.

63
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,220
It's going to have to slide a slide.
The sort of the dividing point between

64
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,780
wind situation matters and when
disposition matters.

65
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,020
Um,
and that's going to be difficult because

66
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:51,190
there is some simplicity and um,
um,

67
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,120
and there's something affirming about
the idea that if something bad has

68
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,970
happened to someone,
it's because they chose it.

69
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,470
So there will be resistance to this.
But I think that the mind sciences are

70
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:06,700
going to appeal to those who are
committed to kind of a truth,

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,393
uh,
to,

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,770
um,
to expand those circumstances in which

73
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,840
we take s situation seriously.

74
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,630
Now,
if you do that and you begin thinking

75
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,330
about problems like crime,
um,

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,610
this doesn't mean that you're suddenly
saying,

77
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,550
well,
because criminal behavior was

78
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:27,640
situationally cause we should set all
the criminals free.

79
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,190
It's actually much more complicated than
that,

80
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,930
but it,
but its implications,

81
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,450
um,
can be quite concrete.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,940
So one thing it might do is it might
suggest to you that if criminals behaved

83
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:44,140
a certain way,
it's not a solution to changing that

84
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:49,120
behavior simply to say that those people
should be put behind bars because if

85
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,780
they are indeed moved by situation,
and we might look at a number of

86
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,240
situational factors,
but some of the classics that already

87
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:59,530
come to mind are things like poverty and
hunger that might lead people to behave

88
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:03,040
in criminal ways that we're not going to
change that behavior if we attribute

89
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,670
what they did simply to their
dispositions and miss the fact that they

90
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,490
were operating in an environment which
would lead many people,

91
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,010
including perhaps ourselves to behave
the same way.

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,240
So it's focus on behavior,
uh,

93
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,300
kind of an instrumentalist view of law.
Asking how can we change what people do

94
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,900
that might lead us to change how we
respond to criminal behavior to be sure

95
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,340
we may put people behind bars,
but behind bars we may be less likely to

96
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:34,420
say they are of a certain character and
therefore we just make them do their

97
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,860
time.
There's nothing we can do.

98
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,910
Maybe we can change their situation
behind bars and maybe we can change the

99
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,150
situation of people who are not behind
bars to lead,

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,530
uh,
to lead others,

101
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,620
to engage in less of that kind of
conduct.

102
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,220
A commitment to trying to do something
about the actual problem,

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,950
I think entails a commitment to shedding
the simple just model.

104
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,210
And one more concrete thing I would add
and that is that

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,920
our institutions themselves are,
are sort of sources of,

106
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,050
of situational influence.

107
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,350
And we have for the most part,
been blind to those situational

108
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:21,740
influences and have assume that the way
people have operated as a function of

109
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:25,880
their disposition and not their
institutions in part for that reason,

110
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,881
I think we don't pay close attention to
the way in which there exists a

111
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:36,230
competition over our institutions.
A competition that changes our

112
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:41,090
institutions and in turn changes us.
And this might be everything from our

113
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:44,180
government congress,
our judiciary,

114
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,460
whether whether judges,
state judges,

115
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:51,461
for example or elected may have real
implications for the outcomes of the

116
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,990
decisions and what the nature of those
elections are.

117
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,470
Whether money from large corporations or
other groups can influence those

118
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,180
institutions is something,
again,

119
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:07,181
we've been not inclined to ask very
carefully in part because of our faulty

120
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,750
view of the human animal.
So I would say there are many concrete

121
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,740
ways in which,
um,

122
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,640
I sort of a more situationist,
um,

123
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,670
perspective might change the law.
The details of it though,

124
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,060
I think require first accepting,
uh,

125
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,270
kind of the nature of the problem.
And second,

126
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,940
a,
I'm more general,

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,230
a attempt on the part of many of our
best and brightest legal scholars and

128
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:41,231
young law students and indeed our judges
to help sort out exactly what this

129
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:41,720
means.
