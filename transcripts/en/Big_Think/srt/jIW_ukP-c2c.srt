1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,910
Yeah.
One of the things that,

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,290
the question of what's uniquely humans
is actually a big one.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,970
Um,
and you,

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,490
depending on who you ask,
you might get really different answers.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,760
If I had to put my money on something
that was actually uniquely human,

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,560
it seems in some funny way to be our
motivation to actually interact with

7
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:29,290
others in a funny way.
And what I mean by this is that,

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,040
uh,
you know,

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,960
generally if you look at any humans
anywhere,

10
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:33,400
if they're hanging out with other
humans,

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,160
they're often doing something where
they're showing something to another

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,380
individual.
So you see something cool,

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,730
you say,
Oh hey,

14
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:43,210
look at this cool thing and to
psychologist this is this process of

15
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:43,871
reference,
right?

16
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:46,450
Sort of share referring to information
out there in a world.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,540
And it seems like other primates,
even though you think this is kind of a

18
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,460
simple ability,
they seem to lack at least the

19
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:53,420
motivation to do this.
Um,

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,920
this leads to the fact that they don't
have the kind of communication that we

21
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:00,160
have your things like language with now.
And so it can kind of point to things

22
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,060
out there.
In the world.

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,670
Um,
they also don't seem to share their own

24
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:07,960
desires and intentions with others,
which leads to a lack of kind of

25
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:09,990
cooperation and a lot of domains.
So,

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,460
so if I had to put my money on what was
uniquely human,

27
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,410
I'd,
I'd go with a kind of motivation to

28
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,030
share information with others.
