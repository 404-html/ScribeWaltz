1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,810
We all have intrusive thoughts from time
to time and many of us,

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,210
for example,
will check whether we have our airplane

3
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:16,640
ticket before going to the airport.
More than once.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,870
That isn't ocd tebow CD.
You have to have obsessions and

5
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:25,871
compulsions that impair your life and
are highly distressing and of rule.

6
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,810
A sort of rule book would be maybe at
least an hour a day.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,350
But most of the patients that I work
with will obsess and compulsive for

8
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:36,290
hours a day and really their life can be
ruined.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,170
So I have some patients will come to me
and say,

10
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,030
look,
I know I don't need to be washing my

11
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,800
hands like this,
but I can't stop.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,370
And I have other patients who are really
not sure,

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,490
really not sure.
I mean they really believed that if they

14
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,920
don't wash,
maybe they'll actually get ill.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,040
So there's that sort of range of
insight.

16
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,530
It's also true that someone in my office
can say,

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,140
you know,
I know the subway safe and I could touch

18
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:03,980
that pole.
But if I walk onto the subway with them

19
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:08,210
doing an exposure and ask them to touch
the pole in front of me,

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,240
they lose their ability to ha to,
you know,

21
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:13,100
remember that this isn't going to kill
them.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,680
So obsessive compulsive disorder is a
disorder where patients have obsessions

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,040
and compulsions and obsessions are
intrusive thoughts,

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,170
images or urges that they find very
distressing and are very repetitive and

25
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,800
compulsion's our behavioral acts or
mental acts,

26
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:39,090
things they do in their head over and
over again to try to reduce the

27
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:42,360
distress,
that obsessions cause or to follow

28
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:47,130
specific rules.
So while all patients with ocd have

29
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,920
obsessions and compulsions,
um,

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,580
the content of the obsessions and
compulsions can really vary.

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,770
So one type of patient can have
intrusive concerns about contamination

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,160
and they baby washing,
doing elaborate washing rituals.

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,990
A different patient might have intrusive
thoughts about harming either other

34
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:10,200
people or harm befalling themselves.
And they,

35
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,930
for example,
might have rituals of checking to make

36
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:17,790
sure that the harm didn't happen yet.
Another type of OCD patient might have

37
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:22,791
what's called just so ocd where
everything has to be either arranged,

38
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,120
are ordered in a certain way or they
have to actually do things in a certain

39
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,830
way and they may be repeating and
rearranging and organizing all day long.

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,470
And finally,
there's a group of people who have what

41
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:39,471
we call intrusive taboo thoughts that
can be about sex or religion or,

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,320
or violence.
And often these are images that they

43
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,310
have.
And again,

44
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,940
they might have elaborate rituals to
reassure themselves that they actually

45
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,970
didn't actually commit any of these
acts.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,940
Now,
it's not like ocd patients only have

47
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,170
one.
You know,

48
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:59,860
often ocd patients have more than one of
these types of obsessions and

49
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,650
compulsions together.
But that's sort of a flavor.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,990
So there's a sort of simple version,
right?

51
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,990
Fear of contamination with washing
rituals.

52
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,690
But OCD can get really,
um,

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,580
you know,
sort of far out.

54
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,900
So,
for example,

55
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,580
I once worked with someone who,
um,

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,860
California was contaminated.
And so what it meant was,

57
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,480
um,
um,

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,490
she couldn't have anything in her
apartment that had the name California

59
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,470
in it when mail a envelope had once
arrived to her mailbox that had

60
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,130
California on it,
her mailbox then became contaminated,

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,880
or for example,
um,

62
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,140
intrusive harm befalling.
You know,

63
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,290
I've had patients who,
uh,

64
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,230
worry that maybe they've driven over
someone as they drive and so they can't

65
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,830
make it to work because they're going
around and around the intersection to

66
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,630
make sure that they haven't,
uh,

67
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,630
run someone over.
But the harm can also be very,

68
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,940
very abstract,
not as concrete as that,

69
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,170
but very,
very abstract.

70
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,040
So,
you know,

71
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,970
there are many,
many,

72
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,620
many versions of OCD.

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,470
What we know is that when you do brain
imaging studies of people with OCD and

74
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:15,640
you compare their brain to the brain of
people who don't have a CD,

75
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,940
that there is a hyperactive circuit in
the brain that's been linked to a CD and

76
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,020
that,
uh,

77
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,820
uh,
hyper hyperactivity in that circuit has

78
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,750
been confirmed through animal studies.
And we don't think it's only that

79
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,640
circuit.
We think there are other circuits that

80
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:35,641
are likely involved as well.
But there's a real clear neuroscience of

81
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,590
this.
Um,

82
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,390
behavior of obsessions and compulsions
had the brain get that way.

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,830
And here we know less about that.
What we do know is that in some

84
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,140
families,
but not in all families,

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,970
ocd seems to run in those families.
And certain genetic studies suggest that

86
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,150
there is a familial contribution to a
CD.

87
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,890
But again,
not in all cases,

88
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,310
but exactly how that particular brain
circuit went awry in that particular

89
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,890
patient.
We don't know that we're working on it.

90
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,163
We don't know yet.

91
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,160
Yeah.
