1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,680
I think bloggers or bloggers and there
are good ones in there,

2
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,120
allows you once,
you know,

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,720
Andrew Sullivan is a really good
blocker.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,110
He has four or five issues he's
passionate about.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,730
He has a couple of good webby ideas like
readers sending in pictures out their

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,970
windows.
Um,

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,150
um,
he's good at it.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,780
There are political blogs that are good
at it.

9
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,940
There are specialty blogs that are good
at it.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,630
Um,
are there a lot of bloggers who are

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,240
doing the,
you and I understand to be the

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,790
conventional,
uh,

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,940
reporting,
um,

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,760
work of a Bob Woodward or a Seymour
Hersh or Jane Mayer,

15
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:48,080
whatever.
Not a lot.

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,430
No.
That's expensive.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,020
Consuming a and it's not blogging.
You can't do it five,

18
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,510
six times a day.
On the other hand,

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,620
I'm Joshua and Mika Marshall does a very
good job by continually linking to

20
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:07,481
things that he thinks that you should be
as obsessed with as he is and what

21
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:11,120
you're reading with him as a kind of.
You're staying with a certain political

22
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,380
sensibility.
It's interesting.

23
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,570
So to me the question is not,
are they journalists,

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,550
journalists?
It's just obviously a new form,

25
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:18,920
a different form,
and there are good ones and bad ones.
