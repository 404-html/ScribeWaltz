1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,690
The best ones I go to are divided
between the ones that I will go to once

2
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,780
a month forever.
That I just,

3
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:18,590
I it,
you know,

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,423
I just

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,250
second there are all the time.
Love it.

6
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:23,710
I always go back for something that's a
part.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,210
Then I check out almost every
significant new restaurant.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,450
I live in New York,
so in New York,

9
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:34,480
but wherever I am,
I'm always interested in what's new,

10
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,450
what young chefs are doing,
what's going on.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,870
And I'll go there once or twice
sometimes I get obsessed with a new

12
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:44,560
restaurant and I'll go every other day
for a month.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,780
But um,
that's sort of like the new restaurant

14
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:51,781
piece and then there are major
restaurants that when I'm really almost

15
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:58,681
in a Rut when it comes to creating new
recipes or thinking about food I go to

16
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:04,610
because they're always inspirational.
They're always amazing and they,

17
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:09,550
they always give me something and sort
of restore my faith in cooking and

18
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,710
they're,
they're sort of the temples that are

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,600
necessary.
I'll give you a couple from each

20
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:14,434
category.

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,970
Uh,

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,410
the restaurants that I go to once a
month because they just feel great.

23
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,330
A bow is,
are the oyster bar grand central.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,833
Um,

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,750
uh,

26
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,430
well let's just say those are two good
examples.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,320
And I would put bond street actually in
that category.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,890
Uh,
I would say all three of those are

29
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:47,690
places that are bustling.
The food is really excellent quality.

30
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,680
I mean,
in the case of oyster bar,

31
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,150
I only eat oysters there,
but the food,

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,530
the food is really excellent quality.
Uh,

33
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,030
and it's just a bustling,
great feeling place.

34
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,380
That's that.
That's that kind category.

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,760
The new restaurants,
like what's new and exciting.

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,950
You know,
I went to this place called del Anima

37
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:06,170
the other night,
which was really,

38
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,490
really good.
Really exciting.

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,620
Um,
this,

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,970
uh,

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,940
let me see.
New is always hard because it's a total

42
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:15,810
crapshoot.
You know,

43
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:16,740
you're,
you're,

44
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,741
I want to see what's going on and what's
out there and one out of 10 will be,

45
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,640
um,
will be terrific,

46
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:29,820
you know.
So right now for there's a kind of

47
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,950
Italian resurgence in New York,
actually.

48
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,220
A morality is not that new,
but that's a restaurant that I,

49
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,360
I ate at,
I would say,

50
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,041
you know,
I,

51
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,030
I got,
I got my credit card statement the other

52
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:47,980
day and it was like the only,
the only merchant on it was Miranda I

53
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,120
ate,
they're probably like,

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,790
you know,
20 times a month for three months.

55
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,190
And um,
I was just interested.

56
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,320
I thought the chef was doing certain
things I was really,

57
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,520
really interested in.
And um,

58
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,840
and then the,
the high holy restaurants that I have to

59
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,860
go back to.
Absolutely Babo.

60
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,710
I just think Mario Batali,
he can do no wrong in my book.

61
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,770
He's amazing.
And Babo is,

62
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,600
it's amazing.
Yeah.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,270
You can't get a reservation there.
It's so difficult to get a reservation,

64
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,850
but.
So you would think that it's kind of

65
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:19,361
like,
oh,

66
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,940
so they get into a routine and it
doesn't have to be that great because.

67
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,920
And meanwhile,
every single time you go there,

68
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,690
you have something that you haven't had
before.

69
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,210
That's totally seasonal.
Brilliant.

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,540
It feels like it's existed forever,
except you've never actually had that

71
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,670
dish.
And it's genius.

72
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,970
And George,
I feel the same way it was on.

73
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:41,971
George is interesting to me because the
service there is so pristine that you,

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,650
it's just,
it's just a beauty super hold.

75
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:51,651
It's a beauty to feel
what modern perfect service can be like.

76
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,830
And then of course the food is always
interesting,

77
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,870
always exciting,
always.

78
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,510
Uh,
it always has flavors that are lovely

79
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,880
and wonderful.
And then there are those three

80
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,210
categories you can tell.
I absolutely love eating at restaurants.

81
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,690
Then of course there is ethnic food
which I eat a lot of and I mainly depend

82
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,290
on cab drivers for my recommendations.
And a,

83
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,430
there's just,
you know,

84
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,810
New York is just like a paradise for
that.
