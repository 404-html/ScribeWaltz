1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,170
In Israel,
just to give a general explanation in

2
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:11,921
Israel,
we have,

3
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:14,420
according to the law,
we have to give everything that's

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,040
rewrite about military and intelligence
issues to the military censorship.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,690
This book was submitted to military
censorship when it came back,

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,560
I counted 750 deletions,
a and a tedious negotiation started with

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,830
them
and we submitted some appears to supreme

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,360
court in most cases.
One of them is the case of an in Israeli

9
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:46,360
businessman ex officer with the idea of
a hero of the Yom Kippor,

10
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:50,260
October 72,
the war who became a businessman and

11
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:55,261
cynically crudely and viciously sold
chemical warfare to Iran.

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,860
The fact that this was not caught by
Mozart in time and the whole affair a

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,590
were banned by military censorship.
I appeal to Supreme Court and won.

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,110
And there's a chapter in a book called
the termite file because the whole

15
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,450
operation was called him the termite,
uh,

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,710
describing the operation.

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,040
In some cases we reach compromise.
One of them was very funny.

18
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,300
I think there was.
There's a,

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,290
there's a chapter called the second
coming of Hezbollah that starts with an

20
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,310
interview with a prominent figure
dealing with his Bible in which he says

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,260
in 50 years when they opened the secret
files,

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,700
people in Israel would be amazed to how
poor was the human penetration of

23
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,910
Israeli intelligence into Hezbollah.
When,

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,300
when people would read the secret files
that would be shocked and sad to see

25
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,690
that Masada looked far less,
eh,

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,140
like James Bond and far more like
inspector clouseau.

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,150
And then he asked me,
do you know how many real agent did

28
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,720
Israel have in the ranks of Hisbala?
Like true ranks,

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,950
not in the sympathizers.
Nordion outside circles his troops,

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,520
and he left some fingers of his right
arm.

31
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,550
Now military censorship took everything
out.

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,930
We appealed against it and the outcome
was a compromise in which they permitted

33
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,250
to publish everything.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,050
And it's in the book,
except for the exact number of fingers

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,260
that he lifted.
So if you read it,

36
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,360
you'll see that it's somewhere between
one and five because it's only his right

37
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:41,800
arm and fingers were chopped in previous
operations.

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,960
Uh,
but there's no exact number.

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,130
I think it's ridiculous,
but yet we had to reach some sort of a

40
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,500
compromise.
I would say this,

41
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:55,501
the bottom line is the 95 percent of
this book is new information and I think

42
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:00,710
that after all the knowledge of the
reader of what's going on in that

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,170
clandestine war between Israel and the
United States and one hand in Iran was

44
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,710
not severely damaged by this.
Of.
