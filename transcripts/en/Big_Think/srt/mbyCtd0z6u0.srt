1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,790
It is,
and it isn't in the short term,

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,880
it's not in the short term.
It has stabilized itself politically.

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,720
It's economy is growing.
It controls huge oil and gas resources

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,721
at a point in time where prices are very
high and it is muscling its way around

5
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,380
a,
its neighboring countries.

6
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:25,830
It's so called near abroad by
blackmailing and extorting and those

7
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:29,160
governments such as Ukraine and Georgia
and so forth and even potentially

8
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:31,050
sending troops to intervene and other
areas.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,090
So in a way it seems,
wow,

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,370
Russia is back,
but the longterm picture,

11
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,130
obviously he's different,
uh,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,570
in the long,
long term picture is that they've lost a

13
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,880
large chunk of their territory by the
Judah,

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,000
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Their population is undergoing a

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,400
staggering for you fall.
People talking about Italy,

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,410
you know,
experiencing population decline.

17
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,500
Russia is probably the most steep in the
whole world.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,190
There's,
they lose something like a 500,000 of

19
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:59,910
their population a year due to either
immigration or death,

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,070
uh,
due to various causes.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,490
So in the long term picture from that
point of view isn't very good.

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,500
Uh,
they also have a lot of Chinese

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,990
migration into the country,
into the far east.

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,720
So areas,
parts of the Russian Far East

25
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:17,610
territorially that are Russia on the map
don't look like Russia in person.

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,460
So that's a huge problem to think about
as well.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,670
Then the authoritarian system isn't
necessarily stable.

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,370
Oil prices aren't necessarily going to
be this high forever.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,720
There's a lot of reasons why the current
resurgence is really just a blip and the

30
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,190
longer term picture of Russian decline
very much still holds.

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,310
Well.
Europe already does encroach on Russia's

32
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,940
territory in the sense that between NATO
expansion and EU expansion,

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,420
they more or less are up against the
borders of Russia,

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,020
the Baltic countries they are,
and the relationship with Ukraine,

35
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:55,540
which is deepening,
is also getting it in that direction as

36
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,070
well as at the countries of the
caucuses,

37
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:01,750
Georgia and Armenia and Azerbaijan.
So gradually Europe is certainly

38
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:05,290
encroaching on Russia as much as Europe
would serve as much as Russia would like

39
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,900
to be encroached on.
And D in Finland,

40
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,900
there was a debate about what
relationship to have with NATO and the

41
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,420
EU and whether to actually deepen those
ties,

42
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,020
yet more evidence of how like it or not,
uh,

43
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:21,190
Russia basically is left with only
Russia and a diminishing influence

44
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:24,280
outside its own borders.
Nuclear weapons are still there.

45
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,680
It has the second largest nuclear
arsenal in the world,

46
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,710
but it is,
um,

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,720
not the weapon of choice in the 21st
century.

48
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,230
And of course,
Russia only has two major population

49
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,460
centers or economic hubs.
So it obviously faces serious

50
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,100
retaliation.
So the last country in the world that

51
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,650
would be wise to use nuclear weapons
would be roger.
