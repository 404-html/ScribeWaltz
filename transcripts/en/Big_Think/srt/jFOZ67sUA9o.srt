1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,300
The medical model that might begin to
talk about this problem based model is,

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,880
is really restricted.
It,

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,220
it's very powerful and it helps us,
but,

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,590
but it only takes us so far.
The fundamental nature of dying is not

5
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,600
medical,
it's personal.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,340
And so,
you know,

7
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:32,341
dying cannot be encompassed by a set of
medical problems and a set of diagnoses

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,350
and treatments.
Um,

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,020
so while we,
while we can,

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,450
can remain disease focused,
um,

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,250
for as long as it makes sense,
we also have to attend to the personal

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,610
aspects of dying of people.
You know,

13
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,090
the,
the,

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,090
what you lose and dying in the hospital
many times is you lose that personal

15
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:55,750
time.
Your,

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,390
your,
your space is not your own people walk

17
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,450
in and out.
Um,

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,740
you don't have the sort of privacy or
intimacy with family.

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,660
Beyond that though we stayed within that
medical model.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,770
Everybody who walks in your room or
interacts with you are talking to you

21
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:15,850
about medical problems.
They will continue to conscript your

22
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:19,780
attention to the lab tests and the next,
uh,

23
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,970
scans and the next treatments and the
drugs and your vital signs and all of

24
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:27,340
that.
Um,

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,150
instead of attending to the personal,
they actually conscript your time and

26
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:36,151
energy for the medical,
the best end of life care that I know of

27
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:40,540
through modeled by hospice programs and,
and the best palliative care programs

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,110
still does all the medical stuff,
but it's subordinated to the personal.

29
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,523
It's,
it's,

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,150
you know,
in hospice care,

31
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,320
we make appointments to see you and your
family and not the other way around.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,930
We're coming to your home.
We are,

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,993
um,
uh,

34
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,340
explicitly acknowledging the importance
of Interactions,

35
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,790
um,
of your privacy and intimacy.

36
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,440
And beyond that we're even offering some
help,

37
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:16,441
some guidance that may be a value to you
in this area of,

38
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,570
of human interaction.

39
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,690
I would call life completion in life
closure,

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,670
you know,
which again,

41
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,360
in a problem based medical model doesn't
even exist.

42
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,450
It's not their quality of life and
quality of life completion really exists

43
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:38,020
in a,
in a developmental model that really

44
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,780
honors the,
the breadth of human life for the person

45
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:41,950
and family,
but,

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,010
but not in a problem based model.
So even the very best of of a problem

47
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:52,981
based medicine and including attention
to symptoms in the like tends not to see

48
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:58,000
those personal experiences of completing
one's affairs,

49
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,420
fiscal and legal and project related
affairs,

50
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,790
but also their personal affairs,
their,

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,240
their relationships and their
explorations of the own meaning and

52
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,690
significance of their own life,
their relationship to something larger

53
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:17,980
than themselves.
That stuff that's not abstract for

54
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,670
people who know that,
that their life is measured in weeks or

55
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,110
days.
It's,

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,350
it's very tangible.
