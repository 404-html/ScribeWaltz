1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,740
Let's talk about a particularly
provocative set of experience that

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,830
meredith chippers has done is this
fascinating Canadian researcher I've

3
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:20,171
spent so much time with,
so several years ago when I first got

4
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,870
interested in her work and I kind of
stumbled into her lab.

5
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:28,871
I was working on a different unrelated
project at the time when I stumbled into

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:33,770
her lab.
I've found her showing an array of

7
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:36,620
pornography,
so men with women,

8
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,510
women with women,
men alone,

9
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,511
women alone,
and even bonobos having sex to self

10
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,190
identified straight women,
gay women,

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,510
straight men,
gay men,

12
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,810
and measuring both their physical
response that is vaginal or response in

13
00:00:55,791 --> 00:01:00,791
terms of erection for men and then
they're subjective response via keypad.

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,430
How turned on do I say I am?
And finding something fascinating which

15
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,960
was that wears male response was pretty
predictable.

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,620
The straight men actually did mostly
just get turned on to men with women or

17
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,880
women with women.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,190
Gay Men equally predictable.
The women were very unpredictable and

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,140
kind of anarchic in at least their
physical response.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,320
So again,
there was this big dichotomy.

21
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:36,770
The women were saying,
I'm turned on by what I quote should be

22
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:41,771
turned on by straight women,
by men with women or to a certain

23
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,430
degree,
I suppose men with men and gay women by

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
images of women,
et Cetera,

25
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,260
but their bodies were saying something
completely different and their bodies

26
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:56,261
were saying they were turned on by all
of it and perhaps most strikingly you

27
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:02,540
might think those bonobos having sex,
but at least you know,

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,720
reach something animalistic in men.
Know the men showed zero response

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,830
subjectively or physically,
but the women did show this physical

30
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:16,190
response to the image of Bonobos having
sex.

31
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:18,560
So a lot of interesting things about
this,

32
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:23,561
probably too many to name,
but one for sure is that the idea of

33
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:28,721
women's sexuality as somehow more
controlled needs to be put aside.

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,240
If we're going to do any serious
searching about arrows and women and to

35
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,100
this idea that women are somehow less
than visual,

36
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,770
less immediate in their sexuality than
men.

37
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,390
Again,
need to put that aside.

38
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:45,980
If we're going to do any serious looking
at truths about women's sexuality,

39
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,850
now here's a bit of later shivers
research that both goes along with but

40
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:58,811
also pulls us in a slightly different
direction than that original set of

41
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:01,720
studies.
So remember,

42
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,260
part of the original set of studies
shows women being quite a narcotic and

43
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,170
what they're drawn to.
She Evers decides,

44
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,990
okay,
let me take a set of straight women self

45
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,850
declared straight women and show them
just for types of photographs and see

46
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,490
what happens for types of pornographic
photographs.

47
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,820
So we've got a full lasted and these are
kind of December bodied,

48
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,760
a genital shots just so we have nothing
to distract us.

49
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,440
Not a pretty phased out,
a handsome face,

50
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:36,460
et cetera.
So we've got a dangling flacid penis.

51
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,730
We've got an erect penis,
we've got to kind of coy,

52
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,580
soft porn,
female crotch shot legs together.

53
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,340
And then we've got a uh,
legs spread,

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,320
more hardcore shot.
So the straight women do respond to all

55
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:55,321
of it physically.
But that erect penis sends the

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,380
plethysmograph the measure of physical
response.

57
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,780
Sorry.
And it's just an indication,

58
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,810
again,
of

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,640
rawness immediacy.
And just,

60
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,350
uh,
kind of this is about sex.

61
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,370
Let's be careful before we complicate it
with all the factors that we habitually

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,570
complicate female sexuality with.
There is a core to this and we shouldn't

63
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,810
be so quick to look away from it.

64
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,590
Mm.
