1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,250
Like heroes were actually the great 
dinosaur hunters of the American museum.

2
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:13,084
Roy Chapman,
Andrews granger on those guys say going 

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,293
a certainly a hero.
I have a lot of heroes within my own 

4
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:23,370
disciplines that are probably too 
arcane.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,800
But Steven j gold was perhaps my 
greatest hero.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,140
I knew it very well.
Uh,

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,440
I knew him well enough that I got in 
trouble a lot with him.

8
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,750
He started viewed me as this 
cantankerous,

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:37,630
younger brother.
He once told a Peter,

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,333
you'll never be great,
but you're pretty good now that that's 

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,940
quite a slap in the face,
right?

12
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:45,820
We all want to be great.
But it was from Steve Say,

13
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,070
Yo,
I'm great and you're not as great as me.

14
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:48,904
But,
but I liked the fact that you're doing 

15
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,570
good work.
And it was that sort of relationship.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,250
Okay.
But I miss him.

17
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,084
I miss his voice.
He was the greatest single public 

18
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,170
speaker I've ever,
ever heard.

19
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:01,080
He was also the smartest man I've ever 
known.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,880
I've known quite a few intelligent 
people,

21
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:07,750
but he was his,
his processing speed was beyond belief.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,250
That's a great,
it's a great voice.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,113
Lost

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,530
[inaudible].
