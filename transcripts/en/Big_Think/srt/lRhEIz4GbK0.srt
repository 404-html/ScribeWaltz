1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,560
When I feel depressed,
like

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,460
I say,
I feel down,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,430
right?
As I was learning about the causes of

4
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,101
depression,
anxiety,

5
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,100
if I bit lost connections,
I started to realize,

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,730
I don't think that's the metaphor.
This is amazing.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,550
Um,
professor at Stanford called Robert

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,800
Sapolsky,
who in his early twenties went to live

9
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:29,801
with a troop of baboons in Kenya,
and it was his job to figure out when

10
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:34,970
are baboons most stressed out.
So his job was to hit them with little

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:37,400
tranquilizer darts and then take a blood
test and measure something called

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,730
Cortisol,
which is a hormone that Bobbins and ours

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,410
released when we're stressed.
And baboons live in this hierarchy,

14
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,990
so the females don't interestingly,
but the men live in a very strict

15
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:49,460
hierarchy.
So if there's 30 men,

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,520
number one notice above number two,
and I've been tuned noses above number

17
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,800
three,
number 12 notices by number 13.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,350
And that really determines a lot of the
Tennessee you get to have sex with.

19
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:00,470
It determines what you get to eat.
It determines whether you get to sit in

20
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:02,810
the shade or pushed out into the heat.
Yeah,

21
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:05,000
it's a really,
really significant way you are in the,

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,360
in the hierarchy and what professors are
polsky found is I've been to,

23
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:15,721
are most stressed in two situations.
One is when their status is insecure.

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,370
So if you're the top guy and someone's
circling,

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,830
which comes for Ya,
uh,

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,990
you will be massively stressed.
And the other situation is when you feel

27
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,300
you're at the bottom of a hierarchy,
your,

28
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:27,230
your,
your,

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,390
you know,
you've been kind of humiliated.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,570
And what,
what professor Sir Pasky found,

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,990
which I think is really noticed and then
it was later developed by other

32
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:39,320
scientists is when you feel you've been
pushed to the bottom,

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,950
what you do is you show something called
it submission gesture.

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,340
So you baboons will raise a,
as I say,

35
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,810
you,
I seem assume by means of watching this,

36
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:52,811
maybe they are you a Babin will put its
body down physically or put its head

37
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,370
down.
It will put its bottom in the air and it

38
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,740
will cover its head.
So it's clearly seems to be

39
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,690
communicating,
just leave me alone.

40
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:00,680
You've beaten me.
Okay,

41
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,030
you've beaten me.
And what lots of scientists or

42
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,200
subsequent about people like professor
Paul Gilbert in Britain and Professor

43
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,810
Kate Pickett and professor Richard
Wilkinson also in Britain,

44
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,530
have really developed as this idea that
actually what human depression is in

45
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:13,610
part,
not entirely,

46
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,940
but in part is a form of a submission
gesture.

47
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,820
It's a way of saying,
I can't cope with this anymore.

48
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,410
Right.
Particularly people who feel they've

49
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:24,080
been pushed to the bottom of hierarchies
or he feel,

50
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,900
remember the other stressful situations
when you feel your status is insecure,

51
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,180
it's a way of just going,
okay,

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,020
I retreat.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,540
I don't want this fight anymore.
You'd beaten me.

54
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,370
It's,
it's a kind of very strong evolutionary

55
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:37,910
impulse where you feel you're under
attack to just submit in the hope that

56
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:42,140
the stress and anxiety will then go away
and that the sources of the stress and

57
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,940
anxiety will then go away.
And one thing,

58
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,420
so pondering cable,
consider,

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,970
sorry.
Kate Pickett in Richard Wilkinson really

60
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:50,750
developed this is,
they've shown so and I was,

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,180
an inequality grows,
um,

62
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,300
depression and anxiety grow.
They've shown this very robust effect,

63
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,250
right?
This helps us to explain it.

64
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,990
If you live Norway,
you're status is relatively secure,

65
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,120
right?
No one's that high.

66
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,220
No one's that low.
Um,

67
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,520
movement between where you are is not so
extreme.

68
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,040
If you live in the United States,
especially today,

69
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,430
which is we're now at the greatest
levels of inequality since the 1920s

70
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,000
there's a few people at the very top.

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,510
There's a kind of precarious middle,
and there's a huge and swelling bottom,

72
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,560
right?
So you've got,

73
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,290
you can see why in the United States
you've got more people who'd be showing

74
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,120
a submission gesture,
who'd be like,

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,751
oh,
Jesus,

76
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,910
I'm,
I've been beaten than they would be in

77
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,670
Norway.
This is why inequality is one of the

78
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,671
drivers of depression and anxiety and
why dealing with inequality reduces

79
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,140
inequality and anxiety.
It's one of the things that really

80
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,130
shocked me actually,
it was looking at,

81
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,670
in the United States,
the group with the lowest depression by

82
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,800
far as the amish.
So I went and spent time with an amish

83
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,560
community.
The Amish live in these homogenous

84
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,600
groups,
which are incredibly equal.

85
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,870
The richest amish is as worth as much as
the poorest amish,

86
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,330
right?
They're not showing sub submission

87
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:00,730
gestures in the same way cause nope,
they don't fit.

88
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,410
There's a lot wrong with the amish.
Don't get me wrong,

89
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm not suggesting mass conversion to
the Amish.

90
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm a gay man.
Believe me,

91
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,580
I'm not.
But,

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,530
but we,
we can learn from the fact that in these

93
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:12,310
highly equal and homogenous groups,
you don't have that,

94
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,440
that extreme status stress.
Now,

95
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,660
I don't want to go as far as the amish
deep,

96
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:18,880
but we moving closer to it would be one
of the factors that would reduce

97
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:19,930
depression and anxiety.

98
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.
