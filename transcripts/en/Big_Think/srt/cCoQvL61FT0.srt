1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,990
Cybersecurity is a unique challenge
today because when we are so utterly

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:07,710
dependent upon our digital
communications and our digital control

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,300
of things,
and so it's going to become evermore

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,740
essential that we have the ability to
provide security that we're confident

5
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:17,280
in.
The challenge is if we were against

6
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:21,060
doctor know or Mr big in a cave
somewhere,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,810
you could understand the threat and you
could sort of limit the threat and the

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,080
threat would have a.
A predictable limitation and what they

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,030
could do.
They'd have to pick an avenue of

10
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,120
approach and they'd have to go at that
avenue of approach because they can't do

11
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:36,210
all things at all times.
The problem with Cybersecurity,

12
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,450
that's not the threat.
There are some entities like that.

13
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,750
There's some state sponsored entities
that are focused on certain things,

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,670
but the barrier to entry into the cyber
world is very low.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,940
You can get in your basement,
in your boxer shorts and you can have a

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,860
computer and you can get into the game
and it's sort of the idea of 10,000

17
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,030
monkeys typing on 10,000 keyboards.
Somebody's going to create a

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,060
cybersecurity challenge and so and it's
constantly morphing and adapting,

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,050
whereas the cybersecurity requirement is
to protect things so you essentially

20
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:13,470
have to protect everything that you
value all the time.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,430
The people who want to attack that can
attack at their choosing wherever they

22
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:21,060
want and constantly changed their
attacks constantly.

23
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:25,890
Just like water goes against a damn.
It just goes until it finds the weakest

24
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,960
point.
At some point something happens,

25
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,940
technology changes,
human error,

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,050
technological glitch or whatever.
There's a good likelihood that they'll

27
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:37,620
get in.
And so if you think about the

28
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,320
cybersecurity problem,
the first thing I don't think will work

29
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,220
is the Maginot line.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,470
You know,
the Maginot line was created by the

31
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,330
French in the 19 thirties to prevent the
Germans from doing a repeat of the first

32
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,340
world war and invading France from
Germany.

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,940
People think of it now is the stupidest
thing ever built,

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,960
but it's not really correct because the
Maginot line actually worked.

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,620
The Germans did not invade across the
German French border.

36
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,870
Now,
the fact is they went through Belgium.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,680
They still got into France and conquered
France and the summer 1940,

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,140
so I think the lesson to be learned is
there have to be defensive things set up

39
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:17,460
as best we can for cybersecurity,
but it's going to have to be this

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,490
constantly adapting,
constantly morphing defense-in-depth

41
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,120
with some offense to with going out and
figuring out where the threats are

42
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,770
arising and that that defense in depth
means that you can't have one line.

43
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,070
The government can't put a big wall up
and everybody hides behind it.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,330
Nor do we want each organization,
each commercial firm or government

45
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,330
organization to be an island under
themselves,

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,560
just hoping that they are not the
weakest willdabeast in the herd and that

47
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:51,000
the lines of get somebody else.
What we really need is all of those

48
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:54,120
entities to be linked so they constantly
learn from one another.

49
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,960
If one suffers a breach,
everyone has to learn from it.

50
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,250
Right now,
the challenge is people are low.

51
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:02,860
The share that information,
one,

52
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,500
because commercially they might be hurt
by reputation.

53
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,470
Also,
they're afraid that the more you share,

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,450
the more you have the event,
the,

55
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,570
uh,
possibility of your little island is not

56
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:18,571
completely separated your moat around it
has got linkages across it and you can

57
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,210
be opened up more,
but we're going to have to get a network

58
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:26,440
to defense where every time something
happens and we learned from it,

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,650
the entire network learns immediately.

60
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,700
We're going to have to have that kind of
speed because there will be breaches,

61
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,760
there will be mistakes,
but the organism,

62
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,880
organisms,
gotta learn.

63
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,130
It's going to have to be a lot like the
human immune system.

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,610
The human immune system is extraordinary
because about 10,000 times a day it gets

65
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,380
attacked by something that could hurt
the human body,

66
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:52,381
but as it responds and it sends out an
antibodies to it,

67
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,530
it does it and it learns from that.
And so that has a breach one time.

68
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,570
It actually builds up antibodies against
that challenge and has them at the ready

69
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,210
for the next time.
That's how we build up immunity to

70
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,640
things,
and I think the human immune system is

71
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,830
the way our cyber defense is going to
have to be,

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,860
which means that it has to be
integrated.
