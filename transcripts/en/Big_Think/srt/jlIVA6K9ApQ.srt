1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,830
Tight Times is when you're tested hot,
it's an,

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,910
it's a moment when you can redefine and
slash or sustain the definition of the

3
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:21,250
firm that you've had up to now.
So if you already a high commitment,

4
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:25,270
high performance from a,
you want to make decisions that are

5
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,270
consistent with the path you've been on
a,

6
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:29,640
so you,
uh,

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,750
and,
and if you are not a high commitment,

8
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,720
high performance from,
you want to see this as an opportunity

9
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:38,560
to redefine the nature of the firm,
the relationship between yourself and

10
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,210
the employees,
the nature of the,

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
of the culture and so forth.
So how do you do that?

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,410
Uh,
uh,

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,270
you,
you,

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,850
you do not do that by maintaining
distance between yourself and those who,

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,551
who,
you know,

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,610
you're going to have to hurt all.
So there's gotta be,

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,060
there's gotta be some hurt here,
uh,

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,380
but some of the policies are,
first of all,

19
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,930
to try to create a,
a,

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,670
a,
an equality of sacrifice.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,460
So one of the,
uh,

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,360
one of the approaches,
high commitment,

23
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:12,361
high performance organizations use is to
have a pay freeze or a across the board

24
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:16,810
pay cut as opposed to slicing and dicing
and maintaining,

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,720
you know,
only only certain people and laying off

26
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:23,110
people you want to maintain as many of
the people as you can that you may still

27
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:26,860
have to let people go,
but that's a last stage and if you do

28
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:29,440
need to let them go,
you let them go based on,

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,550
uh,
based on the fact that somehow their

30
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,510
position is going to be eliminated.
They,

31
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,200
what they're doing is going to be no
longer central strategically in the

32
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,460
organization.
Uh,

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,360
and it's based on some measure of
performance contribution.

34
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,650
But you try to maintain as many of the
employees as you can.

35
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,380
So you take nucor steel,
another high commitment high performance

36
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,750
company which has,
which was born right,

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,400
they didn't need to transform.

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,920
What they've done is cut across the
board.

39
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,450
I mean the steel industry has been
horrible.

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,750
So they have been cutting pay by as much
as 50 percent across the board and

41
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:11,880
making sure that senior leaders is
equality of sacrifice senior leaders to

42
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,610
taking that 50 percent cut and more,
uh,

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,450
that employees understand that,
uh,

44
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,960
secondly,
that you're trying to get more

45
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:27,280
engagement with people around solving
the firm's problems in tight times.

46
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,140
So some of the ideas we talked about
earlier,

47
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:32,530
bringing people together,
giving them a voice about what it is

48
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,030
that the firm can do better both to
improve productivity and performance and

49
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,310
also make their life better.
So again,

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,210
duality of goals.
How do we do things right for people and

51
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,620
how do we do things right for
performance,

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,460
but engaging people in honest
conversation.

53
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,660
So here's what we're trying to do.
First of all,

54
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,310
tell us what we're trying to make sense.

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,170
Have you,
do you have any suggestions?

56
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,980
Uh,
and then engaging them in what the firm

57
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:01,150
can do differently and better.
And the argument I would make is that

58
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,680
when,
if you haven't already done that,

59
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,080
what you will learn is an awful lot of
stuff you should have learned five,

60
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:09,310
10 years ago about how the firm can be
improved and how productivity can be

61
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,670
improved.
But now you're engaging people in a time

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,440
of need for them and the firm.
And that will make it easier for you

63
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,410
actually to engage people as opposed to
harder.

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,330
But all of this requires that the
leaders engage directly with the people.

65
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,190
It can't be done through announcements,
it can't be done through sending your hr

66
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:32,290
people out to do it.
Uh,

67
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,680
they can be assisting you,
but,

68
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,310
but you have to go out and talk to
people directly.

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,800
Uh,
and so for example,

70
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,320
diaries,
ice cream on the west coast when they

71
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,980
had some tough times,
uh,

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,070
quite a few years ago,
uh,

73
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,430
the CEO and some of the leadership team
went around to every part of the

74
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,790
organization.
Talk to every employee practically about

75
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,000
what the situation of the company was,
what,

76
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,160
what was wrong,
what will,

77
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:01,270
what the problem was,
why they were had to make some changes.

78
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,210
And then engage people in discussions
about that.
