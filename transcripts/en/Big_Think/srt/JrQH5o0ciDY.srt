1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,290
We ran into a tragedy,
however,

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,460
when I was four,
my one year old sister died suddenly

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,120
from croup form of pneumonia,
I guess,

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,560
and she was my mother's
attempt to be born again,

5
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,660
you might say through her daughter
because he's great.

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,350
Wives,
lived very tough lives giving how their

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,590
husbands were working and when she lost
her beloved daughter,

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,080
she went into very deep mourning.
And I,

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,710
uh,
as a child who normally

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,880
thinks we,
I think we think of ourselves as the

11
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:59,690
center of the solar system.
Everything revolves around us.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,110
We're responsible for everything.
I guess I wondered why as my mother

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,080
withdrew and to the deepest,
deepest depression psychologically what

14
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:17,621
I did to cause her to abandon me,
added to my complexities,

15
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:23,120
I guess you'd say I formed a,
a,

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,680
a pattern of having to achieve and
having to be perfect so I could somehow

17
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:32,450
regained her,
uh,

18
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,050
her affection and her attention and
that's had some good points and had some

19
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:44,681
bad points because trying to achieve
perfection can be a productive.

20
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:49,550
It can also be a very destructive
process after awhile.

21
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,760
So she had quite an impact on me.
