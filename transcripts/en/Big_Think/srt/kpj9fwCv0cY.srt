1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,770
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,400
I think they're all a number of
different examples in,

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,810
uh,
in different places.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,590
I think it's hard to make sort of this
and I want to make any sort of sort of a

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,660
grand statement to say,
oh,

6
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:23,090
this executive gets it across the board.
I think there are,

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,020
you know,
you can,

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,850
you can point to what the New York Times
is done with,

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,950
uh,
with our apis instead of making that

10
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:32,630
information widely available at the
Guardian has done some similar things in

11
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,430
the UK.
Sticking in the UK.

12
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:35,930
You can,
you can look at the Telegraph which has

13
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,090
done.
They've really begun to sort of figure

14
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,330
out what,
what are the core functions that we need

15
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,780
to do and we need to own in house and
what are the ones that we can outsource.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,850
Um,
whether it's sort of technology,

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,120
um,
or even forms of sort of the content

18
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:49,550
instead of,
and,

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:49,921
and,
and the,

20
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:51,140
and the printing of the papers.

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,350
Um,
uh,

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,040
you can look at the Journal and what
they've had.

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,750
Some of the experiments that they've
done around around paid content and

24
00:00:56,751 --> 00:01:00,860
trying to sort of find out how these,
both paid content and free content can

25
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,010
coexist on the web,
how to sort of have their cake and eat

26
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:04,550
it too,
with,

27
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,000
with,
with,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,620
with traffic coming in,
but also having a,

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,650
having a subscriber base.
Um,

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,140
I mean,
I think there's a,

31
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,260
you know,
the fte sticking with the paid content

32
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:15,170
side of things where they sort of did
this metered model for content.

33
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,760
I think there's,
there's been a number of different

34
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:20,180
innovations and I think it ranges across
the board.

35
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,590
Um,
La Times.

36
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,740
Another great example of using
technology that's not their own to tell

37
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,240
stories better online,
uh,

38
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,820
in this case you,
the way that they use google maps.

39
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,260
I mean,
I,

40
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,410
I kind of always point them out as,
as,

41
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,770
as,
as a perfect use case of this where,

42
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,470
um,
la times coverage of the wildfires,

43
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,290
which unfortunately is basically every
year you've got these series of

44
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,124
wildfires.

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,540
Uh,
and they just,

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,580
they,
they take Google maps to take our API.

47
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,620
They plug it in,
they put their images on there,

48
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:46,790
they put the stories,
they,

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,550
they,
they annotate the map to show where the

50
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:52,340
damages were,
the evacuation areas are the latest

51
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:55,060
developments of it cause it's a very
visual story beyond just the,

52
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,910
the images of the fire itself,
but to see the location of it as well.

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,240
I'm just a really good example of how
they can use technology that's not their

54
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:05,630
own to tell stories in a different way.
That's just simply not even possible

55
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,850
offline.
If you take a look at the paper and you

56
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:08,810
can say,
well here's,

57
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,240
here's the fire,
but it's real time.

58
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,400
It's dynamic.
So I think there are,

59
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,770
there are a number of different people
who are doing interesting things and

60
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:19,520
those are just the big players that,
that doesn't even touch on all the sort

61
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,520
of small startups that are just doing a
really,

62
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,640
really interesting things.
Some which are just weird and strange

63
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:27,810
and ultimately maybe you'd say are bad,
um,

64
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,970
but are just,
are really encouraging attempts to sort

65
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:34,070
of try and figure out how to use the
medium differently.

66
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,171
I think.
Absolutely.

67
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,040
I mean,
I think that they have,

68
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,420
they are very aware of the traffic that
they get that is now beyond their

69
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,440
borders.
And that gets back into there.

70
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,950
There's the downside to the local
monopoly,

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,050
uh,
the local newspaper that had a monopoly

72
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,600
on information that all of a sudden it
sort of broken down.

73
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,730
But that's,
that's the downside from a business

74
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,800
model standpoint.
But the upside for the business model is

75
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,750
this,
that I,

76
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,630
I don't,
it doesn't cost a,

77
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,870
you know,
even a fraction of a penny to reach a

78
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,380
user who's,
you know,

79
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,240
tens of thousands of miles away from me
if I've got this great content.

80
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,100
So you see things like the Guardian,
the Telegraph,

81
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,720
the BBC,
which is,

82
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,530
you know,
really I would argue is,

83
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,540
um,
is,

84
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,860
is not just a,
a,

85
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,590
a,
a UK source of news is really sort of a

86
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,120
global source of news done in some ways.

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
It always has been.
But,

88
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,000
um,
the way that they can reach people on

89
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,700
online is I think is,
is very different.

90
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,330
And they begin to think about how can I
cover stories differently?

91
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,800
Who's,
who's my audience?

92
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,920
I think that the definition of audience
is is rapidly changing.

93
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,310
The Guardian experimented a little bit
with having a,

94
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,210
a,
a,

95
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,520
a bureau in the US and trying to set a
target information specifically for

96
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,170
those of us users,
but it's,

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,660
it's really trying to get those
different perspectives and being able to

98
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:45,640
read them.
Just clicking.

99
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,540
I mean like you don't have to go down to
the sort of know that the,

100
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,710
you know,
that one new stand that has all the

101
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,560
different international magazines and
newspapers.

102
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,110
I'm sort of maybe sort of frequented by
ex pats.

103
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,700
All that information is online and I
think that's really changed their ideas

104
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,500
of what their audiences and how to reach
people.
