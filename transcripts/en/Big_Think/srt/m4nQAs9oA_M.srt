00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,450
I remember the first search engines came
around and back then Alta Vista was a

2
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,720
very big thing.
I'll try to strike a balance between the

3
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,300
inconveniences in terms of advertising
and so on.

4
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:21,680
They could put on the user and the
utility had for the users,

5
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:22,411
so it would,
for instance,

6
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:27,150
mixed search results with advertising
and at this point Google came along.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,450
Google was very small and
inconsequential and nobody really took

8
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,820
it seriously,
but it did an amazing thing.

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,980
It did give people exactly what they
wanted.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,530
It give them a pretty much ad free
experience.

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,750
I gave them exactly the search result
that they wanted,

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,380
the best one's closest ones to what
people wanted to have.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,020
Google dramatically outperformed Alta
Vista,

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,460
Altavista disappeared,
and that was an amazing insight to see

15
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:54,540
that if you are in a dramatically
scalable economy like the Internet for

16
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,600
you have the biggest amount of
competition that you can possibly have.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,700
You need to build a product that is
optimally aligned with the interests of

18
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:06,880
the users unless you manage to get some
kind of monopoly and can drive out all

19
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:11,670
the competition.
And so when we build new products in

20
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,130
that space,
we have to think about how to build the

21
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,160
most useful product,
not necessarily just the product that is

22
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,510
going to make the biggest amount of
money that is going to have the most

23
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:24,480
efficient business model in some sense,
or the best business case.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,950
Eventually it's going to be the product
that is getting the most used by people

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,530
and people will find out that they will
use most what is most useful to them in

26
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,330
the long run.
That's going to be the staff that is not

27
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,970
addictive,
hygienic,

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,340
that serves the actual needs that makes
them more happy and fulfilled.

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,990
And right now we mostly build
applications that utilize the cravings

30
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:49,920
of people that make them addicted.
People start checking their smartphones

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,380
every few seconds to see if a new email
arrived,

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,970
but this new email is not going to make
them more happy and fulfilled is instead

33
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,950
it takes survey their attention.
So I believe the next big movement in

34
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:06,510
how we built technical systems will be
hygienic technology.

35
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,610
It will be how to build systems that is
careful with our attention,

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,320
how we use it,
and that is careful of is our way of

37
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,410
living and what we want to achieve is
the tools that we are building.
