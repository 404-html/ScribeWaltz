1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,530
So for a long time,
oil is played a special role in American

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:15,531
foreign policy and military strategy.
Oil is a uniquely important commodity in

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,200
global affairs.
It's an input to everything in our

4
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,600
modern way of life.
It's very important for protecting our

5
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,601
prosperity and at a certain level,
oil is essential for a high quality

6
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,930
military power to fight.
You need access to oil.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,520
And in the Cold War,
the United States was concerned that the

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,270
Soviet Union could interrupt American
access to Persian Gulf oil,

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,570
which we needed in order to defend
Europe,

10
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:44,760
defend our own interests against the
Soviet Union.

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,910
And so we took it on as a military
mission to protect key sources of oil

12
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:53,340
supplies around the world,
especially in the Persian Gulf from

13
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:56,400
outside interference.
So from the Soviet Union,

14
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,930
being able to threaten them now,
of course,

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,040
for a long time.
So the union hasn't existed.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,170
That particular scenario hasn't posed a
challenge for the United States,

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,410
but the United States has feared oil is
continuing to play a role in American

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,430
foreign and military policy because the
United States has feared that political

19
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,980
disruptions in the Middle East internal
instability.

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,070
Um,
uh,

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
the threat of a extremists
fundamentalist Muslim control in the

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,190
Middle East,
if that came about,

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,330
could pose a threat to American oil
supplies that especially with hurt our

24
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,320
prosperity,
right,

25
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,090
that they could,
they could make us poor.

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,210
And so we've used a military force to,
to try to,

27
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,000
um,
reduce instability in parts of the

28
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,520
world,
especially the Persian Gulf where,

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,160
uh,
we're afraid that instability would

30
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:52,161
threaten global oil markets.
That policy has both being largely

31
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:56,850
unnecessary and largely ineffective.
So,

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,420
uh,
it has happened that there was a moment

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
where it seemed to work very well when
we sent troops in 1992 defend Saudi

34
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,190
Arabia from Saddam Hussein who had just
conquered Kuwait and then we liberated

35
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:14,370
Kuwait in the Gulf War but did not
continue to attack Iraq.

36
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,830
And,
uh,

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,220
the result of this was to maintain
access to Persian Gulf oil to maintain

38
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,950
the independence of a number of Persian
Gulf oil producers.

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,750
And that made sense in a bunch of ways.
Um,

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,310
but then,
uh,

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,040
since that time,
we've actually become a primary threat

42
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,870
to stability in the Middle East rather
than a primary guarantor of stability.

43
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,330
In the Middle East and that when we
invaded Iraq,

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,670
we set in motion a lot of,
uh,

45
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,960
events created a much more,
um,

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,970
uh,
salient,

47
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,730
a internal stability challenge for many
countries in the,

48
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,910
in the Persian Gulf,
by,

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,060
by hardening and militarizing,
a domestic conflict and a of these

50
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:04,381
countries between Sunnis and Shiites,
between different brands of within Sunni

51
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,830
Islam or within shaded,
we've created internal instability,

52
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,240
um,
that,

53
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,600
uh,
we can't address very well from outside,

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,940
right?
The United States lacks the detailed

55
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,330
information to understand and manipulate
the politics of these countries.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,300
Instead,
we get manipulated by local actors than

57
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,620
in a sense makes the instability worse.
So if you think of it this way in the

58
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,240
United States,
we spend a lot of time thinking about

59
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,550
and studying American politics and
elections,

60
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,980
but we don't understand American
politics very well,

61
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,850
even with all of the background cultural
knowledge we have and understanding of

62
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,750
our own politics.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,880
Nobody expected president trump to rise
as a phenomenon and become president.

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,000
Um,
uh,

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,170
we don't understand our own politics.
How can we expect to understand and

66
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:52,171
manipulate the politics of faraway
countries in the Persian Gulf where,

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,350
um,
we don't know the local person inches?

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,310
Well,
we don't know the situation on the

69
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,560
ground.
We don't know what contributes to

70
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,310
people's political activism,
although we can actually be fairly sure

71
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,220
of one thing that contributes,
which is they don't like the feeling

72
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,910
that they're being pushed around by
outside influences like the United

73
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,770
States showing up and telling them what
to do.

74
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,570
And so we can create hostility to the
United States by saying,

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,730
oh,
we're showing up to defend the stability

76
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:23,410
of Middle East oil supplies,
but we can't actually defend Middle East

77
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,530
oil supplies from local instability in
the Middle East.

78
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,260
Very well.
And so we've actually created a lot of

79
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,910
the problems in the oil market.

80
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,000
However,
all of that said,

81
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,400
the global oil market protects us,
so we don't actually have to worry as

82
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:44,080
much about that kind of instability in
any particular oil supplier.

83
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,580
So what happens in the oil market is
when there's a disruption in one country

84
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,850
of the world that reduces their oil
supplies,

85
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,390
their ability to supply the global
market to supply consumers like us in

86
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:58,630
the United States,
when there's that kind of a disruption,

87
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,030
other suppliers compensate.
So suppliers that aren't comp,

88
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,060
that aren't disrupted see an opportunity
to make more money for themselves by

89
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,750
increasing their oil output to
compensate for the fact that one of

90
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,080
their competitors has reduced their oil
output.

91
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,030
So for example,
when a,

92
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,440
uh,
Libya exploded into civil war and then

93
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:31,240
us and European intervention rec to the
state institutions of that country and

94
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:36,040
made the civil war last,
not just a few months in 2011 but

95
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:41,041
persist for the last seven years,
such that Libyan oil output is way down

96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,160
millions of barrels a day down compared
to what it was before 2011 didn't lead

97
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,500
to a huge disruption of the oil market.

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,620
Didn't lead to a big price surge for
consumers like the United States.

99
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,220
Because other producers of oil like
Saudi Arabia,

100
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,560
like the United Arab Emirates,
like Mexico,

101
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,650
you know,
all around the world increased their

102
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:08,651
output to compensate for the fact that
Libya was producing less and so the

103
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:13,751
natural market reaction without the US
military doing anything enables

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,600
consumers to continue consuming in the
face of political military disruptions

105
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,970
of the oil market in one country around
the world.

106
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,110
So we don't need to try to use the
American military to protect the oil

107
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,650
markets because the market compensates
for disruptions.

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,310
And in fact,
our track record of using the US

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,560
military to protect the oil markets is
lousy.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,890
It often makes the problems worse,
not better.

111
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,600
And so there's a clear policy adjustment
the United States can make to stop using

112
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:49,601
the military for this purpose and that
would make Americans safer and continue

113
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,900
to give us a reliable oil supply.
