1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,720
I have followed baseball my life or
cognitive life,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
and it really is a fun sport and to me,
the baseball hall of fame as the

3
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:17,040
greatest hall of fame there is period
into paragraph,

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,150
so I wanted to write about it and wanted
to do a book and oversized

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,820
coffee table book,
stealing a line from one of the seinfeld

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,630
episodes.
It even comes with four legs in case you

7
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,210
need a coffee table.
Book,

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,080
Big Pictorial history.
I'm writing the history and I'm taking

9
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:45,081
the reader on a virtual tour through the
hall of fame and I am proud of the fact

10
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,830
that I got a blurb on the back from Yogi
Berra,

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,540
which reads what Bert sugar doesn't know
about baseball.

12
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,660
Nobody knows.
I have no idea what that means.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,760
I think it's Zen.
Might like,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,010
uh,
it's not worth knowing,

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,760
but Yogi makes sense.
I'm a Yogi is.

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,110
But Yogi,
I once asked you,

17
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,950
I said,
yolks.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,360
What did you mean when you said,
when you come to a fork in the road,

19
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,010
take it.
He said,

20
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,910
that's easy.
I live.

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,220
I live at the end of a circle.
Whether you go left to right,

22
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:25,221
you come to my driveway and I went,
he's making sense and if you parse

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,510
analyze yogi sayings,
he does make sense.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,750
He's credited with.
It's too crowded.

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,680
Nobody goes there anymore.
Well,

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,460
there's a story there that the Yankees,
after a night game,

27
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:45,930
we'll go out to dinner.
They'd be at the stadium early to either

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,960
go through the lineup of the opposing
team or get treated for some ailment or

29
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:54,720
wrapped their knees.
If it was mickey mantle or whatever

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,940
and after the game they'd all go out to
dinner and there was this one restaurant

31
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,720
in Cleveland that always was open and
always had a place for him after a game

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,910
and they all went there when it became
known that the Yankees eat here,

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,870
no advertising or word of mouth and they
went one time and there was no place at

34
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:20,781
the end for them so they didn't go there
anymore or go.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,570
It's too crowded.
Nobody goes there anymore.

36
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:28,230
Meaning us.
Yogi makes sense.

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,920
I really don't think steroids are as big
a problem as the presses made them,

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,610
and if they are,
we've got a picture on steroids.

39
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:41,550
Throwing to a batter on steroids is
hitting to a field or on steroids.

40
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,450
Um,
you're looking for not one upsmanship.

41
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:49,860
Tony Gwen will tell you,
years ago the padres used to have a bowl

42
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,210
of Ben Fetterman's and their clubhouse
like m's.

43
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:56,730
You pop them,
didn't help the padres at all.

44
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,650
And I've talented.
Ain't gonna help nothing.

45
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,710
Your talent am I getting be a little
edge,

46
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,250
but so will a spit ball.
Baseball was always dealt in edges.

47
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,610
The phillies used to raise their third
base,

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,490
foul line,
extra lime.

49
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,550
So that Richie Ashwyn's bunks with state
there,

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,620
the Cleveland Indians used to grow the
grass higher at third base.

51
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,900
So Al Rosen,
the third baseman wouldn't break his,

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,200
his nose or his fingers on every ground
ball.

53
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:31,150
It would slow it down.
Nineteen 62 playoffs between the dodgers

54
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:33,550
and the giants.
By that time,

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,820
Los Angeles dodgers,
San Francisco giants,

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,930
they ordered the base pass so maury
wills couldn't get off to a fast start

57
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:44,830
and steel basis.
That's illegal.

58
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,080
Steroids aren't I,
you know.

59
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,980
All right.
I,

60
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,360
I don't get that excited about it.
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,120
You know,
and I'm so old that when I heard the

62
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,760
word drugs the first time I thought they
were talking about aspirin.
