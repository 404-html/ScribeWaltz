1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,863
The mob is very barely turned.
The best you can hope for with a mob is 

2
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,120
to calm them down a little,
but they'll,

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,010
they'll rarely turn.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
I think sometimes you have to walk and 
certainly choose your battles.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,980
You can't throw yourself against the 
wall constantly and survive.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,870
The way I think about integrity is to 
remember that at the end of the day,

7
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:35,650
there's only one person I have to sleep 
with and that's myself and am I going to

8
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:39,800
be able to at the end of the day,
feel that I acted with integrity.

9
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:40,634
I feel like I treated other people well,
that I upheld principles that I really 

10
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,510
care about.
And that on some days can be really,

11
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:47,344
really hard because it's not,
it's not the evil people who challenge 

12
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:53,770
your integrity.
It's the good people.

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,330
It's the people you like.
It's the people who mostly do the time,

14
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:02,590
do the right thing.
And what ends up happening is because we

15
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:06,790
have interests in our lives because 
we're interested in,

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,340
for example,
not unreasonably making more money,

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,590
uh,
wanting a more comfortable life,

18
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,540
wanting to take care of our friends and 
family.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,260
Those are the kinds of things that lead 
to corruption within systems,

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,050
lead to misuse of resources,
lead to people mistreating each other,

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,493
and it's not really very hard to call 
out when somebody who is known to be 

22
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,324
awful is doing something awful.
It's much harder when it's the good 

23
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:39,550
people around them cooperating or being 
complicit in that situation.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,110
We said that,
for example,

25
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,370
with the me too movement,
right?

26
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,204
Where people are now exposing 
individuals who have been known to be 

27
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,974
creepy and awful people,
but all the people around them decided 

28
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,414
not to stand up because it was too 
costly to them personally or because 

29
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,820
they have the attitude of it's not their
job to stand up.

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,083
So I think one of the things you have to
ask yourself as you think about whether 

31
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:07,941
or not to call out bad behavior is can 
you get other people to do it with you?

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,033
That will often help lighten the blow of
the backlash and then can you afford to 

33
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:21,640
lose what it is you might lose.
And for some of us,

34
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,700
we can afford that.
So in my own life for example,

35
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:25,534
I've been able in many circumstances to 
go ahead and call out bad behavior 

36
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,720
because I have the resources to survive 
the backlash,

37
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,453
but

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I always try to think of at the end of 
the day and at the end of my life when I

39
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,250
look back will I feel like I did the 
right thing.

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,503
And that to me is really important.
I was raised in a conservative Roman 

41
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,990
Catholic family.
And so the message to my from my parents

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,940
all the time,
especially for my dad was always,

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,170
you know,
if you do the right thing,

44
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,400
he go to heaven.
If you do the wrong thing,

45
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,620
you go to hell.
Well,

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,200
I never had faith.
It never worked for me.

47
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,034
So I became an atheist very cognitively.
By the time I was about probably 14 and 

48
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,870
certainly by 16 and 18 I knew that I had
no belief in heaven and hell.

49
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,123
So then there was the question,
how do you make sure you do the right 

50
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,294
thing?
And for me it was really clear because 

51
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,600
my mother had said to me,
you know,

52
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,580
all the dog when the world you don't 
really need,

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,650
at the end of the day what you need is 
to know did you treat other people well?

54
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,023
Did you take care of injustice?
And for me that was a very clear 

55
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,510
organizing principles.
So for me,

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,760
I'm not thinking about what happens 
after I die.

57
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,850
I'm thinking about the end of the day 
and the end of my life and thinking if I

58
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,684
look back,
will I feel good about what I did or 

59
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,894
will I feel crummy about what I did?
And Catholicism irritates me for many 

60
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,980
reasons,
but one of the reasons that irritates me

61
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,920
is because it has the confessional 
booth.

62
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,754
And what?
What happens when you've done something 

63
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,710
that lacks integrity is you go into the 
confessional booth and you tell somebody

64
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,200
who had nothing to do with the situation
that you did it in.

65
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,400
That person forgives you.
That's I'm sorry.

66
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,260
Shitty system.
You can bleep it out if you have to.

67
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,100
That's a system in which you.
You're.

68
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,120
There isn't really accountability,
right?

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Where somebody is able to just let you 
off the hook and if you're going to live

70
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,004
with integrity,
you need to not have that ability to go 

71
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,510
by the little ticket and get out of jail
free,

72
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,150
you know,
do your seven hail Marys and beyond your

73
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:28,984
way.
You need a situation where you have an 

74
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,380
inner voice that says,
well,

75
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,660
you did that badly and you need to make 
good on it,

76
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,613
and then you go and you apologize to the
person you hurt not to the priest and 

77
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:41,740
you go and you promised not to do it 
again,

78
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,940
not to God,
but to the person.

79
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:46,210
You did it too.
And then you have I think,

80
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,870
moral accountability on the earth,
which is where we live.

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,900
The moral experience.
We don't live it in the afterlife.

82
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,320
Every time I've ever called out bad 
behavior,

83
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:57,154
I've been called bad every single time 
when I called out the FDA on 

84
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,224
inappropriate behavior,
when I challenged the office for human 

85
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,104
research protections,
when I named Cornell and Mount Sinai 

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,513
medical school is participating in 
problematic human subjects research on 

87
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,914
pregnant women.

88
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,443
When I at my local newspaper reveal that
city council made deals that they 

89
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,664
shouldn't have made that were not in the
best interest of the taxpayers over and 

90
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,280
over and over again.
I've been called bad.

91
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,870
Um,
you know,

92
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,704
there was one time in my life that there
was some kids that were acting 

93
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,460
incredibly violently at the bus stop and
everybody turned to me and said,

94
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,470
alice has to fix this because alice 
fixes everything.

95
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,870
And so because I'm the New Yorker in the
Midwest,

96
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:41,704
so I fix everything right.
And the person who is expected to be 

97
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,540
obnoxious and cost stuff out because I'm
a New Yorker.

98
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:51,541
So that's what I do.
So I ended up trying to deal with this,

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,073
trying to call the school system,
which didn't help trying to deal with 

100
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,680
the family,
which didn't help.

101
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,514
And ultimately one day just lost it and 
drag one of these kids home and 

102
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:00,884
presented them to the parents who were 
not at the bus stop is they were 

103
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:04,910
supposed to be in.

104
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,890
The father throttled me and I'm in front
of the kids,

105
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,290
which was rough for me because it's one 
thing to be throttled.

106
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,124
It's another thing to scare a bunch of 
kids and I had to do a lot of soul 

107
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,480
searching about the question of whether 
or not I should have bothered right,

108
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,003
particularly because everybody in the 
neighborhood kept coming to my front 

109
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,640
door wanting to tell me how bad they 
felt about this,

110
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,820
but they wanted me to take care of them 
because they were feeling bad about this

111
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,940
and I thought to myself,
well,

112
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,130
like at what point do we say it's my job
to fix all the bad stuff in the world,

113
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,803
but maybe if more of us thought it was 
maybe if more of us had that New Yorker 

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,730
voice in our heads rather than the 
midwestern voice in our heads,

115
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,370
the New Yorker voice to me saying,
do get involved.

116
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,200
The midwestern boy says,
don't get involved.

117
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,730
Don't get involved.
Don't get involved.

118
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,610
If more of us had the attitude of,
well,

119
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,540
maybe it is our job to step up and stand
up to injustice,

120
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,823
then the pain of it would be distributed
better and we might get things done 

121
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:06,764
faster.
The reality of standing up in terms of 

122
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,570
integrity is people often back away and 
say,

123
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:12,404
oh,
well you have the personality or you 

124
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,040
have the resources and you have the 
privilege so you can do this,

125
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,874
but I can't do it.
And the reality of whistle blowing and 

126
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,970
and doing exposing of injustice is that 
you're often alone.

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,840
Mm.
