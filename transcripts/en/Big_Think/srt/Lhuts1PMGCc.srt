1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,680
If I gave one piece of advice

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,060
to the world about how to avoid
diseases,

3
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
I would say have clear lines of
definition and demarcation and that

4
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:28,641
makes it sound like I'm recommending
exercise as number one because I want

5
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:34,461
the absence of fat under the skin.
I think that is the single most powerful

6
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,510
generator of most diseases.
It affects cholesterol,

7
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:42,060
it affects triglycerides,
that affects diabetes,

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,600
therefore dialysis,
therefore blindness,

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,150
therefore amputation.
It affects cancers and so on.

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,450
So the best way to do that is of course
to put diet and exercise together as far

11
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,600
as,
um,

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,880
uh,
immunizations.

13
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,410
Frankly,
that's a question,

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,420
uh,
in our culture that is mostly immunize

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,110
those people who choose not to get
immunized or sort of living off the

16
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:14,580
benefits of those who did because the
disease incidence is low,

17
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,240
but there have been several studies to
show that whooping cough epidemics have

18
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:23,130
begun to occur in those populations who
have not been immunized or adequately

19
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,910
immunized or recently enough been
immunized and whooping cough is nothing

20
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,780
to fool around with.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,930
Frankly,
my children are grown and I don't know

22
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,810
what I would do if the question were
asked me now,

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,470
uh,
do you want your kids immunized for all

24
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,180
of the things they're doing?
I will say this,

25
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,110
I would spread it out a little bit.
I don't think you need to jump in and

26
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:48,111
the first week or month and start the
immunization process as for seat belts

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,030
and,
uh,

28
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,580
you know,
avoiding too much sun and hence

29
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,500
melanoma.
You shouldn't be in the sun.

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,960
Vitamin D levels are very low in our
culture.

31
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,290
You should be in the sun before 11:00 or
after 1:30.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,620
Uh,
and you need a great deal.

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,840
You need a high vitamin D low.
You should not avoid the sun.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,730
You should be in the sun.
What's happened?

35
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,880
If you've already developed a skin
cancer of some variety,

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,300
then you really need to think about
taking vitamin D as a supplementation in

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,000
our western culture.
I think virtually everybody should

38
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:29,001
probably be on vitamin D.
I've never seen one person who had a 25

39
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,670
hydroxy vitamin D,
three level of 80,

40
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,430
which is considered more or less the
best level.

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,110
Everybody in my practice of thousands of
patients is below that number,

42
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,260
so I think just across the board,
people need vitamin D.

43
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,370
I've seen a few people in the seventies,
uh,

44
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,350
but uh,
not missing.

45
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,980
Everybody has a genetic predisposition
to develop multiple disorders,

46
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,310
but those disorders occur if only if the
person does what's necessary to express

47
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,300
that weakness.
So those people who are exercising

48
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,460
adequate,
virtually everyone who follows an

49
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,370
organic,
unprocessed whole foods diet that the 87

50
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:17,371
point five percent level and who
exercises a an hour a day is going to

51
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,580
have the kind of physique that I've just
recommended.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,710
And of course that's a lot of time and
people say,

53
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,860
who has the time,
pay me now or pay me later,

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,880
do what you're supposed to.
And then you'll find out that you'll

55
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,870
avoid diseases.
Dr. Visit a high copays,

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,690
high health insurance being rated by
your insurance,

57
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,200
having surgery and so on and so on.
So if you put the time in,

58
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,470
now it's sort of like an education.
You put the time and now you get the

59
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,460
benefit down the road,

60
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,860
you should get a rectal examination for
cancer.

61
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,820
Of the prostate,
I think thermography is a better way for

62
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,821
women to go than mammograms.
It's a heat registering technique that

63
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,220
gives no radiation.
There is a time and a place for a

64
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,070
mammogram.
There's a time and a place for an MRI

65
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,220
and of course now the big hot news about
cat scans and so on is that they are

66
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,880
cancer generating at about one in 500.
So I'm a.

67
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,740
people over the age of 50 should get a
colonoscopy and people should be doing

68
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:28,741
stool blood for a Globan Glo bin or
what's called a cult blood,

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,500
uh,
to detect cancers of the bow.

70
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,010
If you have stomach distress and
intolerance,

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,760
you might need to be checked for a bug
in your stomach called h dot pylori or

72
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:44,761
wheat allergy called CELIAC disease.
So these are some of the kinds of

73
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,720
things,
but everybody should get their

74
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,680
cholesterol checked.

75
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,930
Everybody should get their diabetes
checked.

76
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,200
There are 25 hydro a diabetes test
called an a,

77
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,540
one c,
they should get cholesterol,

78
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,360
which should be less than 1:50.
Triglycerides,

79
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,090
which should be less than 100.
A one C,

80
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,980
which should be less than five point
five,

81
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,300
25 Hydroxy d three,
which should be right around 80.

82
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,810
And those are some of the biochemical
tests that might be of interest for

83
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,770
people.
Um,

84
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,460
but,
uh,

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,910
we've mentioned a colonoscopy,
mammogram,

86
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,610
rectal examination,
pap and pelvic for women.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,330
Uh,
I do think that as much as I have

88
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:30,331
hesitancy about the injection of foreign
proteins called immunizations,

89
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,360
if I had a daughter,
I probably would want her immunized for

90
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,600
HPV.
Uh,

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
but again,
I wouldn't rush into it,

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,260
but once you became sexually active,
I would certainly want to have a

93
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:45,010
discussion until she made a final
decision whether or not it should be my

94
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,560
decision at this point.
So she doesn't have a voice in,

95
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,940
uh,
that,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,980
uh,
is a different discussion.

97
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Disease reversal is not impossible.
You can reduce the weight of diabetics

98
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,870
and for all apparent reasons,
uh,

99
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,360
hi.
Uh,

100
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,230
their diabetes goes away.
You can do the same for high blood

101
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,290
pressure.
You can,

102
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,710
for lack of a better word,
put it in quotes.

103
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,180
Cure.
There are doctors who argue against that

104
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:22,550
saying that you cannot cure.
I'm a hypertension.

105
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,250
You cannot cure diabetes,
you cannot cure high cholesterol.

106
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,930
Well,
it's very academic,

107
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,210
whether you want to argue about can you
cure it or not,

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,380
I can make all the signs of it go away
or reduce a person to Claude,

109
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,750
clear lines of definition and
demarcation.

110
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,090
Most diabetes will go away.
The vast majority of hypertension will

111
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,220
go away.
Then of course,

112
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:44,660
you have to address salt.
A salt intake has to be comparatively

113
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:46,230
low.
Um,

114
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,530
and uh,
um,

115
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,760
you have to address exercise.
So I believe that for the most part,

116
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:58,860
diabetes can be reversed.
Almost 90 percent of high cholesterol

117
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,500
can be reversed.
Virtually 95 percent of high

118
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:05,420
triglycerides can be reversed.
Um,

119
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,850
cholesterol,
blood pressure,

120
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:09,790
diabetes,
cigarette smoking.

121
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,160
Uh,
it's been shown time and time again.

122
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:16,150
If you stopped smoking,
the cells in your lungs begin to change

123
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:19,090
back to what they should have been and
so on.

124
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,703
Plus,
you'll reduce,

125
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,960
when you do all these things,
you reduce back pain,

126
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,700
you reduce depression,
uh,

127
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:29,350
you reduce a predisposition to accident.
Overweight people have more accidents.
