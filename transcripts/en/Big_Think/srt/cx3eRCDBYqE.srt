1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,050
Gosh,
if I answer this like completely honest,

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,280
like it's just going to be like some
Corny Shit,

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,690
you know,
it's going to be like,

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
um,
I,

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,020
I'm sincerely interested,
um,

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,050
and how the mind works and in these,
um,

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,800
kind of
universal,

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,010
timeless curiosities that man has always
had.

9
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,170
Essentially,
why are we here?

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,320
What are we doing?
What's this all about?

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,890
I'm really kind of depressing
curiosities that,

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,700
um,
for me have been answered,

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,610
um,
through,

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,690
um,
exploring psychedelics.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,550
So,
and you know,

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,140
you can decide if you want to edit all
this however it went.

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,350
But I grow my own mushrooms and develop
relationships with a lot of different

18
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:25,561
plants in order to find some kind of
insight and answers

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,010
to those curiosities about why we're
here and what's this all about.

20
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,850
And I don't do drugs recreationally at
all and I don't,

21
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,050
you know,
just trip out and enjoy the world here.

22
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,260
What I do is go in to my own mind as
deeply as possible to find

23
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,050
answers and then come back
and I know what to do.

24
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,910
And I know that sounds incredibly corny,
but that's the answer.

25
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,200
Um,
and that's why,

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,980
um,
for instance,

27
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm trying to create,
work that up.

28
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,350
Yeah.
That reflects that psychedelic

29
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:29,200
experience through kind of the fractal
based,

30
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,740
um,
construction of the picture plane.

31
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,780
And,
um,

32
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,400
one of the things I've learned is to,
um,

33
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,770
create my own world and share that
with as many people as possible,

34
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,850
you know,
understand what makes me unique and then

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,150
share that and inspire others.
So maybe answer is inspired,

36
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,360
you know,
the desire to inspire others inspires,

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,950
inspires me.
Yeah.

38
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:09,784
You know,
the,

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,000
the aesthetics are almost kind of the,
uh,

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,480
you know,
a,

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,650
a superficial reflection of the
experience or experiences.

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,670
Um,
they are,

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,330
to some degree that aesthetic Trojan
horse,

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,970
um,
you know,

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,540
the kind of psychedelic colors and
compositions.

46
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,940
Um,
I,

47
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,760
um,
I think are,

48
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,381
are,
are,

49
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:42,130
are beautiful,
but that's not the real message.

50
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,530
That's not the real content.
That's just the,

51
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,840
the form,
you know,

52
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,740
that's just the,
the,

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,790
the,
the beauty that brings you in,

54
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,624
I think.

55
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:56,850
Yeah.
