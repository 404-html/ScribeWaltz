00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,843
MMM,

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,760
yeah,
we all,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,440
all of us have a creative process and
part of it is the structure that the

4
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:15,570
advertising business itself gives us.
You know,

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:19,290
we,
we do what we call a strategic document

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,190
and that document gives us all the
bricks that we need to build a house.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,190
It's like the architecture plan to build
a house,

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,580
but then eventually it all comes down to
you and your partner.

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:32,580
We always work in teams.
Our art director,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,470
person in a writing person together.
Although those lines are blurred now and

11
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,460
then we sit down at 11:00 at night in
our offices trying to think of something

12
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:45,510
really brilliant that nobody else has
thought of before and that process

13
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:50,511
usually involves drinking a lot of water
and going to the bathroom because when

14
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:55,740
you go to the bathroom,
either in the bathroom or in the shower,

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,300
it's the one time you actually let your
brain relax enough to think of something

16
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,710
for you.
Otherwise,

17
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,280
if you're too stressed out and you're
working so hard to think of something,

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,960
your brain just kinda closes up on you.
So we have a lot of water in the agency

19
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,900
and every single time somebody comes
back from the bathroom,

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,520
they always say,
always,

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,670
always say when they come in the door,
I have an idea.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,610
It might not be the best idea or the
idea,

23
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:24,360
but it's an idea.
And it usually we feed on each other's

24
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:29,040
ideas and that's how we build a and get
to where nobody else has been.
