1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,040
I sat down to write this essay was the
first thing I ever wrote that wasn't

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,090
preschool to make sense to myself of why
it was so hard for women to say what

3
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,020
they felt or thought and be heard
without having it distorted and come

4
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:31,800
back to them in some way that just
didn't even sound like what they were

5
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:36,540
trying to say.
And also how come I hadn't seen the

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,210
absence of women from the psychology I
was teaching,

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,160
you know,
so I thought maybe my mother would read

8
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,860
this book or people who worked on the
same floor.

9
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:50,220
I worked on it at Harvard.
It never occurred to me,

10
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:55,221
but I wrote this paper and it started to
circulate like almost as a kind of

11
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,500
underground thing.
So it was.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,890
That was a huge discovery for me.
Just really huge.

13
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,630
I didn't expect it.
Harvard press,

14
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,630
when they publish the book,
they publish 3000 copies.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,480
Nobody expected.
It's had a huge impact.

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,650
It's had a huge.
I mean,

17
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:12,480
I'll tell you would like one good
example,

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,080
which is women used to be seen as
unintelligent because we were set to be

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,900
emotional.
You know,

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,370
men were rational and women were
emotional.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,810
Well,
you know,

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,920
honestly,
if you think about,

23
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:29,100
that's ridiculous because men have
feelings and women thing.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,800
So now we have this I phrase emotional
intelligence and it's a big vaunted

25
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,140
phrase because it's,
you know,

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,590
corporations are supposed to incorporate
it and people forget that.

27
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,300
Where that came from was this word
questioning this division between

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,710
emotional women and intelligent humans
and saying,

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,160
when you joined these qualities,
which had been seen as women's qualities

30
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:58,830
with human qualities there,
those are all human quality.

31
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:03,831
So we have emotional intelligence and
relational self and most recently the

32
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,500
feeling brain.
And that means that the whole paradigm.
