1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,590
Today
it's,

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,710
I'm trying to overcome American
dominance in the world,

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,420
are trying to overcome the American
military,

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,670
um,
bullying that's taking place here and

5
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,420
there in the world in Iraq and
Afghanistan and,

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,380
you know,
military bases in 100 countries.

7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,250
And I think people are trying to work
their way towards a more democratic

8
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:48,281
society wherever possible
and to do it without war.

9
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,390
And,
and I think this movement towards a more

10
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:59,150
democratic society,
society is more concerned with human

11
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:00,860
rights.
Oh,

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,890
we've already seen it begin to happen in
Latin America with movements from

13
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,910
autocratic and elitist states to more
populous states.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,440
And it may be that the European Union
represents this in some way.

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,380
And,
uh,

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,520
uh,
it's a longterm process.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,650
But I think,
you know,

18
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,670
what is going on is an attempt to create
a world which is different than the

19
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,900
world of the past hundred years,
which was a world of an incessant war

20
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,330
and domination of the world by
superpowers.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,510
First two superpowers.
And now one superpower.
