1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,040
That wouldn't bother with all the
football as

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,200
well.
I bumped in and it's got to be there

3
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:22,260
sort of head,
shoulders above anyone else,

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,730
terms of the way that hearing him as
influenced by.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,210
And then there's a whole battalion of
people,

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,460
everyone from Nina Simone's talk to Van
Morrison know,

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,600
uh,
Nick Drake is a Koan,

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,820
you know,
a Joni Mitchell.

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,500
It's just a,
as a whole sway that people like the

10
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,940
specials and the Qr code.
I was obsessed with the Kule for ages.

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,950
I love the smell of them live a couple
of times in the midnight sees that would

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,973
great.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,180
Yeah,
it was a couple.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,750
Actually.
A Walden was the water boys.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,230
This is the sea at Cardiff University.
Nineteen 85.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
Uh,
they just went straight through the

17
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:18,000
curfew and played for like three hours,
but that was such a brilliant record and

18
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,090
he was at the peak of his powers.
Mike Scott at that point,

19
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,470
he'd already written songs like
fisherman's blues and things that

20
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:29,490
appeared later and he played them at the
show and I remember instantly liking

21
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,290
that.
I've never heard it before.

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,830
And he played a couple of things.
He played a couple of covers and he just

23
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,960
went on and on and on,
but the way they will change the

24
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:39,140
instruments that,
uh,

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,890
I,
I love that show.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,570
And then the same year I went to
Glastonbury for the first time and the

27
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,220
cure headlined Saturday night,
uh,

28
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:52,260
that was the head of the door album,
which was a brilliant record,

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,080
but they just did a brilliant set and it
was,

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,250
and as it used to be,
not quite as clean and neat and tidy as

31
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,680
it is now,
but the pyramid stage,

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,250
they had a laser,
they used to be a laser,

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,150
the laser,
only the headline,

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,090
I could use it.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,400
So the cure got to use the laser and I
was there a bit out of my brains with my

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,580
little friend from school.
Um,

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,410
unless thunderstorm came into the moon
was going down and like the sun was of

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,780
other movements coming up.
The Sun was going down and then there's

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,500
just this huge storm came in and there
was thunder and lightning and all the

40
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,590
dry ice was being dragged across the
stage.

41
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:31,110
It just looked fantastic and they just
played through all the stuff.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,490
Yeah,
that was.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
That was amazing.
I was blown away by Glastonbury.

44
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,740
The whole thing of it.
I'm so obsessed by music.

45
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,870
I must have seen about 40 bands like the
cure was.

46
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,230
That was the.
