1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,170
What was the revolution,
I mean did in the 19 sixties,

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,690
um,
it was a sense of,

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,600
it was,
it was really a questioning of how had

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,610
this country
with this commitment to democratic

5
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,490
values justified,
you know,

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,250
a series of prejudices and tolerances
including,

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,170
um,
treatments of,

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,560
of women as less than fully human women
couldn't have a bank account.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,510
Women couldn't have a credit card,
you see,

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,490
you don't remember that.
And I remember teaching at Harvard,

11
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:53,790
there were no women on the faculty.
Um,

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,390
and that all changed.
That changed relationships between men

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,300
and women.
And the issue I was talking about

14
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:04,860
before,
which was for a woman to feel that what

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,850
I know or what I believe or what I think
or what I feel or what I want is

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,280
legitimate.
And it's not the only thing,

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,310
but it has legitimacy of its own,
was huge rather than seeing it as

18
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,214
selfish.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,080
Now that of course if you've been at you
introduce want or desire,

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,090
you introduce sexuality and you know,
in the old sort of framework,

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,620
women were seen as not wanting.
Sex is not sexual beings.

22
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:38,490
It's not having desires and thoughts of
their own quota.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,760
Funny Authority on this,
which is Freud who said that the so

24
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:46,761
called intellectual inferiority of women
was due to their needing to suppress

25
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:52,140
their sexuality.
Because if you couldn't think about all

26
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,080
aspects of yourself,
you had to start restricting how that

27
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,430
you could think at all.
And also I would say having to distance

28
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:04,050
yourself from your body because your
body was seen as somehow bad or wrong.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,330
You lost touch with your experience and
then it was very easy for women to not

30
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:14,331
know what they knew through experience
and to be open to all kinds of.
