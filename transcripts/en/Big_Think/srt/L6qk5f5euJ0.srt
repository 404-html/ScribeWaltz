1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
I
didn't know much about the real problems

2
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:10,540
in the country.
I'd say that,

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,810
I mean there are problems of race that
we hardly knew existed in San Francisco,

4
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,470
but they were right in front of us and
gradually got to see what they were.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,190
I can remember my mother telling me one
day she had a friend who was black and

6
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:27,620
they wanted to go to a restaurant for
lunch and they were going to go to the

7
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,890
St Francis Hotel and they were
discussing whether they could.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,870
And that was San Francisco.
That wasn't the south.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,100
There is not a magic answer.
Uh,

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,071
you know,
I,

11
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:42,730
I,
I'm probably since I recently wrote it

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,320
to sand in the,
in the,

13
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:44,861
uh,
in,

14
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:49,861
in a case involving
the use of race conscious criteria in

15
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,460
schools.
That is whether the city of Seattle

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,820
could use a,
a,

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,090
a,
as one criteria among several.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,150
They allowed high school students
freedom to choose whatever school they

19
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:06,070
wanted.
They listed preferences,

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,000
but they said that no school will be
more than 85 percent white.

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,870
Basically that was their criteria.
And the question was,

22
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:18,580
could they actually overtly in that way
use a racial criteria and the court five

23
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:19,420
to four,
uh,

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,870
decided that they could not,
they could not.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,130
I descended,
I thought,

26
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,010
of course I can at work consequences
relevant there.

27
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,990
They certainly were to me,
as I said,

28
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:31,710
if you interpret the equal protection
clause to,

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,320
uh,
into,

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,390
uh,
for bid,

31
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:39,391
this is how are people supposed to deal
with problems of race and poverty in the

32
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:44,881
inner cities of America.
And I see the constitution as a very

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,450
workable document.
I think Madison's genius was to say

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,710
we're going to get these values will
stay the same and we're going to embody

35
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:57,970
them in words that allow their
application over the course of the next

36
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:01,660
four or 500 years and if not,
if not longer.

37
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,350
And to do that,
you have to refer back to how do these

38
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,700
values apply today?

39
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,100
What's the value of the equal protection
clause?

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,430
Trying to bring us together,
trying to create one nation,

41
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,540
trying to create races that were
separate indeed one held in slavery like

42
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:21,520
a caste system and try to create one
country out of this diversity and it's a

43
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,440
miracle.
But we've been able to do that to a

44
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,750
degree.
There's still plenty of problems.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,940
And for me to think of that clause being
posed as an obstacle to such an effort.

46
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,800
Uh,
well I just think that that was wrong.

47
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:36,430
And I expressed my views very concisely
in about 77 pages.

48
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,290
I'm basically optimistic even with the
thing I was most pessimistic about,

49
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:45,270
to go back to read a specific case.
I W I was most pessimistic about the

50
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:49,950
court's decision in the Seattle case
involving the use of race conscious

51
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,290
criteria.
I think about that seriously.

52
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,280
I was in a descent.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,440
I think it's a bad decision.
That's what I wrote.

54
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,970
Uh,
the,

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,730
the,
uh,

56
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,360
uh,
impedes the ability of

57
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,130
communities to,
uh,

58
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,850
take people who were isolated in the
center of the city,

59
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,260
very poor family background could be
terrible and,

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,920
uh,
lacking opportunity and try to work out

61
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,000
the problems in the,
in the,

62
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,970
in the community context.
So I think this is a bad decision.

63
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,300
It's a throwback,
but it's only a throwback to see because

64
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,370
really,
ultimately I am an optimist.

65
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,610
And ultimately I do think that people
overcome even this kind of a barrier and

66
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,810
people figure out how to solve these
problems.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,810
Not perfectly,
but we'll do it.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
The country itself is becoming much more
of a diverse country and yet we will

69
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,460
cooperate.
We cooperate,

70
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,200
we know how to do it.
That's really,

71
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,820
I think are,
are great.

72
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,700
Uh,
uh,

73
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,520
if there's an American contribution,
I think it's in that respect,

74
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:02,521
the respect of being open and coming
into a problem and not being prejudiced

75
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,451
about it and trying to look for whatever
solution arises out of the problem.

76
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,020
It's a pragmatic attitude.
It's an attitude that is not a respecter

77
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:18,400
of persons.
It's a respecter of problems and we

78
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,470
don't just take what people say

79
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,230
for me.
