1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,090
It is argued,
tend to like younger women tend to like

2
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:19,460
particular figures like large hips
visits that are good for childbearing

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,570
and large breasts that are good for
breastfeeding.

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,050
Uh,
and women tend to like strong,

5
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,410
masculine,
big shouldered men who can take care of

6
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:30,540
their child and them.
Uh,

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,180
and there may be some truth to that kind
of thing.

8
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,740
I think that it's,
it's,

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,820
it's too neat of a system.
There are lots of popular books written

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,200
that way.
Lots of,

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,820
uh,
when I teach undergraduates,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,830
they love those socio biological notions
because it's just a nice,

13
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,520
neat little system.
Uh,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,490
but I think it's too neat.
I think that,

15
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:53,280
uh,
and it varies from culture to culture at

16
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:55,440
different points in our own culture.
Uh,

17
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,780
we have,
uh,

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,170
we've put on a pedestal more corpulent
women,

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,600
uh,
n and D and cultures.

20
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,870
For example,
the perfect body style for a woman a is

21
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,090
not the hourglass figure,
but more of a,

22
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,790
of a squat square figure.
Uh,

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,410
so it's,
it's,

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,890
it's too easy for us to extrapolate from
cultural,

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,240
current cultural norms and then say,
this is some sort of evolutionary

26
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,670
propensity.
Um,

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,490
there do seem to be more pairings of
older,

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,340
older,
wealthy men and younger,

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,203
uh,
women,

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,730
uh,
which evolutionary theory would lead us

31
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,850
to believe.
But you also am always struck by a

32
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,420
newspaper reports of older women going
out with younger men.

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,180
And you see more and more of that these
days.

34
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,760
And that's,
that's not at all what evolution would,

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,600
would have his thing.
