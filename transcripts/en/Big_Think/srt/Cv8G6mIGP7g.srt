1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,710
I think this is one of the major
unknowns about Obama.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,420
He in some ways has to succeed within a
very traditional broadcast style of

3
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,951
politics and governance.
But there's also the outlines of the new

4
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:32,250
system.
And I think the new part is coming from

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,700
a fact that's actually even bigger than
Obama and our preoccupations in

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,180
electoral politics.
And that's the,

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,460
the falling costs for people with the
same interest to share information and

8
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:50,400
collaborate and find each other in the
first place.

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,020
That is what's changing the world,
the falling cost for likeminded people

10
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,150
or locate each other,
share information,

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,600
do something with it,
and then tell the rest of the world.

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,770
And whether you are campaign recognizes
it or not,

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,400
that is out there and it's happening.
And so there's no doubt that an American

14
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:20,091
government realizing this shift could
operate in a different way than our

15
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,020
government does now.

16
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,000
And there are people who want to make
that transition happen,

17
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,001
who want to see the age,
not an internet fundraising and

18
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:40,740
organizing a campaign over the web,
but something much more profound,

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,800
which would be government of the people,
by the people.

20
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:48,060
And for the people in which the people
actually have the same information

21
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,190
available to them that the government
has

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,840
and that kind of openness,
that kind of transparency is certainly

23
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:03,621
going to change government eventually.
But we really don't know if the election

24
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,940
of Obama would bring it on.
We didn't really don't know at all if he

25
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:13,941
would govern any differently then Bill
Clinton or for that matter George Bush,

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,430
it's,
it's there as a kind of a,

27
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,390
as a kind of a under tone
and as potential,

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
but the rest remains to be seen and we
have this problem about talking about

29
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:35,781
change when it comes to technology and,
and these big shifts is we ask,

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,400
you know,
whether it's going to be one or the

31
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,700
other where we ask it if it's,
you know,

32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,740
the Internet is taking over or really
not much of a factor at all is we have

33
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,180
to have some more complex images here.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
You know,
it's sort of like they're still running

35
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:54,120
the old stadium,
but they're building the new one writer,

36
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,860
you know,
right around it.

37
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,770
And how we function in both worlds at
same time.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,300
The old broadcasting system is still
there for much of the country and much

39
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:08,680
of the campaign is being run through it
and then underneath it or around it,

40
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:13,000
there's this new distributed system of
sort of many to many of the politics and

41
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,420
media and it the two interact with each
other.

42
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,050
So I think we're going to continue to
see that.
