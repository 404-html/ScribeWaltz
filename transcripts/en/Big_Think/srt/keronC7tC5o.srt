1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,900
I think that there will always be small
scale scandals.

2
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:13,740
There were always be plagiarist.
There will always be people who didn't

3
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,780
make the phone calls that they claim to
be made.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,810
But the chronic repeated abuse that
Jason Blair was engaged,

5
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,810
and I don't think it happened at a
newspaper that has a public editor or an

6
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,280
ombudsman.
Um,

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,350
yes,
there was a phone number published in

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,620
the newspaper in The Times every day for
people to call if they had something

9
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,950
that they objected to.
And when I got there I thought I'd try

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,910
out the system.
Well,

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,880
it's a mailbox full.
Nobody had been paying attention to it.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,680
If you have somebody whose job is
specifically to respond to readers who

13
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:47,040
are complaining or who are pointing out
error or pointing out misbehavior on the

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,410
part of reporters,
it's very hard.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,630
I can't imagine that it would not be
caught after the second or third time

16
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,960
because you know,
somebody reading that mail,

17
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,260
somebody is paying attention to it.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,850
My biggest concern about the digital
technology as it's coming to the

19
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,700
newsreel is anonymity of writers.
Um,

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,050
whether that's the person who's writing
a blog or who's commenting,

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,890
uh,
on,

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,290
on a sign on assigned blog,
uh,

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,030
we don't know who those people are.
And,

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,680
um,
one thing,

25
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,320
and this is not an ethical issue,
this is a question of stability and

26
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:22,921
taste.
I mean,

27
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,940
it allows cowards to hide,
uh,

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,060
behind,
um,

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,370
that,
that scrim while they have the freedom

30
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:35,760
to say really awful and disgusting
things and I can't stand that.

31
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,370
It's very upsetting to me.
Uh,

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,870
but beyond that,
there have been a few instances where

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,250
that person who's been commenting on
this website or that website in fact as

34
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,020
a principal in the story,
uh,

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,380
is in fact a,
a figure who has a self interest.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,670
But as hiding that self interest,
uh,

37
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:54,870
I would really be delighted to see the,
uh,

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,420
the websites of the world just suddenly
declare,

39
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,450
put on your real name or we don't care
what you have to say.

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,190
And in fact,
I don't care what you or you shouldn't

41
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,470
care what I have to say if I'm not
willing to put my name behind it.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,730
I think that the,
the,

43
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,600
the peak years for,
for quality journalism in this country,

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,050
1970s and early 1980s,
uh,

45
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,960
if you go back before then,
I mean,

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,660
pick up a copy of the New York Times in
1965 Sunday,

47
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,690
it was unbelievably dull.
It was officially is if the PR,

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,460
there were a new Peruvian ambassador
appointed there.

49
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,130
It was in the paper.
Uh,

50
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,230
the shipping news that just the,
the sort of,

51
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,480
the kind of the deadly,
uh,

52
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,810
um,
required drone,

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,700
uh,
of news in those days was,

54
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,340
was really pretty awful.
The paper got much,

55
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,680
much better after that as an all
American journalism.

56
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,790
And I think the Watergate obviously had
a great deal to do with Watergate and

57
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,730
also the magazine writers of the 60s,
uh,

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
people like,
uh,

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,510
like gay Talese and David Halberstam who
move both came out of the Times but then

60
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,500
moved to other arenas to be able to do
more than simply chronicle.

61
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,890
They could write.
They did more of that coming together.

62
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,170
That,
and the great victory for journalism

63
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,760
that was Watergate,
uh,

64
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,340
created a,
I think in the 70s that attracted better

65
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:18,130
people to the industry.
It was a more exciting thing to do.

66
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,070
And they,
and people did their greatest work then,

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
and the standards were very,
very high.

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,050
Uh,
as we get into the 90s,

69
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,480
and we began to have an economic trouble
beginning to show up,

70
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,350
you know,
a Time magazine where I worked for quite

71
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,040
a while in 1990,
90 had eight full time critics on staff

72
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,630
doing different things.
Uh,

73
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,940
today I think there's one full time
critic,

74
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,803
and that's,
uh,

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
not the criticism is the most important
thing in the world,

76
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:47,170
but I use it as an indication of how
things have shrunk back because of the

77
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,250
economic problems.
