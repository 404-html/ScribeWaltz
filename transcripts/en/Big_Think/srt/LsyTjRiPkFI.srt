1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,730
I will do anything in my power not to be
pc,

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,840
a short of,
you know,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,360
being insulting a pc has its own
repressiveness just as much as any kind

4
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,420
of like sort of right wing
insensitivity.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,040
Um,
when I'm writing about people that it

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,940
might seem,
should be the territory of people like

7
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,820
the people you're writing from writing
about black characters or Hispanic

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,040
characters.
Uh,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,070
listen,
the only obligation of a writer whose

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,330
job is to imagine lives not your own,
is to make the characters is three

11
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:45,840
dimensional as possible.
If you can do that,

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,700
you know,
there's no one off limits.
