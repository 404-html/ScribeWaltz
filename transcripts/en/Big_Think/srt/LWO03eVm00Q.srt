1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,590
The idea of being a man has a change so
dramatically.

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,810
Right.
Um,

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,740
but particularly I think not just the
responsibilities of a being a father,

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,570
which is always been,
you know,

5
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:29,740
not to get all Kahleel Goubran.
Like these children are on loan to us

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:34,530
and we're supposed to make sure that we
take care of them and,

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,510
and we're the stewards of these human
beings,

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,910
male roles,
which is something I do,

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,320
you know,
my wife and I have written about in the

10
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:49,321
show because the concept of a father
today is dramatically different.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,310
I mean,
obviously it's different in every family

12
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:57,550
culture,
but it's different from a generation

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,780
ago.
And the idea of what a father's

14
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:04,400
responsibility,
whether it's coparenting,

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,660
whether it's a stay at home dad or just
someone that does lip service to the

16
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:14,851
idea of sharing responsibility is so
different from 1910 and you know,

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,100
like the,
you know,

18
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:24,550
I have this joke where it's like,
and then you go back to caveman and

19
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,470
they're literally eating their children.

20
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,590
I think it's,
it's perspective on how we treat women,

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,620
right?
That is the beginning and the ending of

22
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:40,930
it.
We are animals.

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,020
I start from that premise and we choose
to not behave like animals.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,790
And that's,
you know,

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,200
a pretty guiding force through humanity,
whether it,

26
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,430
it gets completely out of control or
just panting like a dog when a,

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
uh,
an attractive woman walks by.

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,190
You know,
I even look at like pornography and all

29
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:14,740
this stuff where it's,
yeah.

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,880
You know,
it's like,

31
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,290
look,
I love naked women.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I really do.
But I also know that I'm a visual human

33
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:26,350
being and,
and I can't,

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,640
uh,
you know,

35
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,780
I can't consume images of naked women
and not have that influence how I view

36
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,580
other women.
I mean,

37
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,500
that's my personal opinion.
I don't,

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,510
so like it's like my sexual desires are,
are very valid and real.

39
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,480
But if I,
if I,

40
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,650
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,150
followed through on every sexual desire,
first of all,

42
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,830
I'd have a thousand children.
No,

43
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,831
but I think then that's not how you,
that's not how you get,

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,070
um,
I wouldn't feel very good.

45
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,383
Do you?
I mean,

46
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,310
when I look at my young sons,
I think that,

47
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,710
look,
I know that we love and like the

48
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,350
normalization of porn.
And I'm not,

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,033
uh,
you know,

50
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,940
it's like t each their own,
right?

51
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,660
But I don't think that I want my sons
consuming pornography.

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,150
I would want my sons to look at an
advertisement and say that is a

53
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,400
beautiful woman,
but she's being objectified.

54
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,180
And I do want even beyond that,
I personally think that,

55
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,910
uh,
in the United States we give credit and

56
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:59,911
appreciate attractive people too much.
And so I think that I want to instill

57
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,020
that.
I mean,

58
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,530
I think a lot of parents desperately
want to have nerdy children.

59
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,710
So,
but I dunno,

60
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,790
I want my kids to be a,
my sons to be better men than me.

61
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,030
But I think also,
you know,

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,570
it's different paths to getting there.
I mean,

63
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,590
look,
I'm Catholic.

64
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:27,160
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
But I think that's an important tool

65
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,980
also.
But I also think that,

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,510
you know,
understanding the logic and science

67
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,710
behind it is vital.
But culturally,

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,650
it's interesting.
I saw a clip of match game,

69
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,320
which was a show,
a game show when I was growing up from

70
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,080
the mid seventies eighties I don't know.
And the beginning of the show,

71
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:58,081
it was just filled with the host more or
less sexually harassing the female

72
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,510
contestants and it was not malicious and
that man did not know he was doing it.

73
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,390
And maybe those women didn't feel icky.
But from our standards today,

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,790
it was ridiculous.
I mean,

75
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,390
I also feel like to discredit everything
I've said,

76
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,410
I also think that I don't want us to get
to the point where there isn't passion.

77
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,870
Right.
You know,

78
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:28,630
when I met my wife and we went on our
first date,

79
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,730
you know,
I aggressively kissed,

80
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:37,600
or not in a monstrous way,
but even hearing myself describe it,

81
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,940
I don't know if we could do that today
and I'm sure I could have,

82
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:46,630
because there's,
there's a communication that's unspoken,

83
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,050
right?
When you're courting someone but

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,710
courting like it's the 18 hundreds like
you're riding a horse to meet them.

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,340
But there is something about,
there's rules,

86
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:05,201
but there's also,
what's so great about relationships is

87
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:10,661
that tingling feeling when the chemistry
that we can't articulate works.

88
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,310
Mm.
