1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,180
I think one huge mistake,
the gay community and I think of the

2
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:17,181
American community as a whole has made
is that HIV is a treatable disease and

3
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:21,900
thus contracting,
it is a nonissue.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,610
And while that may it be the case in
many a HIV positive,

5
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,790
people live long and quote unquote
healthy lives,

6
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,600
uh,
the cost and trauma to that person in

7
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,270
the family.
I wouldn't think anybody would

8
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,510
voluntarily want to sign up for.
Um,

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,430
I think there are institutions and you
know,

10
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,380
I,
I do credit and MTV,

11
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:47,730
which I have plenty of problems about,
but I will give them Kudos for raising

12
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,310
awareness about HIV and getting tested.
Uh,

13
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,570
I think the,
there's a huge part of that equation

14
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:57,150
missing.
What do you do when you get tested?

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,720
It's one thing to walk into a free
clinic and have your blood drawn.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,610
It's another thing for you to be told,
the results that you're positive.

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,080
And then there are zero marketing
messages about what goes on there.

18
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:14,160
And I think that that's a huge dilemma
I'm getting people tested is the first

19
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:14,994
part,
uh,

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,010
beyond that,
it's almost as if that,

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,060
that whole possibility has been ignored.
I do think,

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,350
especially in New York City,
that the,

23
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,930
uh,
did the use of crystal Meth,

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,290
uh,
has,

25
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,690
is resurging,
uh,

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,900
among young people and that leads to
plenty of unprotected sex.

27
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,100
And I think it is,
you know,

28
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:38,130
this carefree lifestyle.
But again,

29
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:43,131
I think it's up to each individual to
really make that call and to protect

30
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,870
themselves.
But there are so many industries out

31
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,640
there that can lend a helping hand.
