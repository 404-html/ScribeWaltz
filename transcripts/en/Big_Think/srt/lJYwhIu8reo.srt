1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,910
Incredible
the last day

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,760
have put America in such jeopardy in so
many ways.

3
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:26,320
I mean the fact of these trillions of
dollars of debt we have now,

4
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:30,190
that's going to be a huge burden to
arrive with the fact that global

5
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,500
warming,
as nothing has been done about it.

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,450
Even Mccain now says he's,
you think something has to be done about

7
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,790
it.
Lord knows he changes his mind so often.

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,210
We don't know how long that will stay,
but I'm,

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,210
I'm the Iraq war of course is a huge
issue.

10
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,550
And the economy,
unemployment,

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,200
immigration,
I mean the person who's job one should

12
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,110
really want,
um,

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,170
these are,
these are really incredible issues.

14
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:02,240
I think from what I've seen of him,
um,

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,480
his basic intelligence will allow him to
assemble a team.

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,150
I mean,
basically a president is a team.

17
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:15,151
It's hardly a single person will allow
him to assemble people to help begin

18
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:20,470
those problems.
And the fact that he's such an inspired

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,800
arbiter or some people almost hold
against him,

20
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,780
I think is very,
very crucial.

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,820
Very crucial at this time that someone
will be able to speak and convince

22
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:34,330
people what they have to do,
convince the country,

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,230
convince them that there's hope.
First of all.

24
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,350
I mean,
America has never apparently in all the

25
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:46,120
polls express so much of a lack of hope
in anything.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,820
And I think the fact that he is that
inspiring could be very,

27
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,210
very important.
Will be very assuming you went to

28
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,323
bruce.
I mean,

29
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,220
that's where Kennedy is remembered for
Kennedy made a lot of terrible mistakes.

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,520
But what he's remembered for is that,
that there was a moment when people felt

31
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:16,450
as though there were light.
I think that's partly,

32
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:19,090
that's a good part of what a leader
does.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,080
A leader finds the positive things,
finds what we can do.

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,500
Um,
the reason Bush's administration was so

35
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:34,501
despairing to so many of us was that it
was based in fear.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,240
It was a constant repetition of fear.
We have to be afraid of this.

37
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,950
So we have to do that.
We have to be afraid of that.

38
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:44,240
So we can do this.
And um,

39
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,150
and this is what's happened is that
people now are really in a state of

40
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:52,390
anguish,
didn't have to be that way.
