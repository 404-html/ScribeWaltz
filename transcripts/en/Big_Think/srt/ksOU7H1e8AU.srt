1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,970
Let's take the video of Philando
castile's death.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,010
So that was,
um,

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,780
shot by his,
um,

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,810
his fiance and her readiness with her
phone.

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:22,310
And her quick instinct to use facebook
live is very,

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,450
was very potent in that video.
People may remember that,

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,510
um,
she is watching her fiance bleed to

8
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:36,611
death and at the same time calling out
to two entities to witness her.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,740
The first is God and the second is
facebook.

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,750
So she wants our witness the purpose
that we as users,

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,470
as responsible users,
as humane users of the Internet have.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,500
Our responsibility is to bear witness in
that way.

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,180
Um,
not to experience it ourselves so much

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,270
as to testify to the fact of the fact
that it happened to serve as a massive

15
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:07,550
jury of peers who would,
who give credence to the experience of

16
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,740
other people.
And in that way,

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,920
I think that was a,
an extremely profound moment in the way,

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,520
crystallizing the way that we all use
facebook when we use it,

19
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,240
right?

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,040
Or use twitter when we use it.
Right.

21
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,760
You know you have Newt Gingrich even now
saying we don't have white white

22
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:30,140
Americans don't understand the
experience of black Americans and that

23
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:33,470
chasm,
that gap and understanding has been one

24
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,790
that the Internet is in large part
responsible for that.

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,000
There's a huge vocabulary.
There's a set of symbols.

26
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,070
There's,
you know what I think of as an idiom

27
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,460
set,
but also a testimony about experience

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,080
that we weren't,
that of each of each of us have each of

29
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,990
us in different dialects,
that we weren't allowed or we,

30
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,120
we didn't have access to communally
share.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,990
Now we are,
as some people say in this adolescence

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,900
with this,
with digital culture and we're trying

33
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:03,734
to,
to,

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,100
to determine what to do with this
infinitely polyglot culture speaks so

35
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,400
many different languages.
You know,

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,510
I was reading because why not?
I was reading Henry James as account of

37
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:21,581
being at Ellis Island at the beginning
of the last century and his horror at

38
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:27,251
what he calls the teaming and squirming
massive flooding onto into New York,

39
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,560
which now we would see as politically
appalling,

40
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,910
as a level of,
of,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,210
of disgust that goes hand in hand with
certain,

42
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,390
you know,
antiseptic right wing nativists

43
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,180
thinking,
especially coming from a waspy.

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,360
You know,
Henry James figure mirrors almost

45
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,450
exactly the vocabulary that people use
when they describe twitter.

46
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,460
When they described the youtube
comments.

47
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,460
These people are illiterate,
they're angry,

48
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:57,290
they're squirming and teeming.
That is a natural reaction to people who

49
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,150
feel like they belong here and their
spaces being seized by people whose

50
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,920
language they don't speak,
who are,

51
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,880
you know,
in many,

52
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,960
many ways alien to them.
But the Internet shows us over and over

53
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:11,140
again and the billions of us who use
facebook,

54
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,350
no,
that that exposure is not only necessary

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,390
but good for us,
but good for us.

56
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,690
It's exposing our immune system to test
over and over to different means that

57
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:27,010
confront our bodies the way microbes do
and raise our immune system.

58
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,650
Ask us to be more robust citizens.
