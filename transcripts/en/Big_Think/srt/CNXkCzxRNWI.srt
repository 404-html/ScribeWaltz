1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,820
For me,

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,620
you know,
when I was an artist,

3
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:15,621
a lot of what I did was collage.
I would bring together disparate

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,280
elements and then when they be,
when they got side by side,

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,170
there is a kind of magical child born
from those disparate elements.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,710
And that's my creative process.
So I'll bring in some music,

7
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:35,280
maybe unexpected music,
and I'll bring in some readings.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
I might take five books and just
randomly open to different pages.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,820
Um,
I might go for a walk.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,850
Uh,
and when these things are placed side by

11
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,380
side,
uh,

12
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,690
interestingly enough,
uh,

13
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:56,430
in the best of circumstances there's a
magical child and that's my creative

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:01,431
process is collage.
It's like being immersed in life rather

15
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,970
than separating yourself.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,940
A person that I look to for inspiration.
Definitely Sharon Gannon.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,740
Oh,
Sharon is the prime mover of Jeeva,

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,210
do yoga.
It was her,

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,710
her,
uh,

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,890
her magical child.
She,

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,300
um,
motivates me on a daily basis,

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,560
uh,
with her,

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
her high hopes and her,
um,

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,580
her optimism.
I tend to be a little bit pessimistic

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,760
and I get mired in that a little bit.
Uh,

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,080
what's the use?
And Sharon always brings me back,

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,180
uh,
to,

28
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,100
uh,
well,

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,000
what are you going to do right now in
the next few minutes?

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,050
What could you do to make the world a
better place?

31
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,930
And,
and she's constantly filled with new

32
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:58,440
ideas and new possibilities and new
projects.

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,260
So many projects I have to run to keep

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,570
[inaudible].
