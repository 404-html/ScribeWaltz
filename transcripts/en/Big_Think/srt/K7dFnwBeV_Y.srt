1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,440
I've got lots of things that,
that alarm me [inaudible] worry me and

2
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,700
concerned me.
And I am,

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm a rabid optimist.
Um,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,500
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,550
I,
I just keep seeing so many people doing

6
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,570
cool things.
I mean,

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,050
I met a guy,
have no idea whether this,

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,050
whether this technology is going to
prove out.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,710
Um,
but I met a guy last summer who's

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,620
working on a kind of concrete,
uh,

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,050
cement portland cement is the basic
cement.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,310
Portland cement is a real greenhouse gas
emitter.

13
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,910
I mean construction.
So,

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,690
you know,
I,

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,510
I don't know,
these numbers are going to be wrong,

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:57,511
but construction is 25% of greenhouse
gases and submit is 40% of construction,

17
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:59,680
something like that.
So it's a big deal.

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,000
And he is invented this cement that he
says,

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,150
I think he's calling in California
summit that has

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,390
one 10th,
again,

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,270
order of magnitude number,
um,

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,350
the,
the greenhouse gas emissions of this.

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,000
You're like,
wow.

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:16,720
You know,
I mean,

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,510
that's cool.
And then you hear Urbano speak,

26
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:23,170
and I've heard Bano speak to 10,000
people at my daughter's college

27
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:25,030
graduation.
And I've heard Bano speak to a group of

28
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:28,580
50,
30 something managers in a small room

29
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:33,010
and you think this is the most
charismatic man I've ever met.

30
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:36,860
And you think this is quite,
he's a rock star,

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,781
you know,
I mean,

32
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:38,850
you know,
and,

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,640
and you,
he knows you so smart and full of energy

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,240
and,
and,

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,580
and then you meet,
um,

36
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,380
people involved in,
in,

37
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:52,381
in healthcare who are not getting
involved in sort of sterile debates

38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,550
about,
well,

39
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,870
they're not out,
they're not sterile,

40
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:56,531
but,
but,

41
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:01,531
but highly politicized debates about
the healthcare policy in the United

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,091
States.
But her saying,

43
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:09,091
if we go and apply the principles of the
Toyota production system to the

44
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:14,740
management of hospitals,
we can reduce by 90% the number of

45
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:19,741
infections from introducing a central
line and we can improve by 50% the

46
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:23,530
outcomes for people who have,
who come into emergency rooms with heart

47
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,180
attacks.
Do you think if we just do this,

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,780
we,
and,

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,150
and,
and,

50
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,010
and,
and they do what,

51
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,280
uh,
we,

52
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,140
when you see this kind of,
uh,

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,120
of,
of activity,

54
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:35,260
you can't help but think
this is really cool.

55
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,090
I mean,
you can't help but be optimistic.

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,620
It's,
it's really exciting.

57
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:42,980
No.
