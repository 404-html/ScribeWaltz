1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,570
You know,
I don't think it will actually because

2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,210
it's still a great medium,
um,

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,590
until somebody invents a cheap
electronic paper different from a

4
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,870
kindle,
which I still think is too complex and

5
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:33,100
too expensive for the average person.
I think there's still going to be a

6
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:37,480
place for newspaper.
But what I do think is seven day a week,

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,160
large metropolitan papers or even
smaller community papers,

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,990
it's not viable based on the revenue
that's coming in that really we have to

9
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:49,600
start.
What you'll see is news organizations

10
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:54,190
that do not identify themselves with a
form of distribution.

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,140
They're information companies,
knowledge companies that then distribute

12
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,190
on video.
They distribute databases or they make

13
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:07,000
available databases.
They do print additions,

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,270
they do specialty magazines,
they do whatever works for the customer

15
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:17,350
and the advertiser and whatever makes
sense financially.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,960
And if it doesn't make sense to produce
something,

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,880
we're going to have to find financial
sense to do it.

18
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,350
We'll have to find a different way to do
it.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,810
We spent an enormous amount of money
doing things that don't have much value.

20
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,350
Like,
why does the New York Post and the New

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,350
York Daily News,
why do they have to have separate people

22
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,500
producing the NBA box scores in their
newspaper?

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,460
What added value for the customer are
they producing?

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Shouldn't we put our efforts where they
really provide value to the user?

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,900
Wherever the user is,
you know,

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,410
wanting to read it as kitchen table,
riding a bus,

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,320
you know,
being across halfway across the world

28
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,210
and wanting to know what's going on in
New York City.

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,500
W why can't we create value that way?
Um,

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,650
uh,
and I think we can because you can see

31
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,970
people paying for content,
but they pay for content that they

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,950
perceive provides them benefit or value,
entertainment or otherwise.

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,250
I think they'll become more of a
conversation along the line of a blog

34
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,610
where the reader participates and
expertise from outside starts to

35
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,350
moderate.
Um,

36
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,050
what,
what we see published.

37
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:37,090
You know,
if you look at Wikipedia,

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,740
wikipedia is a brilliant,
um,

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,680
and successful,
um,

40
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,700
media initiative.
I mean they've created a new form of

41
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:49,830
encyclopedia that's living,
it's breathing and,

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,800
and the idea of a wikipedia for a
community like shouldn't the local news

43
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:57,490
organization be the in depth resource
for a community?

44
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,750
So if you know more about care,
for example in healthcare financing and

45
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:04,810
health care insurance,
why shouldn't you be able to work with

46
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,950
me as we're explaining,
you know how the Obama administration's

47
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,140
healthcare policies will affect
Colorado.

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,510
So I think the involving of and bringing
people in will be a really important

49
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:20,290
part of whatever anything looks like
that this interactivity,

50
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,550
that conversation,
that inclusiveness that it's not us

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,640
telling you,
it's actually us working with you and

52
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,440
trying to understand and answer your
questions.

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,660
But you,
the reader will be answering questions

54
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,400
as well.
I think we're in a much more

55
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,900
participatory world.
I actually think that's better and we

56
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,770
might have more information,
but we have to think of ourselves maybe

57
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:49,390
as more curators and moderators and not
just as originators.

58
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,680
Typically with local media companies.
They thought they had to produce

59
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,440
everything.
That was the only way to trust anything.

60
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,520
I think we're in a different era.
The Internet is self policing.

61
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,730
There's ways that things can be
checked for accuracy because others look

62
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,670
at them and comment on them.
And so,

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,070
so I'm not pessimistic about the future.
I'm actually optimistic about it.

64
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,340
I just recognize,
I don't know what it's gonna look like.

65
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,720
And the solutions are not necessarily
going to come from the traditional media

66
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,480
companies,
whether their scripts or hearst or

67
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,460
mcclatchy or the New York Times.

68
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,310
Well,
they at least contribute to correcting

69
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,570
it because let's say,
um,

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,060
let's take healthcare and we have a,
a single payer,

71
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,460
uh,
somebody with a single payer perspective

72
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,640
to health insurance.
But then we have a free market and it

73
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,190
aren't,
shouldn't we be the people to encourage

74
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,670
dialogue and create an environment for
the dialogue?

75
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,770
Because if it's not going to happen on
our site,

76
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,680
and if we're not going to be able to
inform it and answer the questions,

77
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,200
it's going to happen somewhere else and
we will die.

78
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,270
And there'll be some new form.
I mean,

79
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,380
I think the most conventional view of
the future is everything is going to

80
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:05,410
become much more opinionated.
You're going to sort of,

81
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,350
um,
go to your own affinity group and your

82
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,580
own,
you know,

83
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,230
also,
I'm a single payer person,

84
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,530
so I'm only going to read people who
believe that's the way the world should

85
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:14,950
look.

86
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,710
And I'm going to find people who think
like me and that's where I'm going to

87
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,660
congregate.
And that is a legitimate point of view

88
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:24,700
in that very well may be what happens.
I'm hoping,

89
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,950
you know,
I'm not of the mind that that's what I

90
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,780
want to see happen.
I would like to see a richer environment

91
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,630
than that where people get connected to
views other than their own.

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,560
And I think wikipedia is an example of
that where they try to,

93
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,650
um,
create reliable,

94
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,880
though it is not always reliable,
but either is the mainstream media and

95
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,290
this idea that,
you know,

96
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,000
there's been this glory days of
newspapers when everything was perfect.

97
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,530
Are you kidding me?
I mean,

98
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,260
newspapers have always tried to sell
newspapers.

99
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,094
There's been a,
uh,

100
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,380
a sensational aspect of some,
there's been different,

101
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,400
you know,
different things done to create customer

102
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,230
interest and to keep loyalty.

103
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,480
So,
you know,

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,060
it's not like there was this great days
of newspapers and our democracy was so

105
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:16,061
perfect and now it's terrible.
I actually think it's better now because

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,520
more people can participate and there's
a greater ability to learn more quickly.

107
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,960
If you think of the tools available to a
journalist today versus the tools

108
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:31,040
available even 20 years ago.
It's so incredible.

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,130
I mean,
just using search engines to find

110
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,870
information,
um,

111
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,980
using,
um,

112
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,670
the fact that a journalist on the street
could have an iphone or a blackberry

113
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,390
where he or she's opening documents,
reading things.

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,253
I mean,
it's just,

115
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,430
it moves so much more quickly now that
requires a highly skilled journalists

116
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,390
and how are we going to pay for the
highly skilled journalists?

117
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,583
What are,
you know,

118
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,400
what kind of organization can train and
develop those people?

119
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,380
We don't have the answer to that
question.

120
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,450
Yeah.
