1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,870
You'll have to acknowledge that 
shakespeare was a little,

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:08,880
one of the primary inventors of the 
language we use today.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,670
He was a fountainhead of phrases and 
words and so on.

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,700
Then we now take for granted,
uh,

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,050
of course the other great shaper of our 
language languages,

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:16,680
the,
um,

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,680
the King James version of the Bible,
but it has a poultry vocabulary compared

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:28,491
with the Shakespeare's fountain of 
explosive found in other words.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,960
Uh,
so he did,

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,110
you know,
in terms of,

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,960
you know,
just giving us the means to communicate.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,540
He's,
he's a godfather.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,730
Um,
I think he is acknowledged as one of the

14
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:49,420
greatest dramatists ever.
The fact that the Russians claim him the

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,090
French,
the Germans or whatever,

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,780
that he's,
he's not English or American.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,160
He is this universal,
a playwright speaking,

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,210
invoicing,
extraordinary truths because he seems to

19
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,780
have the finger on the pulse of what 
makes people tick.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,530
Um,
he's fascinated by the human condition.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Um,
and yet you have to put it back.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,760
He was also in a writing plays for 
actors to perform.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,550
And so the formula is very,
um,

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,060
he's extraordinary because he's in the 
same play that he can,

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,463
you know,
for people who are maybe a little more 

26
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,970
educated,
have the essays,

27
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:36,804
have bacon in the park,
pocket's going to wash a shakespeare 

28
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:43,560
play.
They will get this wonderful existential

29
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,190
examination of,
you know,

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,610
what is man,
and what's the point,

31
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,690
where are we going?
And,

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,830
uh,
you know,

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,950
what his death,
uh,

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,700
all these wonderful issues in the same 
play that an ignorant,

35
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,563
uneducated,
a citizen can pay as penny stand in the 

36
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,194
rain and watch a play about armies and 
witches and poisonings and revenge and 

37
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,360
so on.
He absolutely gets his money's worth.

38
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,650
So he's has this wonderful ability to,
to encompass all these interests.

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,593
I think for the actor also,
he is one of the most generous of 

40
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,070
authors because,
um,

41
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,420
he doesn't want you to,
you don't have to,

42
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,590
do,
you know,

43
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,453
what the author intended because you're 
never quite sure with shakespeare what 

44
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:33,270
he intends,
he sort of supplies great situations,

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,710
extraordinary words,
but he wants your collaboration.

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,620
He wants your input.
Uh,

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,090
and uh,
it's,

48
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,930
it's,
it's,

49
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,410
it's always a,
uh,

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,660
teamwork.
You know,

51
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,494
there's,
there's not a definitive thing that you 

52
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:52,170
have to do that makes it a shakespeare 
in performance or Shakespeare and hamlet

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,180
and it's not what he wants.
And that's,

54
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,014
I think the reason why he's endured for 
so long and why every country sees him 

55
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:07,021
as the playwright and Whitefield go on 
being performed because he's,

56
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,500
he's,
he's,

57
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,334
yes,
he's language has changed over the 

58
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,040
years.
And uh,

59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,460
um,
the fact that he's all his,

60
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,080
uh,
you know,

61
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,090
the phrases that you use or they're not 
pretentious and highfaluting and poetic,

62
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,660
that the imagery is all from chairs and 
tables and glasses and whatever.

63
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,720
The things that can people relate to,
you know,

64
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:35,470
he doesn't talk in a self conscious 
poetic terms.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,220
Yeah.

66
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,490
Because he was being made an academic 
subject which he would have hated.

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,373
But once you get a,
if the class was made to perform a play 

68
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,240
to,
you know,

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,560
to,
to actually,

70
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,400
uh,
you know,

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,270
inhabit the roles and make them live.
Once you get behind it,

72
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,590
it's amazing.
And kids get Shakespeare.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,340
Um,
they,

74
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,630
uh,
he's very,

75
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:04,710
very user friendly.

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,130
I think if you're a young person

77
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,220
growing up a adolescent and you play 
Hamlet,

78
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,883
I'm there all sorts of things that you 
relate to and it's all about 

79
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:23,590
relationships with parents and the 
loyalties and friends,

80
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,800
school friends,
uh,

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,220
um,
what's it all about,

82
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,030
you know,
um,

83
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,320
love,
um,

84
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,110
in relationships with women.
It's,

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,850
well,
lots of things that relate to.

86
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:43,720
And the other thing about Shakespeare is
that the language is very,

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,130
as I said,
it's very easy to learn in a way because

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,473
again,
shakespeare was a genius and he 

89
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,140
constructs language in such a way that,
you know,

90
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,480
inhabits an actor's mind very 
comfortably.

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,793
And by the same token,
it's very difficult to unlearn because 

92
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm rattles around and uh,
and it sort of fertilizers the language.

93
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,900
You find yourself speaking,
you know,

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,210
using shakespeare and phrases all the 
time.

95
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,760
I come from a British group,
a

96
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,773
tradition,
and I think no British actor considers 

97
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,900
himself a true actor unless he has 
shakespeare under his belt.

98
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,890
Not just because it's a but because it's
a practical thing,

99
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,500
but he is the best.
Uh,

100
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:38,550
and he,
you know,

101
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:40,380
if you,
if you perform shakespeare,

102
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,243
you know,
you learn great things about breath 

103
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:45,900
control.
He's a,

104
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,950
and I think he is so often misunderstood
in this country,

105
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,043
uh,
where the method tradition is very 

106
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,740
strong.
You know,

107
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,160
this especially in movies,
fantastic for movies,

108
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,000
useless for Shakespeare because so many 
actors feel that they are to a,

109
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,050
instead of just playing the role,
you know,

110
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,010
the best acting,
I'm less than is there.

111
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,210
And Hamlet,
by the way,

112
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,323
at the mouth,
rather cheeky prince tells these 

113
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,820
professional actors how they should,
you know,

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,270
how,
how they should perform this play.

115
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,463
And it's really behind hamlet.
That's Shakespeare imploring actors for 

116
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,360
this new style.

117
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,560
But he's creating,
you know,

118
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,680
speak the speech.
I pray you as I pronounced it to you,

119
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,603
trippingly on the tongue,
but if you over it as many of your 

120
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:37,520
players do I have this leaf.
The town crier spoke my lines.

121
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,920
No,
did not solve the air too much with your

122
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:44,360
hands.
That's but use all gently be not to tame

123
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,194
neither,
but let your own discretion be your 

124
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,750
tutors,
sued the reaction to the word,

125
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,670
the word to the action with this special
observance,

126
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,260
that step,
not the modesty of nature for anything.

127
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:57,710
So,
uh,

128
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,543
don is from the purpose of playing who's
an both of the fest and now was and is 

129
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,523
to hold as to where the mirror up to 
nature to show veteran feature on her 

130
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:13,160
own image and the very age and body of 
the time,

131
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,640
his form and pressure.
It goes on a bit.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,210
Nothing's changed.
What else do you need?

133
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,063
No,

134
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,680
it's a question.
Are we better off if we know exactly who

135
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:30,514
shakespeare was?
Are we to accept this stratfordian 

136
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:36,190
candidate who for my money is a little 
unlikely?

137
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,500
There's a man who could barely write his
name,

138
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,240
who was,
whose wife was illiterate,

139
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:43,780
who own notebooks and nothing was spoken
about him in his lifetime.

140
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,590
It's a,
it seems that William Shrugs,

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,950
pair of,
uh,

142
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,700
of water is not the brilliant genius,
the William Shake Hyphen Spear Elizabeth

143
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,630
and giveaway for a pseudonym,
um,

144
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,470
who wrote these plays and,
um,

145
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,193
I'm my own feeling as a candidate.
The earl of Oxford airport to veer is 

146
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,990
highly plausible,
but the smoking gun that will link him,

147
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,963
you know,
whereas a lot of evidence but are way 

148
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,390
better off knowing who he is.
I'll be just,

149
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,900
you know,
well off just having the,

150
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:29,980
um,
you know,

151
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,730
what he wrote to go.
