1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,960
If I were a smart musician,
I would have done what the other smart

2
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,810
musicians did,
which is only licensed your music in

3
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,210
places where they don't speak English.
That's,

4
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,940
I mean all the credible musicians,
I don't want to name names,

5
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,480
but they don't license their music in
the UK or the states.

6
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,520
They license it.
And Portugal are they licensed it and

7
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:29,980
South Korea or Japan and that way the
tastemakers,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,530
you know,
the music journalists never hear about

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,670
it.
But it's,

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,120
it's a strange phenomenon because,
I mean,

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,670
I have been criticized for licensing my
music to commercials,

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,610
but it's odd for a few reasons.
One,

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,860
that most of the journalists who've
criticized me write for publications

14
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,590
that are wholly funded by ad revenue.
You know,

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,010
so there'll be an article criticizing me
for liking my music to commercials and

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,540
on the next page,
and an ad for Ford or budweiser or what

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,260
have you.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,260
And the same journalists who are people
who criticize me for licensing my music.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,410
Actually,
you know,

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,090
by the products that are being
advertised.

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,290
And I don't know,
I,

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,680
maybe it's the old punk rocker in me.
I always thought it was cooler to take

23
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,500
money from a big corporation and to give
money to a big corporation.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,700
So I have regrets that I did too much
licensing.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,220
Um,
and I should have as I had been smart

26
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,130
and done what everyone else does is only
licensed it to South Korea and Japan.

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,530
When play came out,
uh,

28
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,470
at first it didn't have any success.
You know,

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,840
the reviews weren't very good.
It didn't sell very well,

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,650
and then it sort of picked up momentum
and became a successful record.

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,540
So at first the only,
the only way I had to get people to make

32
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,580
people aware of the music was by
licensing it to movies,

33
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,670
TV shows,
advertisement.

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,940
So we did a lot of it.
Uh,

35
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,870
in hindsight,
I think I did too much of it.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,690
There's another ironic aspect of it,
which is that at the time people in the

37
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,210
music business be,
they're musicians or record executives,

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,660
heap scorn on me for doing this.
And that was all the same record

39
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,110
executives are all working at licensing
companies or they're working at record

40
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,910
labels where they're desperate to
license anything.

41
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,750
And there's a lot of the musicians who
also criticized me are now bending over

42
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:14,310
backwards and frustrating prostrating
themselves to try and get their music

43
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:18,630
licensed.
So I think that unfortunately,

44
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,100
I don't mean this in a positive way.
I was sort of the avant garde of

45
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,250
licensing.
You know,

46
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,630
I was like the shock troop of licensing.
So as a result I got killed first,

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,600
you know,
so now everyone does it and no one's

48
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,620
really criticized for it.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,170
Um,
but yes,

50
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,760
in hindsight,
I definitely did way too much of it.

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,520
But the only reason I got involved in
the music business,

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,980
it was because I love music and I want
to make music.

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,620
And selfishly I'd like people to hear
the music that I make.

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,840
Um,
I'm not too concerned with the

55
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,990
commercial ramifications of producing
and producing music and putting it out

56
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,520
into the world.
If people want to buy my music,

57
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,620
fine.
If they don't want to,

58
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,820
that's fine with me too.
Uh,

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,400
again,
my,

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,290
my only interest in the commercial side
of the music business is to try and get

61
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,320
people to hear the music that I've made.
You know,

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,940
so I don't,
I don't look at the music business and

63
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,800
think how can I make a lot of money from
it?

64
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,650
I look at it and I think,
how can I strategically try and get

65
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:22,110
people to hear the music that I've made?
And so when I look at that,

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,690
the fact that the record companies are
falling apart and revenue streams are

67
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,030
dying,
drying up and royalties or you know,

68
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,300
a 10th what they used to be for a lot of
people,

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,760
um,
it doesn't concern me.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,220
Um,
some from sort of like a fiduciary

71
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,610
perspective,
it only concerns me from a musician's

72
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,080
perspective where I just hope that in
the future I'm able to make music that

73
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,160
people will be willing to listen.
