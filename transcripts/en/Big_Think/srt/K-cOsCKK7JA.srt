1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,130
Well,
certainly I think religious forces have

2
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,670
had a huge impact and continue to,
whether it's,

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,700
um,
whether it's a particular religion or a

4
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,740
profit or whatever.
Um,

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,770
certainly we wouldn't,
we wouldn't be here in the United States

6
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,200
if,
um,

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,670
our forefathers hadn't been concerned
about religious persecution in Europe at

8
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,510
the time.
They,

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,140
uh,
the pilgrims came over to Plymouth rock.

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,830
Um,
we wouldn't see the same divisions if we

11
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,600
hadn't had the crusades.
I mean,

12
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,910
that's,
that's been something that has

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,120
influenced us through the centuries,
I believe it is to make things better,

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,620
to try and make the world a better place
for the people who live here.
