1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,310
You know,
when I started doing this about 10 years

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:17,140
ago in London and when I first started
this job,

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,860
I used to literally make lists of people
on Wall Street that I wanted to try to

4
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:24,560
meet,
um,

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,420
every given month.
So I would sit and make a list of 30

6
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:32,830
people and I would cold call literally
and um,

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,530
introduce myself as a reporter who
planned to be on the beat for a very

8
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:43,480
long time and thought it was important
that we get to know each other in some

9
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:44,314
way.
And

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,120
I think hopefully over the years people
have

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,070
taken those calls and occasionally those
meetings and a trust level has

12
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,300
developed.
And I think that's probably true of any

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,633
a reporter.

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,730
It's really about a
hard work shoe,

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,110
leather reporting,
getting on the telephone,

16
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,550
running around to,
in my case is to meetings or events to

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,610
see different people and a whispering in
their ear and hopefully they're gonna

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,560
whisper back,
uh,

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,430
and,
and tell you the information,

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,720
you know,
as a child,

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,900
I always enjoyed,
uh,

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,900
my parents used to have these little
cocktail parties and I always loved

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,840
trying to get the adults to tell me
things they weren't supposed to say.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,570
And in many ways that's what my job is
today.

25
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,050
It's getting people to tell me things
that they probably are otherwise not

26
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,380
supposed to say.
And I think you do that by developing

27
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:47,760
some semblance of trust that you're,
that you're going to be fair and,

28
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:48,480
and,
and,

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
and that,
that you get it.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,560
I think that's part of it.
I've tried to study the industry.

31
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:56,160
I've spent enormous amounts of time.
I can unfortunately do a model,

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,430
a dcf model with the best of them.
I wouldn't say I enjoy it,

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:03,570
but,
and I also think that when you studied

34
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,410
it up,
when you,

35
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,800
when you come to the table with the
right questions,

36
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,740
when it's clear to the other side of
the,

37
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:14,160
to the interviewee,
that you know what you're talking about,

38
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,420
you can get a lot more.

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,510
The hardest part for financial
journalists going forward is actually

40
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:28,110
going to be to get a straight take.
Um,

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,670
it's very hard to truly get close to the
action anymore.

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,600
I think there was a sense in the
eighties and maybe even part of the

43
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:41,601
nineties and earlier when you could
really get the CEO on the phone any day

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,880
you could,
you could really get inside the story.

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,140
But today most of these companies are
pretty lawyered up.

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
They have a PR apparatus.
It's very hard in real time to actually

47
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:05,971
get a story that hasn't come prespen.
And while the government is requiring

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,390
more and more disclosures as we've seen,
some of these disclosures are worthless.

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,390
And so it makes it,
it makes,

50
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,870
it makes it an enormous challenge to be
able to,

51
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,830
to really be able to spot the problems.
Um,

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,680
when,
when I'm aware that they're out to lunch

53
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,320
and my goal is usually to tell you that
they're out to lunch,

54
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm like,
I can't promise I've,

55
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,620
I've gotten it right every time.
That's a terrific question because

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,140
unfortunately in the world of sort of
Wall Street prognosticators,

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,920
they only happened to old to be right
once or twice.

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,150
So right now,
Nouriel Roubini for example,

59
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,420
who called the crisis,
seems to be the guy that you'd want to

60
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,690
hear from,
or merit of Whitney who told you that

61
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:08,710
Citi group was in trouble,
would be somebody you'd want to spend

62
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:11,650
time to listen to you when in perhaps
quote in an article

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,520
what other people would suggest to you
that they were making these arguments

64
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,480
for six or seven or eight years.
And had you been quoting them then you,

65
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,770
most people would have told you they
were absolutely wildly wrong.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,400
So it's actually a complicated issue
because some of these people will look

67
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:35,910
right and be right for the moment and
then won't be right for a very long

68
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,744
time.
Again,

69
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,350
financial television,
plato,

70
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,360
remarkably large role as the medium with
which people were receiving their

71
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,680
information during this crisis.
This was probably the first televised

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,220
financial crisis that existed and some
people have blamed tv for the crisis or

73
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:07,391
for speeding up the crisis
and there might be some truth to that in

74
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,770
that as journalists who are trying to
reflect what's happening in the market,

75
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,570
it gets reflected back and and this sort
of mirror gets mirrored back and forth

76
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:21,770
and back and forth,
and there's a personalization to a TV as

77
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,890
a medium is so different than reading a
headline that's saying there's a

78
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,290
problem,
but when you're sitting in your office,

79
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:31,110
especially when it's about yourself or
about a firm that you're trading within

80
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:35,300
your hearing and seeing another
individual tell you these folks are in

81
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,134
trouble.

82
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,890
It really can exacerbate the situation.
That's not to say that I think all of

83
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,680
these people were doing reporting
irresponsibly.

84
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,990
There were some reports that were wrong
here and there,

85
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,530
but for the most part I must say even
having finished this book,

86
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:56,531
I watched a lot of tv tapes during this
period and most of the stuff actually

87
00:05:56,661 --> 00:06:00,350
stood up quite well,
much better than I suspect many people

88
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,340
would want to acknowledge.
