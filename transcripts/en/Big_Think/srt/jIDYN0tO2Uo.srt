1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,660
I think Google glass could be an
incredible technology.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,620
Um,
one of my Grad students,

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:12,810
it's working at the lab is working on a,
uh,

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,940
simultaneous subtitle,
translation application for movies.

5
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:23,221
So you could go into a movie and be a
Spanish speaking person and you could go

6
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:28,621
into an English language movie and it
would show you the subtitles on the

7
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:31,270
Google glass while you're watching the
movie.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,680
That to me would be very cool.
And if we could do it in seven or eight

9
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:39,820
languages,
that would be a fabulous application

10
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,210
for,
uh,

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,870
and,
and maybe even for people who are hard

12
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:47,230
of hearing you could,
you could do that and it has a little,

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,360
you know,
bone conductor in the back of the

14
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:51,670
things.
So you could feel the shake of the

15
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:56,671
buildings in an action movie,
but also see the English subtitles,

16
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,580
so to speak.
But that being said,

17
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:05,581
I also think that if I was at a really
interesting political dinner party,

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,240
say,
and someone had google glass on,

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,980
would I be as honest and open and you
know,

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,030
just completely loose,
especially after a bottle of wine as,

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,060
as I would if they didn't have google
glass on.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,370
I'm not sure I would,
you know,

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,020
cause I wouldn't be sure we'll,
are they recording me or am I going to

24
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,340
get home?
I going to regret what I'm saying.

25
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,530
You know?
So that's,

26
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,820
that's an interesting question.
