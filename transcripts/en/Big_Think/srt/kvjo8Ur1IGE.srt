1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,290
Well Bank was created in 1944 before the
world war two Sargo was over.

2
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,280
It was created together with the
Monetary Fund,

3
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:22,090
International Monetary Fund and what it
was going to be late to the WTO,

4
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:25,630
the World Trade Organization in the case
of the bank.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,690
Uh,
its main purpose was to borrow money on

6
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:33,691
the markets in those days,
Europe more than the u s and to lend

7
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:37,780
this money for the reconstruction of
Europe,

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,640
of Japan and so forth.
So it was very bold design for the

9
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,820
times.
And it did that in the 50s.

10
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,310
Mostly it was in during construction
business.

11
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:53,311
It finance the reconstruction for
instance of Toyota in the in Japan or

12
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:57,790
the financing for the reconstruction of
the French railway system came from

13
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:02,020
there.
Then in the 60s that preconstruction job

14
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,350
was over.
It went into developing country

15
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,840
business,
uh,

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,930
lending for hospitals,
for highways or ports for agriculture in

17
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,950
the developing world,
starting mostly in Latin America and

18
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,210
then going worldwide.

19
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,230
And it really became the World Bank that
is known today under Mcnamara.

20
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:31,111
And Mcnamara came from the u s
government to become a very famous

21
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:36,040
president of the World Bank in the 70s.
He made it grow to a much bigger place

22
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,530
than it was originally.
Originally.

23
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:43,531
Ted Let less than a thousand people in
Washington and today it has 12,000

24
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:48,931
people roughly.
And he got the World Bank into social

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,310
areas,
into education,

26
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,290
into hell's,
into nutrition,

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,940
into what was called basic needs,
integrated rural development and so

28
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:02,140
forth.
And so it became the largest and most,

29
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:07,060
uh,
sort of broadest development institution

30
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:10,330
in the world.
And that it is still today,

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,420
even though it's a very much change.
Well,

32
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,520
there's still a lot of that work to be
done.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,410
It still operates by borrowing money in
the markets by issuing bonds,

34
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,530
using the money for very long term
loans,

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,160
which all have to do with some
development purpose.

36
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,580
And then when the loans get three
reimbursed by the clients,

37
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,980
uh,
we repaid to bondholders.

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,640
That's the,
the way the World Bank works for the

39
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,100
very poor countries.
It has a special Katie,

40
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:43,000
which is not based on borrowing money.
It's based on donated money.

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,770
It's called the International
Development Association window or Idi

42
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,650
Window.
And that leads to very long term loans

43
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,710
without an interest rate,
uh,

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,040
or on grand terms for very poor
countries under roughly a thousand

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,040
dollars per person.
So it's an institution that's a sort of

46
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,980
bank in a way.
There is a sort of financial function,

47
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,730
financing function,
but it's also full of people who have a

48
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,170
lot of knowledge of what works and
doesn't work in education and road

49
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:18,870
surfacing and building latrines in a
textbook,

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,340
publications for schools,
uh,

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,680
and cataract operations,
you name it.

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,180
So it's not just a money bank,
it's a knowledge bank at the same time.

53
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,080
And lately it has become very active
also in a big global issues like global

54
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,780
warming,
uh,

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,700
the ozone depletion,
uh,

56
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,730
the pollution of the seas and so forth.
So it is still mainly in the poverty

57
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,800
reduction business and the development
business,

58
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:52,720
but it's beginning to become a presence
in the global issues business as well.
