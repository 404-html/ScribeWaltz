1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,540
Right when I was a kid in grade school,
I would write really bizarre.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,210
I was always interested in,
in,

3
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:18,800
um,
murder mysteries and murder and law and,

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,290
um,
and sort of the darker impulses of

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,340
people.
Um,

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,300
so I would write stories about um,
murderous matrons and,

7
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:27,134
and,
um,

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,600
you know,
serial killers who,

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,810
you know,
were re grandmothers and,

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,713
and,
um,

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,810
would send these stories off to ellery
queen and,

12
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:36,320
and,
um,

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,890
Alfred Hitchcock and,
you know,

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,730
kept getting rejections.
Of course I was like 15 and 14,

15
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:42,590
so I,
I really didn't expect anything,

16
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,880
but I kept doing it just for fun.
Um,

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,410
and then I sort of gave it up and I
figured,

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,040
you know,
nobody can really grow up and become a

19
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,930
writer.
I didn't think that was something people

20
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:53,330
did for a living.
It was sort of a fancy bowl thing.

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,060
Um,
and I had planned that go to law school.

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,180
Um,
that's mostly because I thought that

23
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:00,960
would be the easiest thing to do.
And I,

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,940
I like to argue with people and I like
politics and um,

25
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,560
but while I was in,
in college,

26
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:09,350
I got an internship at a Philadelphia
magazine and,

27
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,184
and,
um,

28
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,330
one of the things I had to do besides
picking up people's laundry and opera

29
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,930
tickets was a,
in transcribing the interviews,

30
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,900
it was way before anybody had machines
that did that for you.

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,160
So,
um,

32
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,750
there are a couple journalists who
would,

33
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,840
who would make me transcribe the
interviews and they would say things

34
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:27,674
like,
you know,

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,680
note how I ask this question.
No,

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,680
the way I sort of used in and this word
and the way they answered this,

37
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,650
mark that down.
And it was a very calculated system of

38
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:38,270
questioning that,
that intrigued me.

39
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:38,890
And,
uh,

40
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,370
that's when I started wanting to be in
general.
