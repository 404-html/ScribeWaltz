Well,
I think the most successful media brands

2
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:19,281
understood some time ago that the
mission is really to deliver content

3
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,831
across all the platforms that consumers
are embracing and indeed to sell that

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,160
audience to advertisers.
So for example,

5
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,910
for playboy enterprises,
we were the first national magazine to

6
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:37,770
go up on the web back in 1994.
We've been delivering content via mobile

7
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,430
for over five years,
and our mantra is to kind of grow our

8
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,800
audience and grow our ad sales.
