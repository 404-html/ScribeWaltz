1
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,440
Growing,
so I think you will see also India,

2
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,330
because it's a young country,
you know,

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,700
more than 50 percent of the population
is below the age of uh,

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,450
25.
Uh,

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,110
so I think you will see a more youthful
culture,

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,090
a more exuberant in many ways,
a more matter of fact,

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,380
uh,
and this culture is contributing already

8
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,940
and will contribute even more to the
growth of housing.

9
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,250
For example,
young people buying homes.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,460
I think we'll have a lot more cars on
the roads,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a certainly a young population that is
very gripped by technology changes and

12
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,841
very open to everything that the digital
age or offers.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,680
So I think we're going to see an India
in which certainly divides will still be

14
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:13,370
there.
You will see young urban Indians,

15
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,220
very tech savvy,
very connected to the urban cultures.

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,080
You will still have people living in our
villages in very traditional ways as

17
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,930
they do today.
And I think that they will continue at

18
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,940
least for the next 10,
15,

19
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,000
20 years.
And,

20
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:30,721
uh,
so we,

21
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,560
uh,
will be,

22
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:36,150
I think at a different level,
but as we joke in India about how we

23
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,590
live in all the ages,

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,410
the Samsung.
