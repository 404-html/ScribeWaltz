1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,840
My favorite really is a nonprofit.
I had a young woman come to me,

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,800
I guess it's three years ago,
and she came in my office and sat down

3
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:14,810
and take my entrepreneurship courses and
she said,

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,180
you know,
in New York City public schools,

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,870
there are 300 schools that are
elementary that do not have playgrounds

6
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,220
for children.
I'm going to fix that.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,590
And they just sat there and kind of
nodded and said,

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,760
that's interesting how you're going to
do that.

9
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:26,391
And she said,
I don't know,

10
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:30,210
but I'm going to do it.
Did you spent a year studying it,

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,290
going around and taking pictures,
building a case that this was something

12
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,520
that really children should have.
Three years later,

13
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,830
that young lady has raised over $10
million.

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,920
She's already completed 20 playgrounds
in New York City,

15
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,920
has 20 some more in the pipeline under
construction.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,920
So I look at somebody like that and she
has the skill to new or anything she

17
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,770
wants,
but I just am overwhelmed with the fact

18
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:54,350
that she could go out there and do it
just with that spirit.

19
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,570
And I celebrate her every time I see
her.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,240
Uh,
we also have a company that we launched

21
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,950
called Recycle Bank,
which is a,

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,830
a company that's done just phenomenally
well.

23
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:07,510
And it came out of our program and I
worked very closely with that student,

24
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:10,670
a Ron Gonan,
and it's built into something very

25
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,451
special.
You know,

26
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:13,190
there were awarding people for
recycling,

27
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:16,790
and it's a rewards program and they're
having a dramatic effect in the cities

28
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,320
that they're entering.
And I see a lot of growth.

29
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,290
We just have endless numbers of these
wonderful young people.

30
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:26,291
And I get up every day just a Sullivan
[inaudible].
