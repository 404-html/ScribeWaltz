00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,570
I think there is clearly a room at this
point for a third party because the

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,660
Democrats,
since they've taken control of Congress,

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,750
have done very little to build public
confidence.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,780
The public approval ratings of Congress
are as low now as they were before the

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,850
2006 election.
The Republicans are carrying the burden

6
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,150
of the Bush administration.
I think it's wide open for an

7
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,190
independent or third party candidates.
