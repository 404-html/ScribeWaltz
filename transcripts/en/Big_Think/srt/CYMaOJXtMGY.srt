1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,750
Well,
we're to human rights come from,

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,940
you know,
here you can say where do they write so

3
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,660
the comatose come from or the babies
come from.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,900
It's the fact that within us we have a
sense of moral purpose and we know

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,980
innately most of us,
whether something seems right or seems

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,981
wrong and we have the rules that we live
our lives by which they do not do such

7
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:37,311
and such to some individual,
it may hurt to not be disrespectful and

8
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:42,531
I think that that has to extend beyond
those we relate to most because the true

9
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,750
test of compassion is if you can be
decent to those,

10
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,220
you relate to least.
So I believe it comes from within us

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,460
from where we get kindness generally and
where we're able to be altruistic to

12
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,700
others.
That's where it.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,910
We should extend that.

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,990
Yeah.
