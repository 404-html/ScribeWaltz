1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,370
Well,
it's,

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,160
it is interesting that it never started 
as a,

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,400
a pure business plan,
a 20 or 30 page business plan.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,640
It really came about through 
happenstance when I was taking a trip to

5
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:22,860
go to whistler ski week,
uh,

6
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:23,694
and I had booked the ticket,
the air flight on orbits and orbits did 

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,370
not send me any information on the 
destination.

8
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,680
And I'm a,
I'm very much a travel enthusiast.

9
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:35,160
I've traveled all my life having lived 
or worked overseas,

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,770
uh,
on,

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,603
on many different occasions.
And I thought that it was strange that 

12
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:42,230
there was no information provided by the
online travel agency.

13
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,064
So I actually decided to get into this 
business initially by publishing a 

14
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,581
series of online travel guides.
And we started out by partnering with an

15
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:55,640
airline America,
West Airlines with the thought of,

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,783
uh,
adding on additional partnerships over 

17
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:01,140
time.
Eventually by stepping in a,

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,033
with the online guides that led to my 
exploring other areas of opportunity in 

19
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,774
the travel industry,
particularly with travel deals 

20
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:10,284
publishing,
which really is our core business these 

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,871
days.
Uh,

22
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,704
so we migrated from being a publisher of
pure online travel guides to being one 

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,570
of being a rather large publisher of 
travel deals today.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,760
Uh,
Shermans travel.com

25
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:29,270
is a publisher of travel deals and 
destination advice.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,400
Uh,
we're very different from the Ota,

27
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:34,310
the online travel agencies like Expedia,
priceline,

28
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,810
and travelocity,
and Orbitz,

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,110
in fact,
many of those are our clients of ours,

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,040
uh,
but we are a pure publisher,

31
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:41,874
so we're advertising supported.
We published thousands of deals and 

32
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:49,991
they're handpicked by our editors every 
day and published on the website as well

33
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:50,864
as through our email products.
We have are a Sherman's top 25 travel 

34
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,850
deals newsletter that comes out every 
Wednesday,

35
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,943
uh,
that is received by over 4 million 

36
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,960
subscribers.
Uh,

37
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,600
the website has a host of other 
resources,

38
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:05,450
including over 300 travel guides,
videos,

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,690
one-on-ones,
slide shows,

40
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,100
a lot of great resources there.
Hotel reviews,

41
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,240
of course,
uh,

42
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,140
and a travel search tool.
Uh,

43
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,023
we also publish a magazine which is more
upscale while the website is more mass 

44
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:21,800
market reaching the broad audience of 
leisure travelers.

45
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,813
Uh,
the magazine's skews more upscale and 

46
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:27,290
it's positioned around what we call 
smart luxury.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,800
So it's a combination of luxury but 
still a good value.

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,280
And our brand positioning overall is 
about value,

49
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,940
whether it's on the,
uh,

50
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,883
on the lower end,
what we call a smart bargain or the 

51
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:41,810
higher end in terms of a smart luxury.
The magazine,

52
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,610
uh,
does cover some deals.

53
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,160
We have a section there called the Lux 
list,

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,120
which is the,
uh,

55
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:47,954
the best values of the season that are 
the best and foreign five star 

56
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,540
vacations,
uh,

57
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,390
but the magazine is not necessarily 
always looking for a deal per se.

58
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,180
The magazine will cover destinations and
talk about,

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,060
uh,
uh,

60
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,690
places to stay that are upscale but 
still work but are worth the money.

61
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,563
Uh,
so we may talk about an $800 a night 

62
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,450
resort in St Barts,
but at the same time we'll highlight one

63
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,540
that's three or $400.
That's less expensive.

64
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,374
It's still luxury,
but it's going to be a little more 

65
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,950
affordable for what we view as a 
significant portion of the population.

66
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,400
That is those,
uh,

67
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,253
that we call the mass affluent.
Not necessarily the ultra rich that are 

68
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,160
willing to pay any price,
which may be point,

69
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,380
oh,
one percent of the population,

70
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,453
but rather a larger segment that want a 
more affordable but still a luxurious 

71
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
experience.

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,273
Well,
certainly anyone that is in the deals 

73
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,150
business is in a good position these 
days,

74
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,620
given the recession that we're in.
And that is true both on the high end in

75
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,454
terms of our luxury value positioning 
with the magazine as well as for the 

76
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,490
website and our email products that,
that,

77
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,463
uh,
provide great overall deals and 

78
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,570
bargains.
Uh,

79
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:03,930
so we do find that a lot of suppliers 
are price cutting.

80
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,280
There's no,
no doubt about that.

81
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,114
Hotels need to do that to fill up their 
rooms and to decrease their vacancy 

82
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,960
rates.
The same with the airlines.

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,053
Uh,
so it's a great time as a traveler to 

84
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:16,704
find amazing deals out there.
Unfortunately for us as a business 

85
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:20,620
though,
uh,

86
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,533
the suppliers and the agencies because 
they're making less money means they 

87
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:28,860
have less money to spend on advertising.
So the ad budgets,

88
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:29,694
uh,
have been,

89
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,740
uh,
certainly very tight this year,

90
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,563
uh,
in terms of hotspot vacations certainly 

91
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,120
for American travelers.

92
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,850
Uh,
the Caribbean is doing incredibly well.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,660
I think that may be because people have 
been a little bit scared off of Mexico,

94
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,570
uh,
given uh,

95
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,980
the flu and then crime and some other 
issues there.

96
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,320
So I know a number of travelers have 
changed.

97
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,480
Plans have shifted perhaps to the 
Caribbean.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,790
Um,
in terms of other,

99
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,703
a hotspot,
certainly Americans are going to any 

100
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,690
value destinations,
a London for example,

101
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:04,524
visit Britain's been doing an amazing 
job in promoting London as a 

102
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,764
destination.
It's always been relatively low cost to 

103
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:10,974
get to in terms of the airfare,
but now the hotels are quite affordable 

104
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:14,784
as well.
There's been a lot of price competition 

105
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:16,960
there.
Uh,

106
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,780
there are also great values in terms of 
sort of second tier destinations,

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,310
places like a Buddha,
budapest,

108
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,580
for example,
or even Luganda,

109
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,423
some other destinations in central and 
eastern Europe that are very affordable 

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,430
for travelers these days.
