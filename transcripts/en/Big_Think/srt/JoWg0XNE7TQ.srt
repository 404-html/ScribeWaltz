1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the late 1920,
a young man outside of Tampa in Florida

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,840
picked up an ax and hacked his family to
death.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,870
His name is Victor Lacarta.
At that point,

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,890
cannabis was not illegal in the United
States and a man called Harry anslinger.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,350
I'd taken over the Department of Alcohol
Prohibition,

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,690
Justice,
Alcohol prohibition was ending,

7
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,830
so you inherited this huge government
department that's just lost the war and

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,940
alcohol.
It's riddled with corruption and he

9
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,750
wants to keep it going.
He had previously said that cannabis was

10
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,030
not dangerous,
shouldn't worry about it.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,120
He's suddenly decided that cannabis was
the most evil.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,080
Literally,
this is his words,

13
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,670
the most evil drug in the world.
He said,

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,040
I'm much worse than heroin.
He said,

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,070
he said,
if if Frankenstein's monster mutt

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
cannabis on the staircase that would
drop dead or fried,

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,430
and he latched onto the case of Victor
Lacarta with the help of the kind of Fox

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,590
News of his day,
which was called the hearst newspapers.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,890
He announced that Victor Lacarta had
smoked cannabis.

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,280
That's why he'd hacked his family to
death with an ax,

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,590
and this is what will happen if we allow
cannabis to spread and we need to ban

22
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,200
and prohibit cannabis.
It was in the wake of that case that

23
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,150
cannabis is band.
Years later,

24
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,180
somebody goes back,
a researcher where many years later,

25
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,550
decades later,
a researcher went back and looked at

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,700
Victor Lacarta his files.
There's no evidence even smoke cannabis.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,520
His family had been told he needs to be
institutionalized the year before

28
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:33,180
because it was severely mentally ill,
but they decided to keep him at home.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,470
The origins of the war on drugs,
which I wrote about in my book,

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,540
chasing the scream.
The first and last days of the war on

31
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,541
drugs overwhelmingly looked like that.
If you'd asked me when I started doing

32
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,980
the research for chasing screen,
why was cannabis band?

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,910
I would have guessed they would have
given the reasons then,

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,890
but if you stop someone on the street
now,

35
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:53,280
they would give.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,930
You know,
we don't want kids to use drugs.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,890
We don't want people to become addicted.
What's fascinating is that stuff just

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,840
never,
virtually never came up when they were

39
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:01,770
banning cannabis,
right?

40
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:05,310
Or indeed the other drugs.
It was overwhelmingly a kind of racial

41
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:10,311
panic and absurd hysteria is about,
about what was going to happen.

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,470
Now,
the one thing you can say in defense of

43
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,660
the war on drugs in the world,
cannabis in particular,

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,940
is we've given it a fair shot,
right?

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,080
The United States has spent a trillion
dollars a,

46
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,440
it's imprisoned,
um,

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,690
more people than any other country in
human history,

48
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:29,691
including Stalin's Russia and China and
it's destroyed whole countries like

49
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:33,630
Columbia at the end of all that,
we can't even keep drugs out of our

50
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,930
prisons where we pay someone to walk
around the perimeter the whole time,

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,720
which gives you some idea of how well
we're ever going to keep that out of the

52
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,760
country with two,
3000 mile borders.

53
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,380
There is an alternative for how we can
think about cannabis.

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,590
There are places that have legalized
cannabis and we can see the results.

55
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,360
So I spent a lot of time in Colorado and
Washington state actually spent time in

56
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,220
places that have legalized other drugs.
Heroin,

57
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,320
for example.
It's been legalized in Switzerland with

58
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:01,600
extraordinary results.
There have been zero overdose deaths on

59
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,990
legal heroin in Switzerland in the more
than 13 years since they,

60
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,720
since they legalized.
But with cannabis specifically,

61
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,460
again,
we can see the results.

62
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,740
When you banned cannabis,
several things happen.

63
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,240
The first thing that happens is it you
will have noticed it does not disappear.

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,630
It's transferred from licensed legal
businesses to armed criminal gangsters.

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,000
Those armed criminal gangsters have to
operate differently to a licensed

66
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,190
business.
So you know,

67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,670
you will have noticed the head of
Budweiser does not go and shoot the head

68
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,020
of Heineken in the face,
right?

69
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,550
Your local liquor store does not send
people to go and stab people in the

70
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,840
local bar.
Right,

71
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,000
exactly.
That happened at the alcohol

72
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,834
prohibition,
right?

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,590
I mean exactly that and it ended the day
alcohol prohibition ended.

74
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,960
Why?
Because when you band drugs,

75
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,750
they have to operate in an illegal
market where there's no,

76
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,040
and I learned this from lots of drug
dealers.

77
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,990
I spent time with the chasing the
scream,

78
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,150
not just for fun,
and there was some funding as well.

79
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,233
Um,
the,

80
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,830
the illegal market can only operate
through violence,

81
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,080
right?
You have no recourse to the Lord.

82
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,750
You're,
if,

83
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,760
if,
if I go out of here now and I tried to

84
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,430
steal a bottle of vodka,
you know,

85
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,170
the liquor store,
we'll call the cops.

86
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:11,710
The cops will come and take me away.
So there's no need for that liquor store

87
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,530
to be violent,
to be intimidating if I go out of here

88
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:16,660
now and try to steal a bag of weed from
the people who sell it,

89
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,230
not so far away,
they can't call the cops.

90
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,760
The cops would come and arrest them.
They have to fight me now.

91
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,770
You don't want to be having a fight
everyday if you're a dealer.

92
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,590
So you got to establish a reputation for
being so frightening that people

93
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,420
wouldn't be so stupid as to come and
fight yet.

94
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,090
Right?
So this is the ratchet effect you get

95
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,730
with prohibition.
You create a market that can only be

96
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,510
regulated by violence and where there is
actually a premium on being the most

97
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,320
violent person and the most intimidating
person when you have to be violent,

98
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:45,130
intimidating to protect your market.
Now when you legalize that goes away

99
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,300
immediately.
That ended.

100
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,170
Whereas Al Capone,
it does anyone even know the head of

101
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,310
Smirnoff's name,
right?

102
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,200
Everyone watching this knows Al Capone's
name.

103
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,480
I bet nobody watching this knows the
head of smirnoff's name.

104
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,040
What changed?
It's not the drug,

105
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,640
it's the fact that it went from being
illegal and therefore controlled by

106
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:04,060
gangsters to legal and being controlled
by legal and licensed businesses.

107
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,640
The second thing that happens,
which is a slightly more wonky point but

108
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,950
I think is really interesting and
important,

109
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,650
is that milder forms of the drug
disappeared.

110
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,780
So you often get.
People say,

111
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,510
well,
we can't legalize cannabis because the

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,520
cannabis people use today isn't the
cannabis people used it in the 19

113
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,091
sixties,
right?

114
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,600
It's much stronger.
It's things like skunk [inaudible]

115
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,080
skunk.
That's true,

116
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,260
and it's entirely the product about
cannabis prohibition.

117
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,980
You want to understand why I got into
dancing just before alcohol was banned

118
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:34,270
in the United States,
most popular drinks by far were beer and

119
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,640
wine.
After alcohol is legalized.

120
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:39,130
Again,
most popular drinks by far were beer and

121
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,980
wine.
Is there a main today and when alcohol

122
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,600
was banned,
you couldn't get hold of barrel wine

123
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,910
anywhere.
Most popular drinks where whiskey and

124
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,631
Moonshine,
you think,

125
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,201
well,
why is that?

126
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,550
Why we're banning a drug change?

127
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,640
The form of the drug is kind of rather
prosaic reason,

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,840
and actually we had to smuggle enough.
You know,

129
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,190
alcohol for your local bar from the
Mexican border or the Canadian border,

130
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:05,150
right?
If we fill our wagon with a beer,

131
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:09,020
we'll get drink for 100 people.
If we fill our wagon with whiskey,

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,320
will get drink for thousands of people.
When you ban drugs,

133
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,950
there's suddenly a premium on getting
the biggest possible kick into the

134
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,990
smallest possible space because it's got
to be smuggled,

135
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,060
right?
It's got to be transported in secret.

136
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,790
This happens with all drugs.
This is what I kind of.

137
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,410
It's become.
It's become much more potent,

138
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,840
most popular form of consuming cocaine
prior to it being banned was intake coca

139
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,480
tea,
and you may remember a drink called Coca

140
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,820
Cola that really to contain exactly what
it sounds like,

141
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,690
they don't exist anymore.
Went to ever hear about Coker Tea,

142
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:37,990
right?

143
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,410
Coca Cola exists,
but it's not what it was.

144
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,590
Obviously,
the most popular way of consuming opiods

145
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,620
by far was a drink called laudanum and
something called Mrs winslow soothing

146
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,290
syrup.
That was a small trace of opiates,

147
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:51,981
right?
Again,

148
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,190
they disappear.
Most popular form becomes heroin when

149
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,920
you ban a drug,
only the most extreme forms of that

150
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,840
drugs have become available now.
Now,

151
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,970
most people who smoke cannabis don't
want skunk,

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,920
right?
Just like if I go into bar around the

153
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:07,430
corner from here today,
probably very few people are can be

154
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,680
drinking vodka and no one's going to be
drinking absinthe,

155
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,140
right?
If you're concerned about the more

156
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,330
extreme forms of the drug,
which I think we should be with cannabis

157
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,760
because there is,
it's not a huge relationship,

158
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,460
but there's some relationship with
dysfunctional behavior.

159
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,470
Then you want to pay a really high
premium on getting milder forms of the

160
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,980
drug available,
so almost all the users he wanted.

161
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,540
Right.
So that's another effect that happens

162
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,520
with legalization and you know,
one of the things that,

163
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,800
so moving everywhere I went,
but they've moved beyond the war on

164
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,610
drugs from Portugal where they
decriminalized all drugs to Switzerland

165
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:39,500
where they legalized heroin addicts to
Erg.

166
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,370
Why and Washington and Colorado where
they legalized cannabis.

167
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,870
The pattern was always the same.
It is super controversial at first and

168
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,270
understandably,
people are really worried and then they

169
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,550
see the effects.
It's not a silver bullet.

170
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,590
There's still problems,
but there's such a significant

171
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:59,110
improvement that the support massively
rises.

172
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:04,111
So 55 percent of people in Colorado
voted to legalize in 2015 today.

173
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,500
Seventy percent of people support it.
Governor Hickenlooper who opposed it now

174
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,260
says it works really well.
They've had a huge increase in tax

175
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,750
revenue.
I interviewed one former police officer.

176
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,530
He told me a story about this that
really stayed with me one day in the

177
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:18,770
seventies.

178
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,710
He was staking out a dealer in a car
park in Wayne,

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,760
New Jersey in plain clothes,
and a kid came up to him and said,

180
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,023
hey,
Mr,

181
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,130
where you go into that liquor store and
buy me some bs.

182
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:33,490
I'm not allowed to until young.
It was like a 12 year old or something,

183
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,521
and he said,
no,

184
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,870
get out of here.
What are you talking about?

185
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,330
Get out of here.
So the kid walked over to the drug

186
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,130
dealer and bought some drugs from him
instead.

187
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,170
And he had this kind of epiphany.
He's like,

188
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,570
oh,
actually,

189
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,930
legalization,
illegal regulated system puts a barrier

190
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,300
between children and drugs that does not
currently exist.

191
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,150
If you're a parent who doesn't want your
child to smoke cannabis,

192
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,890
and if you're a parent,
you shouldn't because there is evidence

193
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,130
that it can impair development.
Um,

194
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,000
for teenagers,
you want to put a really high premium on

195
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,100
getting cannabis out of the hands of
armed criminal gangs.

196
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,320
You don't care whether the customers are
13,

197
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,310
30 or 80 and getting into the hands of
licensed legal,

198
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,140
regulated businesses who have something
to lose.

199
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,190
This is why in Colorado all the research
shows that's been a really significant

200
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,200
fall in cartel and organized crime
activities.

201
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,870
They legalized.
There's been a fallen teenagers using.

202
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,580
It was already quite low,
but it's fallen.

203
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,010
There's been a massive increase in tax
revenue.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
You know,
it's not perfect.

205
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,710
There were some things I would have
tweaked in the Colorado legalization,

206
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,260
but you know,
you can tweak a legal market,

207
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,810
wouldn't have any power over an illegal
market.

208
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,150
There's nothing we can do about it.
Right?

209
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,580
At some point,
the president of Switzerland,

210
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,940
Ruth Dreifuss,
when she made the case to the threats,

211
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,370
people for legalizing heroin,
it.

212
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,790
She's one of the great heroes I've ever
met in my life.

213
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,000
She explained to them,
you know,

214
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,340
when you hear the word legalization is
picture like anarchy and chaos.

215
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,660
What we have now is anarchy and chaos.
You have unknown criminals selling

216
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,870
unknown chemicals to unknown drug users.
All in the dark,

217
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,720
all filled with violence,
right?

218
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,840
Legalization is the way we restore order
to this chaos.

219
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,850
At some point we have to look at the
results.

220
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:12,030
It's worked incredibly well,
and let's look at the places that are

221
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,840
maintaining a criminal warrant cannabis.
How's that working out for you?
