1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,280
The public is of the view that we should
get out of Iraq and be,

2
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:16,281
we should be very careful about the use
of force or our resources are stressed,

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,420
stretched.
We just have had a bad experience in

4
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,280
though that always,
that always tends to sour people and the

5
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:26,190
use of force.
But if you look at the way Americans

6
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:30,930
feel about the legitimacy of using
military force as a way of dealing with

7
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,140
international problems,
it's much stronger than it is in many

8
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,480
parts of Europe.
It is a,

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,400
there's still more support in the United
States for preemptive war,

10
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:46,401
even given disillusionment with Iraq
than there is among our European allies.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,980
So,
um,

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,030
to ensure that Americans are sort of
down on war right now.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,820
Uh,
but the public has a very Jacksonian

14
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,190
view of,
uh,

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,550
of,
um,

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,400
of,
uh,

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
of the use of military force generally
their los to do things but hurt us or

18
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:11,050
threaten us and we'll go at you.
Uh,

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,250
but the public is also very pragmatic
when things aren't working,

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,700
they want out and they don't want to see
a American lives wasted.

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,610
Well,
not strictly,

22
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,760
but certainly the influence of public
opinion on you can't conduct a war

23
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:29,980
without public support in the long run.
That's what that was.

24
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,520
The message of Vietnam and the pressure
to get troops out of it,

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,280
get some sense that we're on our way
out.

26
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:38,360
His very great and,
uh,

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,880
I don't think it will be the only
factor,

28
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,890
but it's one factor in the way.
Uh,

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,153
uh,

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Iraq will play on
the.
