1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,890
My name is Neil Martin.
Um,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,900
my title is I like to be known.
I am a author of habit.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,500
The 95% of behavior marketers ignore.
And I am the founder and CEO of

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:18,720
intellect,
a consulting company in Atlanta.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,330
The real idea just came from watching my
daughter use her cell phone,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,470
you know,
teenager,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,350
you know,
on the couch right beside the landline

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,090
phone and you know,
something occurred to her.

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,870
She was online and she just whips her
cell phone out and called a friend.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,720
And you know,
the parent in me reacted like all

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,730
parents do like wait a second,
that one cost me money,

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,320
the other one's free,
you know,

13
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,050
use that one.
But then I realized that what she had

14
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,640
done,
she had done unconsciously and it was a

15
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,100
habit.
And so I do a lot of work with

16
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,600
communications companies and I really
started thinking about that idea about,

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,710
you know,
what we do unconsciously might explain a

18
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,420
lot,
a lot of the big problems with

19
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,170
marketing.
So when I did my phd in marketing was on

20
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,060
customer satisfaction,
and it was,

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,430
you know,
did all this research tonight,

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,440
you know,
all this complicated mathematical

23
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,970
modeling.
And then I did this,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,680
you know,
large scale analysis of all this

25
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:12,480
research and discovered that customer
satisfaction tells us almost nothing so

26
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,870
that if I know how satisfied you are,
I cannot predict what you're going to do

27
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:16,704
it.

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,550
Yes.
