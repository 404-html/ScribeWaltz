1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,370
Yeah,
so a big question,

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,840
uh,
if,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,950
if anybody's seen the movie minority
report where people are arrested for

4
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:15,190
crimes before they actually commit them,
just because the data suggests they're

5
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:17,050
going to commit a crime.
Uh,

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,140
are we entering this world with so much
data available?

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,650
Uh,
and are definitely our clues on the

8
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:27,580
Internet that people are considering
committing a crime.

9
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:30,130
I mean,
people really do tie how to kill your

10
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:34,300
girlfriend on Google or a how to commit
a murder.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,550
Uh,
and uh,

12
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:39,160
so what should we do with this
information as a society?

13
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:40,870
I think we have to be really,
really careful.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,820
Uh,
there's uh,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,360
an ethical and privacy reasons to be
careful as a society.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,240
It's not supposed to be illegal to have
bad thoughts,

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,370
uh,
but I think there's also a data science

18
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,260
reason for this.
One of the things that you do see in

19
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:58,261
this data is that a lot of people have
horrific thoughts or make horrific

20
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:01,600
searches without ever going through with
a horrific action.

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,940
Uh,
so it may be that when we have all this

22
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:05,320
data,
we think we're going to be able to

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,070
figure out like exactly who's at risk of
committing a crime or doing something

24
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,900
bad,
but it may be that it's just really,

25
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,780
really hard because a huge percentage of
people look really,

26
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,450
really bad on paper,
uh,

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,870
but never go through with the action.
There's a study of prosper,

28
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,870
a peer to peer lending,
uh,

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,291
from,
uh,

30
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:28,291
so people can apply for loans and
scholars analyzed the loan application,

31
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,830
what people wrote in their loan
application and whether they paid back

32
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:37,540
their loan and they found that you could
predict whether someone will pay back

33
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:42,070
the loan based on the words that person
used in their loan application.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,760
So if a person uses the phrase,
I promise they're are much less likely

35
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:51,520
to pay back a loan because I guess
everybody lies.

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,710
So I promise is a,
is a clue that you're not going to pay

37
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:55,750
back the loan.
And one of them,

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,870
one of the more striking indicators,
one of the single highest indicators

39
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:02,500
you're not going to pay back a loan is
if you use the word God in your loan

40
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,450
application,
uh,

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,010
and this is kind of a little bit eerie
and suggest a potentially dark future.

42
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:13,540
It means that someone,
a lender would be wise to not give a

43
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,000
loan to anybody who mentions God.
If someone says,

44
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,320
God bless you,
uh,

45
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,670
in a loan application,
they are put together in a large group

46
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,940
of other people who tend on average not
to pay back their loans.

47
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,980
So there's real danger to some of this
big data where a lot of the correlation,

48
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,080
everything kind of correlates with
everything else.

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,290
And sometimes for reasons that we have,
don't understand some words people use

50
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:42,340
or likes they have on facebook,
predict that they're going to do bad

51
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,680
things even if they're not really going
to do bad things.

52
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,930
And they may be punished without even
realizing why.

53
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,180
Uh,
one thing you see in the Google search

54
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:53,590
data related to religion is the
questions people have and they're

55
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,990
usually concentrated in the Bible belt.
Uh,

56
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,910
but people have kind of loaded about
God.

57
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:05,200
So why does God allow bad things to
happen to good people are,

58
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,010
why does God allow suffering?
Or why does God needs so much praise?

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,780
Uh,
these are questions that people might

60
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,820
not raise a loud because,
uh,

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,550
you know,
they don't want to share their doubts

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,030
with others,
but they turn to Google and ask them

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,810
really,
really loaded questions about the

64
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,660
stories that they hear a related to
religion.
