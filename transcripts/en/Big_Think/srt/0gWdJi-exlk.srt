1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,023
The key issue when you're looking at 
cost cutting is to always plan for the 

2
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,560
future.
Uh,

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,710
the first set of,
of,

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,300
of questions ask yourself when you're 
doing cost cutting is,

5
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,840
is relatively straight forward,
which is,

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,790
you know,
can you use the,

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,720
the necessity of cost cutting as an 
opportunity to do pruning a trimming for

8
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,090
projects that aren't being as 
successful.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,600
Um,
but you know,

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,330
frequently though,
those are the easy ones.

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,120
I mean there's always some kind of 
social costs internal to the company,

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,954
but,
but that's the easy way of looking 

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
future.
Then the more difficult is,

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,320
is if you have to make decisions about 
resource allocations,

15
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:45,150
about what you can apply to going to the
future.

16
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,320
And,
uh,

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,310
the algorithm or the,
the thought analysis that you apply when

18
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,070
you look at this kind of cost cutting 
tends to be okay,

19
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:53,904
which of these things are most likely to
return the company to a very strong 

20
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,480
position by which it can rigorously 
invest in its future.

21
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,020
And so the projects that make it are the
ones that you know,

22
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,854
and those of course usually involve 
people and resources are the ones that 

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,600
you are investing in your future.
And,

24
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,160
and that's,
that's the key algorithm.

25
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,080
Look at him and,
and,

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,570
and whatever level of depth you need to 
do.

27
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,240
You always looking to how do I rebuild 
this thing into the future?

28
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,610
Managing risk is a key variable for 
frankly all aspects of life businesses,

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,753
just one of them.
And one of the things that most people 

30
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,420
do in terms of managing risks,
that's,

31
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,403
that's,
that's actually bad thinking is they 

32
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,670
think they can manage risk.
Cause zero everything has some risks.

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,320
You know,
you drive your car down the street,

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,393
drunk driver may hit you.
So what you're doing is you're actually 

35
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:44,540
trying to get to an acceptable level of 
risk.

36
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,430
Now in economic crisis times,
the kinds of things you're looking at is

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,740
it's generally harder to get capital a 
revenue growth.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,593
Maybe more revenue lines may be unstable
or growth may be a less easy to predict 

39
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,940
that you're going to get to.
And so,

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,193
uh,
what you do is you take a certain 

41
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:01,874
conservative approach of when,
as all entrepreneurs should do you plan 

42
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:06,350
for both good luck and bad luck.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,870
You put extra time on,
okay,

44
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:10,640
if I have bad luck,
what do I do about that?

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,880
And that doesn't mean that,
for example,

46
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:14,714
you,
you planned that the bad luck of 

47
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:16,214
certainly going to happen,
but you're ready to adjust your 

48
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,160
strategy,
iterate,

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,940
uh,
interact and,

50
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,630
and presume that you have bad luck.
So in for example,

51
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:27,140
a financing circumstance,
what if financing is much more difficult

52
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:27,974
to get the new thing?
Do you have the contingent monitoring 

53
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,440
points and the contingent,
uh,

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,590
you know,
I'm like,

55
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:34,424
okay,
here's what we can do in order to keep 

56
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,220
this company going and build it into the
future.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Even if financing is difficult,
times of economic crisis can change what

58
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:50,140
the competitive landscape looks like.
Because when,

59
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:50,974
for example,
you have boom times capital's easy to 

60
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:54,250
come by,
growth as easy.

61
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,350
Sometimes what you focus on is how to 
accelerate in the boom during,

62
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,910
uh,
economic crises.

63
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,270
The question is the companies that come 
out of,

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,980
you know,
there are sailing through that with the,

65
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,700
the best liquidity,
both assets on the balance sheet,

66
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,760
making money,
ability to grow their businesses,

67
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,770
get a disproportionate competitive 
advantage.

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,980
So one of the really key things to look 
at in terms of,

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,833
of crafting strategy when you're in an 
economic crisis is how do you maximize 

70
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,590
your look,
your essentially your liquidity position

71
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:31,360
and your ability to both take kind of 
profits and revenues and in business and

72
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,780
then convert that into a stronger lead.
And so those companies can do that,

73
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,100
can,
can actually,

74
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,060
uh,
you know,

75
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,890
uh,
get a march on the competitors.

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,953
The key thing for all businesses,
and especially of course technology 

77
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:47,224
businesses or businesses that deploy 
technology as a key kind of strategic 

78
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,980
advantage is you always have to be 
investing in the future.

79
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,203
Uh,
technological change comes at 

80
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,900
accelerating rights.
There are such things as,

81
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,460
you know,
Moore's law and that sort of thing.

82
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,623
And that kind of bubbles up into kind of
more feature sets and competitive 

83
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:05,404
ability.
So the key thing is to invest in the 

84
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,254
future.
And what that means is when you're 

85
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:13,030
deploying technology or you're a 
technology business is to make sure that

86
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,460
you're keeping on the innovation cycle 
where you're,

87
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,323
you're,
you're both creating and adopting the 

88
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,384
new business practices and the new 
techniques in order to drive your 

89
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,220
business the right way.
Now a really key thing in terms of doing

90
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,054
that is staying in touch with the people
in your network and in your industry to 

91
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,564
know what the benchmark is,
to know what you should be doing in 

92
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,444
terms of,
you know,

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,313
what are the tools and techniques 
available and to be revving them as you 

94
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:38,500
go.

95
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
And that is,
that is essential for B for maintaining 

96
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,214
a competitive edge and being successful 
if your business and kind of serious 

97
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:49,924
trouble,
you have to make a decision about 

98
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,484
whether or not you have a Sufi.
It's almost like on an investor or 

99
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:56,260
venture capitalist,
the decision can you take the assets are

100
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,900
my you are and get to a place where 
you're investing in the future.

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,570
And if you're not,
then you need to look for,

102
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,590
you know,
essentially,

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,390
you know,
how do you,

104
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,690
how do you,
how do you mass,

105
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,520
how do you,
how do you get the business to the place

106
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,220
where it can invest in the future?
One is sell the business.

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,180
Another is getting strong financing and 
kind of reinvest in the business.

108
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,014
The way of doing that,
the key thing in any kind of guiding of 

109
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,333
the business is how do you create a 
strong organization that is kind of 

110
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,850
accelerating into the future.
And when you're in trouble,

111
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,070
the question is what are the techniques 
that you can,

112
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,270
you know,
Trim,

113
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,030
refinance,
soule,

114
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:33,070
et Cetera in order to get this business 
back to that characteristic.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,040
The CEO's job is always about 
leadership.

116
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,500
It's about leadership on a vision in 
terms of where you're going.

117
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,363
It's about making sure that people,
that you have the regular organization 

118
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,144
and staff and that you have kind of 
clearly communicated what some of the 

119
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,434
plays are and what some of the goals are
in terms of the business and how do you 

120
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,180
organize together in order to make that 
happen.

121
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,210
So the key thing for a CEO to keep their
head in the game is recognize that those

122
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,170
turbulent times plan for,
you know,

123
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,200
bad luck as well as good luck.
Uh,

124
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,860
keep people,
uh,

125
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,270
focused on what the key business wins 
are and,

126
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,133
you know,
provide the energy that people always 

127
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,480
need in order to,
you know,

128
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,591
uh,
you know,

129
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:16,424
to go into battle because you know,
work is hard and go into work and do 

130
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,680
that well and provide a good leadership.
You can for that.

131
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,813
In other words,
it's the same thing that makes good 

132
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,520
leadership in any of that.
