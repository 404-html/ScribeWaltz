1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,750
So there,
there's,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,550
there's a whole lot of them,
75 percent of medical costs stem from

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,150
behavioral and cultural issues over
eating,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,730
eating too much corn syrup,
smoking,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,210
lack of exercise,
the basics,

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,320
the absolute basics are causing
tremendous cost in the system and

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,930
tremendous misery among the people who
have these conditions,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,100
helping people understand their role in
their own health,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,240
helping people move through a mental
space where they actually participate in

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,780
making their health better,
which ends up producing costs for their

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:40,530
companies,
for their insurance companies is what we

12
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,760
need to use this technology to do.
And lots of people might respond to the

13
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,100
ability to earn money by keeping
yourself healthy.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,910
But some people might not.
Some people might only respond to other

15
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,020
motivations like losing money or social
pressure or

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,790
entertainment or,
um,

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,660
uh,
being in the know,

18
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,630
being helpful to others.
If you give someone an opportunity to be

19
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,840
helpful to others with your condition,
you see their health improved

20
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,030
dramatically for some personality types.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,790
And our last company tickle,
we had 100 million registered users.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,840
20 billion questions answered.
We had five phds on staff or on the

23
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:20,280
psychology of your personality and were
you working on sort of taking that,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,960
that understanding about human
motivations and creating a set of

25
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:29,270
experiences which address the seven or
eight main motivation types which apply

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,290
to seven or eight different personality
types,

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,790
is gonna start to deepen our ability to
help people move through behavioral

28
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:40,791
changes they need to make to really
change their health and the costs of,

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,170
of their health,
of maintaining their health.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,630
And so that's,
that's one of the things that we're

31
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,580
trying to do.
The,

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,400
the main costs come from diabetes,
heart disease,

33
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,510
obesity and asthma and allergies.
Those are the sort of main low hanging

34
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,770
fruits.
That's where if you look at where your

35
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,420
costs are coming from,
that's where they're coming from.

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,190
And you know,
diabetes is an epidemic in this kind of

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,500
88 percent of people have diabetes at
this point.

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,893
Um,
that's,

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,740
that's a major cost center.
So,

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,080
uh,
going after those diseases with these

41
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,110
new methodologies.
You know,

42
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,340
we've tried a disease management in the
past,

43
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,360
but it's generally been only going after
one personality type,

44
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:25,890
which is a nurse calls you twice a week
to berate you into maintaining your

45
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,960
health.
That works for some people but only

46
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:32,310
works for one personality type.
You need to apply many more tools to

47
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:36,150
getting people to change their behavior
and you need to deploy them in a much

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,680
more cost effective way,
which having an expensive nurse called

49
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:44,190
twice a week to the whole population is
pretty expensive way to do it.

50
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,450
And,
and so those are models that have

51
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,000
failed,
but there are many more models to try

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
and some of them are going to work over
the next five or 10 years.

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,220
And so that's what Med ped is as a
platform for trying out all these

54
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:57,980
different ideas and then capturing the
stats about what's working and then

55
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,910
iterating on that and,
and focusing people on the things that

56
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,740
are actually working,
evidenced based,

57
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,110
sort of behavioral change.
Uh,

58
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:05,761
and,
and that's,

59
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,750
that's where we're going.
Another,

60
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,360
another big cost center is a
misdiagnosis.

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,680
So in your local area,
you're going to have a physician

62
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:19,250
diagnose you and they may or may or not,
may or may not have the uptodate

63
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,360
information about
how to diagnose someone with these

64
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,230
sayings.
It's estimated that up to upwards of 40

65
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,700
percent of serious cancer cases are
misdiagnosed.

66
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,670
Not that you don't have lung cancer,
it's just what type of lung cancer and

67
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,320
the stage you're at.
It could be misdiagnosed,

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,500
which causes you to have the wrong drugs
with the wrong program for taking those

69
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:44,470
drugs at the wrong treatments.
And if it's 40 percent,

70
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,530
that's an incredible cost to the person
to be misdiagnosed and an incredible

71
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,900
cost to the system to have to treat them
for five or six months in the wrong way

72
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,490
before they actually get to the proper
treatment.

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,960
So that's another way that Med ped can
help is by processing the information,

74
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,610
uh,
more effectively,

75
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,920
uh,
and having the most up to date stuff

76
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,370
available to everyone,
including your local physician who can

77
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,400
then tap into that knowledge base and
help,

78
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,580
uh,
help that physician diagnose you

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,120
properly.
More often than not.
