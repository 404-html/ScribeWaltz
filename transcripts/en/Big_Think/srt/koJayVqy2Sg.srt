1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,570
My first job was one when I was still a
college student.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,050
Um,
I was an officer,

3
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:16,400
a young father the first time.
Um,

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,140
and I don't know if,
if my age contributed to my,

5
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,030
um,
a terror,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,610
uh,
that's something might ever happen to

7
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:28,070
this child.
Um,

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,000
but having children in my life,
uh,

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,600
uh,
having them be such a presence in my

10
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,540
life for as long as they have been.
Um,

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,200
uh,
that boy was born when I was 22.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,680
I'm 67 now and my 18 year old still
lives under my roof in,

13
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:51,600
in my house,
um,

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,010
for another year before he's off to
university.

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,290
Um,
and,

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,200
uh,
that's kind of a long time,

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,850
uh,
from the age of 22 to 67,

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,890
uh,
to have had one or more of my children

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,330
living at home with me for all those
years.

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,050
It certainly has informed what I write
about how childhood and adolescence,

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,490
uh,
are in 10 out of 12 of my novels.

22
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,740
Such,
um,

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,800
uh,
a vital part of the story.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,820
Uh,
so I suppose it would surprise no one to

25
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:39,220
think that my principal anxieties,
um,

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,260
in my real life or parental,
their anxieties,

27
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,860
um,
for my children and by extension now for

28
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,820
my grandchildren and,
um,

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,860
and for my wife,
for it,

30
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,670
for everyone.
I love,

31
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,431
I,
I,

32
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:58,610
um,
I'm a natural worrier.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,580
It,
it's what I do for a living.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,040
I create characters that I'm very fond
of and visited upon them.

35
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:12,020
The worst things I can imagine,
it's as you might well understand it,

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,500
it's,
it's hard not to do that when you leave

37
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,260
your office,
um,

38
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,070
you don't have the opportunity to stick
your imagination under your desk and say

39
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,770
hello to it again.
And the next morning it comes with you

40
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,440
write it,
it goes where you go.

41
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,540
Um,
so with three children and four

42
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,870
grandchildren,
I have a lot to worry about,

43
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,750
um,
before I turned my attention to the

44
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:41,110
state of the world.
But it's,

45
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:45,620
it's not that that leaves me an
entirely,

46
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,454
uh,
uh,

47
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,900
at ease either.
