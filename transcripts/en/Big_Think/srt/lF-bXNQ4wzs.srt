1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,990
If you don't have anything to look up
to,

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,930
you don't have anything to do,
right?

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,830
A lot of the meaning that people find in
their lives is purpose driven.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,370
And in order to put effort into
something,

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,230
to work towards something,
you have to assume axiomatically that

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:27,350
what you're working towards is better
than what you have because why else

7
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:30,230
would you do it?
And there's a relationship,

8
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,000
like if it's way better than what you
have,

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,890
it's obviously proportionally difficult.
So you try to balance difficulty with,

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,500
with positivity,
let's say something like that.

11
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,950
But you're always aiming up if you're
aiming and if you're not aiming,

12
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:46,580
then you don't really have any purpose.
And that deprives your life of meaning.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,400
And that's not good.
Because if your life is deprived of

14
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,050
meaning,
then what you're left with is the

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,090
suffering.
It's not neutral,

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,020
right?
It's negative.

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,290
So now the problem with having to a mop
is that that produces a hierarchy,

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:00,980
right?

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,980
Because if you pause it an aim,
then everyone a raise themselves along a

20
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:10,580
hierarchy of better at it,
to worse at it,

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,440
right?
And it doesn't matter.

22
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:13,910
Like if,
if you,

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,740
if you create basketball as a game a
hundred years later,

24
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,410
you create people who are hyper
specialized at basketball and they're

25
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:24,500
great at it and virtually everyone else
is bad.

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,410
So it doesn't matter.
As soon as you produced a value,

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,840
a value proposition,
you produce a hierarchy.

28
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,690
The problem with the hierarchy is it
produces inequality.

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,440
The problem with inequality is it
produces resentment,

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,410
right?
But you can't get rid of the damn

31
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:42,710
hierarchy because they produce
inequality and resentment because then

32
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,590
you don't have anywhere to go.
So that's not an answer.

33
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,280
Okay?
So let's say you're trying to deal with

34
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,380
the fact that you have to put up with a
hierarchy.

35
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:53,090
If you're going to have any values,
well,

36
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:55,040
how do you escape from the resentment
trap?

37
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,470
And the answer is you do an intelligent
multidimensional analysis of your life.

38
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,680
It's like,
by the time you're 30 I would say you're

39
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,230
a pretty singular person.
You know,

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,103
you're,
you're,

41
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,960
you're unique in particular and your
life has multiple dimensions and you're

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,560
more or less successful,
or not along many of those dimensions,

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,800
but it's completely ridiculous game to
pick someone else arbitrarily who's

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,140
doing much better than you on one of
those dimensions,

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,920
to assume that you're a failure because
of that or that the world is unfair

46
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:31,640
because of that,
without knowing in full detail all of

47
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,890
the rest of the elements of their lives.
I mean,

48
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:36,500
look,
we're absolutely the awash in stories of

49
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,720
unhappy celebrities.
You know,

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,880
[inaudible] an interminable divorces or
an in affairs or in addictions or,

51
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,590
and that's par for the course.
It's not helpful.

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,670
It's helpful to have a goal.
It's necessary to have a hierarchy.

53
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,320
It's not particularly useful to compare
yourself to other people,

54
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,550
but it is useful.
Compare yourself to yourself.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,440
That's the right baseline,
right?

56
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,490
That's takes everything else into
account and,

57
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,740
and it's really practically useful.
And I,

58
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:10,000
I've done this in my clinical practice
very frequently.

59
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,511
It's like,
okay,

60
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:13,300
let's take stock of where you are.
Okay?

61
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,120
And then let's,
let's hypothesize about where you would

62
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,950
like to be.
It's a complex conversation,

63
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,050
right?
Because we want to figure out what's not

64
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,450
so good about your present situation.
Exactly.

65
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,780
Precisely.
And then come up with a hypothesis about

66
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,090
what your life would look like if it was
better.

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,060
And then we can work on incremental
improvement.

68
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,170
No idea would be,
there's some step you could take that

69
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:40,171
you would take that would make today or
tomorrow fractionally better than

70
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,780
yesterday.
Right?

71
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,590
And then you can iterate that and that's
actually unbelievably powerful.

72
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:47,840
[inaudible]

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,130
you hit the effect of compounding
interest,

74
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,020
let's say very,
very rapidly if you do that.

75
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,420
Yeah,
well,

76
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,700
so there's real utility and incremental
progress and you don't have to improve

77
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,780
your life much in increments to start
hitting the effect of compounding

78
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,820
interest.
You know,

79
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,450
you make one thing slightly better and
that increases the probability that

80
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,900
you'll make the next things slightly
better as well as having its positive

81
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,000
side effects.
And so if you,

82
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,090
even if you make small steps forward and
you do that regularly,

83
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,050
that can turn your life around very
rapidly over like a one to two year

84
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,980
period.
I mean,

85
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,480
that's a long time,
one to two years.

86
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,170
But it's not a lifetime and it certainly
beats the hell out of going downhill

87
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,930
precipitously,
which tends to be the alternative.

88
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,430
So it's better and it keeps you out of
the resentment,

89
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,000
you know?

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,970
And it's also more realistic because
it's not like,

91
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,020
it's not like everyone else doesn't have
their problems.

92
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,441
You know,
we,

93
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:47,441
we have these fictitious successful
people that it's easy for us to compare

94
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:51,580
ourselves to detrimentally and to become
jealous and bitter about that,

95
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:54,520
but also to be very hard on ourselves
because we're not successful.

96
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:58,390
It's like if you talk to successful
people,

97
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,740
let's say,
and I'm not trying to say that there's

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,700
no such thing as genuine accomplishment
because obviously there is,

99
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,240
but people,
even people who are successful have

100
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,090
lives that are very difficult and you
know,

101
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,924
they have,
uh,

102
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,020
an ill family member or aged parents or,
or they're suffering from some serious

103
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,860
illness themselves,
which is very,

104
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,930
very common.
Or they have a psychological problem

105
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,060
that's not trivial or they have a
traumatic past.

106
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,550
It's like life is brutal.
And,

107
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,710
and becoming resentful about your
relative position is a way to make it

108
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,960
more brutal.
It's not helpful to you and it's not

109
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,100
helpful to anyone else.

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,120
Yeah.
