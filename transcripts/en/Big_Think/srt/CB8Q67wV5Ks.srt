1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,380
Yes,
we have a foundation and the website,

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,880
yes,
dot org.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,770
It's a foundation.
I started a few years ago and we started

4
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,771
it because we wanted to bring self
esteem back to Haiti and currently 7,000

5
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:30,330
kids have scholarships.
We started something which is called hip

6
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:35,160
hop,
hip hop for health mobile clinics going

7
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:39,210
throughout Haiti.
I'm giving people HIV tests,

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,000
giving them condoms,
but through music there's also a

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,690
children's prison program where we've
went into these prisons,

10
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:52,410
whether it's kids introduce chest took
over the prisons,

11
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:56,370
but more beds,
basketball courts and these kids were

12
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,290
reading.
And um,

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,510
every time I go down there and tears
come to my eyes because I knew I wasn't

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,530
the beginning.
A lot of these kids was in gangs.

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,740
Um,
most terrible violence you could think

16
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:12,741
about a yearly is actually the movement
is really working and it's,

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,270
it's the greatest thing is when I look
at a kid and I noticed that

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,060
I can rise his self esteem because
someone rose myself esteem.

19
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,250
That's why I'm here as yelling.

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,190
Well,
the first thing is

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,180
we have a documentary coming out which
is called CRI.

22
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,000
Haiti.
And this is my work on the ground for

23
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,560
the past three years.
Um,

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,660
I didn't leave the ground until I felt
that the people on the ground understood

25
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:47,140
what we was doing and was training.
So I kept going back and forth,

26
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,900
back and forth.
And now I feel like we have great a

27
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,600
great team on the ground.
We have a great ngos,

28
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,720
but to get it,
it took three years of me going back and

29
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,900
forth to Haiti.
A lot of times when you starting

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,930
foundations for it to really work,
you have to be hands on for the first

31
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,480
couple of years.
And I'm in in right now.

32
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,100
It's a natural will.
It's.
