1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,920
One of the concepts that comes up over
and over again.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,840
Prolific creative minds that I've
interviewed for the Tim Ferriss show or

3
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,620
for the book tools of titans is creating
empty space.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,370
And one of the guests,
Josh Waitzkin,

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,670
who never does any media,
can I curse on this?

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,810
Yeah.
He always texts me with profanity laden

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,660
SMS is because I'm the only one who can
pull them out of his cave,

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,951
uh,
to do media.

9
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,570
But he is best known perhaps as the
chess prodigy.

10
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,990
And I'll explain why I put that in air
quotes besides how funny it looks on

11
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,610
camera,
uh,

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,020
that form the basis or who formed the
basis for searching for Bobby Fischer,

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,080
both the book and the movie.
He was very well known chess player and

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,730
continues to be an incredible chess
player,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,420
but he has applied his learning
framework to more than chess.

16
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,890
So he was a world champion and touchy
push hands is the first black belt in

17
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,160
Brazilian Jujitsu under the phenol and
probably the best of all time.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,800
Marcelo Garcia who trains in New York
City,

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,740
I think he's a nine time world champion,
something like that.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,851
And,
uh,

21
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:15,300
he's now tackling paddle surfing and he
can apply to just about anything.

22
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,970
He works with some of the top financial
minds in the world,

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,910
hedge fund managers and beyond the best
of the best,

24
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:23,040
top 1%.
So why?

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,380
What are the principles that he shares?
One of them is uh,

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,420
creating empty space,
cultivating empty space as a way of

27
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,920
life.
And these are all tied together so much.

28
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:36,870
And another one,
learning the macro from the micro and

29
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,650
then beginning with the end in mind.
And these all work together.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,050
So I'll explain.
In fact,

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,670
the last two first Josh learned to play
chess,

32
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:52,671
or I should say more accurately,
was coached by his first real coach in

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
the opposite direction when compared to
most training and most chess books.

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,540
He was taught in reverse.
What does that mean?

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,860
He began with the end game and with very
few pieces.

36
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:08,190
So they cleared all the pieces off the
board instead of starting with openings.

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,950
Meaning what do you do first?
The first five to 10 moves,

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,050
start with the end game with king and
pawn versus king.

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,110
What does this do?
Well,

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,140
this forces you to focus on principles
like opposition creating space,

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,550
uh,
Zugzwang,

42
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:31,551
which is a principle of forcing your
opponent to do anything that will

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,460
destroy their position or anything they
can possibly do,

44
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:40,461
well worse in their position and these
types of principles that you learn when

45
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,660
there's an empty board with a few
pieces,

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,550
uh,
accomplish a few things.

47
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,220
Number one,
you are learning the macro,

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,080
the principles that you can apply
throughout the game of chess in almost

49
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,130
any scenario,
uh,

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,800
through the micro,
this,

51
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,390
this end game situation.

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,930
And these principles are adaptable.
You become a machine that can bob and

53
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:08,740
weave with the circumstances very
effectively compared to that as josh

54
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:10,510
would put,
put it if you're memorizing the

55
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,920
openings.
Okay.

56
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,410
And this might be like memorizing
recipes.

57
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,830
If you're learning to cook,
uh,

58
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,960
you're effectively stealing the answers
from the teacher's guidebook to a test

59
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,490
and you'll be able to beat your friends
for awhile and,

60
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:25,420
uh,
maybe even be considered a pretty decent

61
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,250
chess player.
But on a deep level,

62
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,870
you don't understand the game and you
will not,

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,150
you'll hit a ceiling and you will never
progress past that.

64
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,570
And you'll get beaten by really good
players so that can be applied to,

65
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,950
for instance,
Brazilian Jujitsu,

66
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,400
Josh told,
taught me basically all of the most

67
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,840
important principles of Jujitsu through
one move at the end game,

68
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,690
which is as a choke called the
guillotine,

69
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,700
which Marcelo was famous for.

70
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,240
His version is called the Marcello teen,
but it's effectively like this.

71
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,330
You're choking someone's head here and
he has a weird way of doing it where he

72
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,490
puts his forum on top of your shoulder.
It's pretty wicked.

73
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,100
If you want to be put unconscious,
you can go to that gym and,

74
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,740
and a experience that yourself,
but uh,

75
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,460
that can also be applied to many,
many other things.

76
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,890
For instance,
if you're trying to build a start up,

77
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,000
all right,
this is,

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
this is a common trendy thing to do
these days and I think everybody should

79
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,910
start a business at some point.
Uh,

80
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,470
but in the startup game in say Silicon
Valley where I live,

81
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,840
if you're going to go into the venture
backed world,

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,440
well you and your founder,
but I think a lot about the end game and

83
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:31,090
you should definitely have an agreement,
at least a working agreement,

84
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,520
a tentative agreement on what type of
exit,

85
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,980
say acquisition offer is acceptable to
you.

86
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,550
If those those end goal components
aren't in place,

87
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,050
then it's just a slow motion train wreck
waiting to happen.

88
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,240
And how might you do that?
Well,

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,460
if you're trying to learn the macro from
micro,

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,990
you could think about what the
acquisition agreement might look like.

91
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,380
So you could talk to lawyers,
get a sample template agreement and look

92
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,690
at the provisions,
look at the clauses,

93
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,140
and then reverse engineer it so that
when you're forming the company and when

94
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,890
you're hiring employees,
your decisions at that point make it

95
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,110
possible to have that contract at the
end.

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
This is another example,
micro,

97
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,840
maybe it's a 10 20 page document,
macro building,

98
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,720
a company that gets acquired by a much,
much larger company.

99
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,160
Uh,
so that is learning the macro from the

100
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,300
micro.
Uh,

101
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,700
another example,
just because I brought up cooking would

102
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:32,290
be saying,
choosing a recipe that involves two or

103
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:37,291
three primary techniques and perhaps
three to five primary ingredients that

104
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,190
apply in many,
many,

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,300
many different dishes.

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,820
So you're learning principles of safe
flavor,

107
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,821
combination principles of using
convection versus shallow frying or saw

108
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,660
Tang versus steaming.
Okay.

109
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,090
Uh,
that apply across the board.

110
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,430
And in doing so,
let's say you do without a recipe,

111
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:00,750
without a timer,
uh,

112
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,140
or I should say a meat thermometer or
something like that.

113
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,470
You're going to learn also to test the
food to know whether it has done or not.

114
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,760
That then applies to everything.
But you can do it just learning how to

115
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:15,761
make Harissa crab cakes with steam
Broccoli and I have no idea,

116
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,640
say candied yams,
something like that.

117
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,990
All right,
so that's that.

118
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,360
Now none.
We were also talking about the end game,

119
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,770
so we've covered that,
creating it.

120
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,760
We're cultivating empty spaces,
way of life.

121
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,070
This is very important to Josh Waitzkin,
who I mentioned.

122
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,060
It's very important to people like Paul
Graham who's the Co founder of y

123
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,430
combinator,
which is like the navy seals,

124
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,730
Harvard of startup accelerators,
keeping it simple,

125
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:43,100
let's,
let's just call it that for now.

126
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,980
Creating,
if you are a creator,

127
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:48,800
if you are a maker and not a manager,
this is important.

128
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,000
Creating three to five,
which by the way is a decision.

129
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,700
Uh,
so a lot of really good

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,310
entrepreneurs start as a technician or a
tactician.

131
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,780
They're very,
very good at one thing.

132
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,750
Then they end up in a managerial role
that they hate.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,590
It doesn't mean you have to stay there
and you see a lot of folks like Evan

134
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,190
Williams and others who then at some
point realize this and return to a more

135
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,770
product focused,
uh,

136
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
role.
Even if they are also the CEO making

137
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:22,160
some high level 30,000 foot decisions.
Okay?

138
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,920
But if you are a maker,
if you've decided to be a maker,

139
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,380
if you just happen to be maker or a
creator,

140
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,240
let's call it three to five hour
uninterrupted blocks of time are

141
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,340
extremely critical.
If you want to connect the dots,

142
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,580
if you want to have the space to allow
yourself to have original ideas or at

143
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,830
least our original combinations of
ideas,

144
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,360
you really need to block out that time
and protect it at least once a week.

145
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,630
So in tools of titans,
there are many people who do this.

146
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:52,520
We meet Seti for instance.
There's a very,

147
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,360
very successful,
um,

148
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,630
multi,
multimillion dollar business that he

149
00:07:56,631 --> 00:08:00,230
built out of a blog he started a long
ago in college,

150
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,360
which was very,
very niche.

151
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,490
And its focus,
he blocks out,

152
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:09,320
I believe it's every Wednesday for three
to five hours of time.

153
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,800
He will block it out for learning.
Uh,

154
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,300
Noah Kagan,
another entrepreneur does the same

155
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,220
thing.
So on Wednesdays for me,

156
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:19,430
I have from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM.
This is pre lunch.

157
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,340
I have creation.
That means writing,

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,760
recording or some similar aspect of,
in my mind,

159
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:32,160
creating with,
with my skillset and my assets and a,

160
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,080
it is extremely important that I do that
before I'm barraged by inputs.

161
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,570
In other words,
and this is true of Josh as well.

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,790
First thing in the morning,
he's doing journaling.

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,750
Reid Hoffman,
billionaire go founder or founder of

164
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,370
Linkedin,
same story.

165
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,300
He will plant a seed in his mind the
night before a problem.

166
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,780
He wants to solve a project.
He wants to think about improving

167
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:58,781
perhaps and then waking up row,
Tabula Rasa,

168
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,190
complete blank slate immediately working
on that problem with journaling before

169
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:08,100
any text messages before any email,
which is why for instance,

170
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:11,150
I don't have email set up on my phone,
I do not have mail set up on my iphone

171
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,790
and I did not get notifications.
I also put my phone on airplane mode for

172
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,090
a lot of reasons for the four hour body,
explained some of the physical ones but

173
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,590
on to airplane mode when I go to bed and
it stays in airplane mode until I am

174
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:27,540
done with my creation period.
And then it comes on because as soon as

175
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:32,541
you go into bullet dodging or like
wonder woman bullet blocking mode with

176
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,300
uh,
everyone else's agenda for your time,

177
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
which is very often the inbox or text
messages,

178
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,110
you're Doa,
you'd done your creativity is,

179
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,350
is all for naught in general.
So for,

180
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,020
for me,
for many people who are say,

181
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,260
programming for musicians,
for creative types,

182
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
slack in the system,
you have to create slack.

183
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,880
You have to create space.
You have to create large,

184
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,510
uninterrupted blocks of time.
And the only way to do that is to put it

185
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,640
on your calendar.
If it's not on your calendar,

186
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,950
it's not real.
You need to put it in your calendar and

187
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,630
defend it just like you would anything
else.
