1
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,330
Not doing anything that's substantially
different.

2
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,660
It's a lot of the same techniques you go
up on Capitol Hill,

3
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:22,440
you are trying to get journalists to
write things that are favorable to your

4
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:24,420
cause.
When they don't write things favorable,

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,640
you protest,
um,

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,710
you do the same things that the national
rifle association is.

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:32,040
You make sure that congressmen
understand that if they take positions

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,820
contrary to what you want,
you're going to try to steer campaign

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,790
contributions to the other side if at
all possible.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So the nature of the activities is
pretty similar to what other powerful

11
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,280
groups do as well.
You know,

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,310
why is social security a sacrosanct
third rail issue?

13
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,270
It's because the arp has a position of
that and they can organize their members

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,060
and so politician who suddenly steps up
and says,

15
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:59,550
you know,
I think social security audit be cut is

16
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,650
going to be in real trouble for doing
it.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,020
So at what they're doing is not all that
different.

18
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,500
They are particularly good at it,
but they're not doing anything that's

19
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:12,501
illegitimate with one exception,
which is the tendency to smear anybody

20
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:17,790
who is critical of this relationship for
being antisemitic or being bigoted in

21
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,100
some way though what happened to Jimmy
Carter,

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:22,980
for example,
after he published his book Palestine

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,650
piece,
not a part that is a sort of classic

24
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,670
example of this where he was accused of
being a Nazi sympathizer accused of

25
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,550
being a Jew hater,
etc. Etc.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,660
And this is a prEsident who had done as
much for israeli security as any

27
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:40,860
american president ever has.
That I think is not legitimate because

28
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:43,710
it gets in the way of a free and open
discourse,

29
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,630
which is really essential in a
democracy.

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,560
You could certAinly diminish the impact
of all special interest groups if you

31
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:56,790
could have a really radical campaign
finance reform in the United States.

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,910
it wouldn't end interest group politics,
but it would take some of the fuel out

33
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:05,880
of it and that I don't think is going to
happen in my lifetime because of course

34
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,280
that would get resisted by all special
interest groups.

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,520
not any particular one.
Um,

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,700
I think because there's nothing wrong
with any group of americans,

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,430
uh,
organizing to shape american foreign

38
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,770
policy in ways that they think are good
for the country.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,980
Uh,
I don't favor putting any restrictions

40
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,620
or limits or saying that you guys can
organize.

41
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,650
You can't come up on capital hill
anymore and talk to congressmen.

42
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,770
I think anything like that would be very
anti american,

43
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:35,190
very anti-democratic.
What I hope happens,

44
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:40,191
and I hope our book it helps encourage
is that some of the organizations in a

45
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,450
sort of broad coalition,
which doesn't agree on everything by the

46
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,070
way,
that some of the more moderate groups

47
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,290
and more progressive become more
influential,

48
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,540
gain more supporters.
Um,

49
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,600
and similarly,
some of the more powerful groups now

50
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,720
thAt tend to be more hardline begin to
rethink their positions.

51
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,260
I would have no objection to there being
a very powerful pro Israel community in

52
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,610
the United States if I thought the
policies they were pushing for were

53
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,860
better for us and better for Israel as
well.

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,820
Um,
so I have no problem with there being

55
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,480
the lobby.
I just wish it were pushing for policies

56
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,110
that were smarter.
