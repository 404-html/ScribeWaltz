1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,390
The communication internet is,
is something that's ubiquitous and we're

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,930
using it 24 hours a day.
All of us have our cell phones and our

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:11,610
desktop computers and we're generating
information in the form of audio,

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,970
video and text.
And we're sharing it with friends,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:19,530
were sharing it with the world in a,
in a communication network that's

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:24,330
designed to be distributed,
collaborative and that favors peer to

7
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:27,450
peer production.
Now that Communication Internet is

8
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:32,451
converging with this very nascent energy
internet where we're now able to

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,800
generate our own green electricity,
distributed collaborative peer to peer

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,890
and share it with the help of the
communication internet,

11
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:45,060
we create an energy internet,
a transmission lines become an internet.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,580
And now the third component,
we are just beginning to see the first

13
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:55,581
glimpse of an automated transport and
logistics internet and then the whole

14
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,650
package is complete.
Right now,

15
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,900
logistics is a pretty inefficient
business.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,020
Uh,
if you take a look across the United

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,890
States,
like other countries,

18
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:08,460
and you look at a truck on the road,
sometimes those trucks are empty,

19
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,190
they're deadheading back,
they'd taken their cargo and then

20
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:14,370
there's nothing on the trip back.
Or they only have 20 or 30% of that

21
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,070
truck filled.
Right now,

22
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:20,310
our logistics system is not coordinated
into a network.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,430
There are thousands of warehouses and
distribution centers,

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,900
but every company usually has only five
or 10 of these warehouses somewhere in

25
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,030
the country.
So they have to take their,

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,450
their trains are the trucks all the way
to where they're a handful of centers

27
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,970
are.
But what would happen if all the

28
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,460
thousands of warehouses and distribution
centers,

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,580
privately owned,
came together in a cooperative network.

30
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,900
So if you're a general electric or
Walmart or wherever,

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,060
or a PR,
a small prosumer,

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,320
a small and medium sized company,
you would have access to any one of

33
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:56,760
those warehouses when they have surplus
space and you could move your transport

34
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,320
only where you needed it in real time
instead of going to a few centralized

35
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,630
warehouses across 3000 miles.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,380
But to do that,
you'd have to have common protocols

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,190
where everything is standardized so you
could get your packages through in the

38
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:16,191
same containers with radio recognition
technology like federal express as so

39
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,740
you know where you're,
you're afraid is in your package at any

40
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:23,730
given moment on the supply chain.
And then we're now starting to move

41
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:27,840
toward a driverless vehicles.
There'll be in mass production within

42
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:31,920
five to 10 years everywhere according to
the six major auto companies.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,640
And so we'll be able to have a transport
system where we power our vehicles from

44
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,740
energy from our energy internet and will
power our electric vehicles and fuel

45
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,560
cell cars,
trucks and buses powered by hydrogen,

46
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,860
all of that from our energy internet at
near zero marginal cost transport that's

47
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:55,470
already here in parts of Europe.
We now have electric vehicles,

48
00:02:55,471 --> 00:03:00,020
fuel cell vehicles powered with energy
that's near zero marginal costs.

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,390
In a few years there'll be driverless
reducing the cost even further.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,180
And so this transport and logistics
internet is connecting with the energy

51
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,740
internet and the communication internet,
which provides the data one system.

52
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,140
It is a game changer.
It is one of the great technology

53
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,890
revolutions in history.
It's going to change our entire way of

54
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,780
life.
Every single person.

55
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,770
What it mainly means is it's the
democratization of everything.

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,460
This means that millions of people and
soon billions of people,

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,380
they're not going to have to rely on the
goodwill of a handful of globally

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,450
integrated,
large,

59
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:44,320
vertically integrated companies for the
main stuff of life.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
We've now freed ourselves with
information to zero or near zero

61
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,120
marginal cost.
Millions of us are producing and sharing

62
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:56,170
with each other,
and we now have the first early adopters

63
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:00,520
that are now producing their own green
electricity at near zero marginal costs,

64
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,570
millions of them already,
and we've just starting to see a

65
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,650
transport and logistics internet that
could get us to near zero marginal cost.

66
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,310
This is the democratization of
everything and it's going to change the

67
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,210
economic model.
