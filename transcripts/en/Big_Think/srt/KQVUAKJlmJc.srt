1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,800
Well if I open my refrigerator I'm going
to pay.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm going to hell you and I'm going to
get into Charlotte.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,600
Probably two or three type of either
vegetable or salad or zucchini.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,630
I always have plenty in my refrigerator
along with the beer and and the milk and

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,180
probably some cream as well.
So those are angry at the end that are

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,710
in the refrigerator and in the pantry.
I have a fair amount of canned and from

7
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:37,710
canned tuna.
But again there are quality.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
You can have extraordinary tuna in cans
from pot to get off somewhere else.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,440
I had no long ago with some apricot in
from Morocco.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,130
They were just fantastic.
You know and so again all beans.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,950
I mean different type of beans.
There is nothing wrong with can beans be

12
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,710
good if I could beans.
I will take beans water and salt and

13
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,240
Velveeta.
That's what I'm going to have in that

14
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,550
can.
There is nothing foreign in that camp

15
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:06,120
that I wouldn't want to have in terms of
chemical products or whatever.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,110
Liquid.
Or.

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,803
TO.
MAKE IT.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,110
IT'S.
