1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,460
Where does this come from and why does
gas Zions not have gas moves?

2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,060
Wow,
that is a great question.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,480
Wow.
First of all,

4
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,050
I was alive when people to figure it out
or satisfied themselves as where our

5
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:36,030
moon came from.
And uh,

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,350
it's generally agreed that our moon was
created when the earth was hit with

7
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:44,040
another pretty big thing,
another asteroid.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,610
And uh,
the impact was very hard,

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,310
very hard.
And the energy of the smashing was

10
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:55,311
converted to heat and both the earth and
the moon were hot and molten and they

11
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,570
both cooled off.
And here we are with this other separate

12
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:03,450
thing in orbit around us.
Now,

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,990
why the gas giants not have gas moons is
a great question.

14
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:10,050
And the answer is almost certainly
because of gravity.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,390
So when you have these little things
that spun off of,

16
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,220
let's see,
Jupiter or Saturn,

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,180
they were too small to sustain
themselves as just balls of gas.

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,530
The gas shrunk down and gravity pulled
it down and formed a solid thing.

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,550
Whereas in Jupiter and Saturn,
there's so much,

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,410
uh,
spin,

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,160
so much heat created that they're held,
uh,

22
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,170
in the gaseous state.
Or what we would call gaseous state by

23
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:51,171
the energy that's coming out of them,
whereas the smaller ones cooled off so

24
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:55,020
much that they turned solid.
It's just a fantastic question.

25
00:01:55,021 --> 00:02:00,021
Aria and astrophysicists or planetary
scientists speculate about this all the

26
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,180
time,
but what a fantastic thing that you made

27
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:06,150
this observation,
the moons of Jupiter,

28
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:10,720
the big ones I owes Calista,
um,

29
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,220
uh,
Europa and Ganymede,

30
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,770
those big moons are cooled off.
They're not,

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,040
they're not gaseous like Jupiter that
whom they or what the orbit.

32
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,450
That's fantastic.
Wow.

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,440
And maybe more will be learned about
this and I gotta tell Ya,

34
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,220
Aria,
it's very reasonable that in your

35
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:37,221
lifetime we will send the right
spacecraft to Europa and the moon of

36
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,390
Saturn and sell it us and Titan and look
for signs of life instead of being a gas

37
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:46,350
giant.

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,120
In this one example,
Europa is a moon of Jupiter that is,

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,960
uh,
has twice as much seawater as the earth

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,440
and that water is under a layer of ice.
And I mentioned it because it's evidence

41
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,290
of how things cool off when they're in
space and they're small or relatively

42
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,240
small,
the ice forms.

43
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,420
Because of the heat of,
of creation,

44
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,080
the thing smashed together.
That heat is radiated into space.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,940
So there's a crust of ice,
but the water underneath is kept liquid

46
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,430
by the gravitational exercising of its
orbit around Jupiter.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,990
It's amazing what an Observation Aria,
you're making my day.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,560
I hope you will be involved in missions
to Europa and you will look for signs of

49
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,120
life below the ice.
I mean,

50
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,310
who knows?
If you have an ocean for four and a half

51
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,100
billion years,
things are going to happen.

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,270
It could be living things.
There could be your opinions out there.

53
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,550
Fish people that you'll interact with.
Keep us posted.

54
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,900
Thank you.
