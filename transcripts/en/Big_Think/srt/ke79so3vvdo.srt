1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,890
Mm,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,950
I want to tell you one story,
and the story came from the early 19

3
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:10,080
fifties,
a woman named Wanda,

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:12,570
Ruth Lunsford,
who was the scientist in New York City

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,300
and she published one paper which turned
out to be our one paper in science,

6
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,950
so we just actually push data science.
What she did was she took an old rat in

7
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,990
a young rat.
She put him to sleep and she tied their

8
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,530
skin together.
So after about a day or so,

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,660
their blood supplies joined.
Well,

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,850
several weeks later she looked in that
old rat.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
There were new neurons growing in the
brain,

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,890
the heartbeat stronger,
and the muscles were bigger.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,420
The gray hair term brown again,
she claimed she reversed aging.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,340
People call her dracula or Frankenstein,
all kinds of crazy names.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,080
Well,
earlier this year,

16
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,710
three separate laboratories at Harvard,
Stanford University of California,

17
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:53,040
San Francisco repeated the experiment
and it worked,

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,640
and what they showed is at age 25,
and you and I are stem cells go to sleep

19
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:04,461
and get turned off and proteins from
young mice in this case or young humans

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,020
can turn them back on again.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,780
And when these stem cells get turned
back on,

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,820
new neurons can be growed,
repair happens much quicker and tissue

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,500
and tissue we all see read,
our child breaks his leg.

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,530
He or she are back walking again a
couple of weeks.

25
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:22,050
I don't even know what happened.
Your grandmother breaks her leg and it

26
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,790
hits her quality life the rest of her
life.

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,200
So there are clinical trials now using
proteins that were founding young

28
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,290
individuals to try to stimulate bone
repair in the elderly who have

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,160
fractures.
And so just like a diabetic requires a

30
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,090
shot of insulin so that they can manage
their sugar going forward.

31
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:42,000
If you break your leg in the elderly,
we may just give you a shot of these

32
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,630
proteins to turn back on your stem cells
so you can repair quicker.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,040
We're trying it in cancer because cancer
in kids is about 90 percent curable.

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,560
Once you turn 25,
that same cancer turns incurable.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,880
So maybe if I can give it to the body,
it's younger.

36
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,000
I can have a.
We as a science community can have a

37
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:04,470
bigger impact on cancer.
So I leave you with that bit of hope,

38
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,880
that aging is something that may be able
to be reversed and not so we can live

39
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,910
till I'm 150,
but so that we can all live until our

40
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:16,911
ninth or 10th decade without there being
a decrease in quality in those last

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,350
decades.
Because that'd be the goal quality years

42
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,800
till the end.
