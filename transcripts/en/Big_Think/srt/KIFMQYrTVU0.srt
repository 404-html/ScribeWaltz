1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,550
Utmost respect for snl.
Like,

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,100
you know,
people sometimes take shots at them.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,720
Um,
but I mean I think that's a great show

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,250
and I feel like the cast right now,
they have like a smaller,

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,150
tighter tasks and it's actually like,
I really feel like one of the strongest

6
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,250
casts that that they've had in a long
time.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,270
And,
um,

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,480
you know,
I always feel like people aren't

9
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,060
catching that show every week.
It's only because I,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,040
there might be a perception that like,
oh,

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,530
this is this,
this legendary show.

12
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,364
And,
um,

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,960
um,
people may feel like,

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,750
oh well they'll catch it whenever.
I feel like some of that is due to like

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,390
what we were talking about,
the changing nature of how people are

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,220
finding stuff.
You know,

17
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,470
people watch stuff on the internet and
stuff like that.

18
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,280
But,
um,

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,840
I feel like right now that cast is
totally strong and solid and like pound

20
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,300
for pound I sure like always makes me
laugh.

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,160
I mean,
there's always something funny every

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,570
week on that show.
I think.

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,690
I think the challenge of,
of doing some stuff on that show is just

24
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:08,680
the fact that,
um,

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,130
that it's a live show every week.
I mean it's really hard to do a live

26
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,030
show every week.
And people,

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,650
I think people kind of think like,
um,

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,770
that's not impossible.
It is,

29
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm sure probably impossible to pull
that off.

30
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,140
Um,
it must be exhausting.

31
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,003
So,
um,

32
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,510
yeah,
I always feel like,

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,010
um,
you know,

34
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:35,010
but the thing about comedy is that like
not everything ever hits,

35
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:35,651
you know,
I mean,

36
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,720
comedy is completely subjective.
You know,

37
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,180
no one likes every single thing that we
do.

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,450
Um,
a lot of people don't like any of those.

39
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,590
We'd be like,
my mom,

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,150
my mom,
hey,

41
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:49,360
sorry,
show my mom told me over Christmas that

42
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:51,580
she was like,
we were talking and she goes,

43
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,010
um,
I said something about our show coming

44
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:56,710
on and my mom was like,
um,

45
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm thoroughly embarrassed by your show.
I was like,

46
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,260
what?
She's like,

47
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,460
I think it's crude and it's a vulgar,
and it is,

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,530
I guess it is crude and vulgar,
but,

49
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,940
um,
but you know,

50
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,620
it's,
it's purely subjective.

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,350
And that's the thing with snl too,
like,

52
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,040
um,
you know,

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,600
people watch that and some people will
be like,

54
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,570
oh,
I didn't get it.

55
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,430
But it's like,
well,

56
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,650
comedy is subjective.
Like not everything is going to hit with

57
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,484
you,
but,

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,450
um,
yeah,

59
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,340
that shows,
I always feel like that shows

60
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,780
got some funny,
funny stuff.
