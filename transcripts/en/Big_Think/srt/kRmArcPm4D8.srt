1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,910
Well in the sense that I think we
certainly understand that uh,

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,150
we cannot,
uh,

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,570
we cannot continue to rely on petroleum
is a major source of energy.

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,510
Now there,
there are two dimensions to our

5
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,940
addiction to petroleum.
By the way,

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,590
let's start by saying that petroleum is
our largest single source of energy.

7
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:37,400
About 40% of our energy comes from
petroleum.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,900
This is higher than almost any other
major economic power.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,060
Most of the countries rely on other
sources of energy or a,

10
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:50,300
a bigger spread,
a greater spectrum of energy.

11
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:55,301
We are very petroleum dependent and,
and this is partly because we were once

12
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:59,600
a major petroleum producer.
It was once abundant and cheap.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,040
So,
uh,

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,700
it was natural to rely on oil.
But the,

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,070
but that ended in 1970 when we became a
net wet.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,980
Well,
when our energy,

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,010
domestic energy production peaked and we
started relying on imports.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,570
So we have a problem that we're very
dependent on petroleum.

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,250
Now there are two problems with,
with our dependence on petroleum.

20
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,860
One of one is that we have to get it
from,

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,890
from foreign countries.
And that ties our foreign policy very

22
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,110
much to uh,
to,

23
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,540
to obtaining more and more oil from
other countries,

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,410
many of which are unfriendly or
dangerous or hostile.

25
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,860
And that has led to the militarization
of our foreign energy policy.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,490
I have spoken a little bit about that,
uh,

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,160
on one hand and there's a high cost
involved in that.

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,620
Also,
there's a very big economic cost in the

29
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:05,621
sense that we are exporting more and
more dollars to pay for imported oil.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,300
And those dollars that we spend our,
the maybe the,

31
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:17,301
the largest single factor in our balance
of payments deficit and that's

32
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,890
contributing to the weakening of the US
style or with respect to other

33
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,310
currencies,
which is contributing to the economic

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,380
slowdown we're seeing in this country.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,860
So our dependence on foreign oil is a
problem,

36
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,100
you know,
and the other side of the coin or the

37
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:39,101
other dimension of this is that oil,
like other fossil fuels produces carbon

38
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:43,820
dioxide.
And insofar as we continue to rely on

39
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:46,580
petroleum,
we're going to continue to emit carbon

40
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:51,581
dioxide into the atmosphere and we're
going to have a problem reducing our

41
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:56,360
greenhouse gas emissions.
So we have a double problem.

42
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,070
Now we want to cut back on carbon
dioxide emissions and we want to cut

43
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,660
back on our reliance on imported
petroleum.

44
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,650
And the only way to do that is to cut
back on our use of petroleum period.

45
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,130
And at this stage in the game,
we really have no plan in place to do

46
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,420
that.
And that's why I say,

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,460
uh,
all these efforts,

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
uh,
for energy independence that rely on

49
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,850
domestic sources of petroleum or a
dangerous delusion,

50
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,750
you know,
leading us to think there's a petroleum

51
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,180
solution.
There is no petroleum solution.

52
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,280
There's only non-petroleum sooner.
Ooh,

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,530
Shit.
