1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,050
Yeah,
I mean South Africa is a very

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,270
interesting case right now because I
think I'm

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,190
politically what's happening is in the
next couple and the next fortnight

4
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:22,191
actually a new African National Congress
president will be elected and whoever

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,590
becomes president of the ANC effective,
he becomes president of the country

6
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:29,940
because they get sort of 65 percent of
the vote in any national election.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,430
And the front runner at the moment is
this,

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,240
the Sky Jacob Zuma,
who was deputy president and then got

9
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:37,850
fired because he's,
um,

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,740
he was charged with both rape and
corruption.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,000
He got acquitted on the rape charge that
said the most horrific,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,340
um,
ms dot dennis stick things during the

13
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:52,110
trial and the corruption charges being
sort of put off and put off and put off

14
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,040
in these something,
you know,

15
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,120
some funny business going on there.
But the reason he is interesting is,

16
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:00,510
um,
he has massive popular support among

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,250
low,
low,

18
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,490
low class,
um,

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,510
South Africans who I think feel that,
you know,

20
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:11,511
it's been too long now since 94 and
they're not seeing the kind of practical

21
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,710
material changes in their lives and you
know,

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,090
houses running water,
electricity.

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,520
And so there's a kind of,
um,

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,790
radicalism that's sort of um,
being fostered at that level.

25
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:31,791
And for some reason Zuma has captured
the imagination of these people and he

26
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:38,781
is not being seen as the antidote to.
I'm the kind of politicians like in

27
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:44,520
Becky who's the current president or a
lot of the extremely wealthy,

28
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,130
um,
black businessmen like Tokyo,

29
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,680
six waller who's a,
basically a mining magnets.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,370
So I think it's a,
what's coming to hid non South Africa is

31
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:58,371
this thing of what happened is a lot of
the wealth was just sort of transferred

32
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:03,870
from this tranche of elite whites to
elite blacks and the people on the

33
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,720
ground.
So nothing changed in their lives.

34
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,310
And so there's a,
there's a kind of a backlash against

35
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:14,160
that.
And so it's playing out more along class

36
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:19,161
lines now than it is along race lines.
Racist still used as a galvanizing

37
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,360
factor politically.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,220
So,
um,

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,740
you know,
Zuma will often use whites as scapegoats

40
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:30,360
to sort of get people
riled up.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,820
But really it's an issue of,
um,

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,430
feeling like not enough has happened to
kind of

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,690
change the economics of the country in a
way that benefits ordinary South

44
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,690
Africans that makes him sound like I'm a
much better person than he is.

45
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,000
I mean,
I think this is one of the things that

46
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:55,890
worries me a lot at the moment.
It's like watching a train smash about

47
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:56,990
to happen.
Um,

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,380
and the,
the global community doesn't really seem

49
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:03,400
to see how terrible it would be if he
becomes president.

50
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,140
I mean,
there's nothing you can do,

51
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:09,610
but I think if he became president,
South Africa would go the way of

52
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,380
Zimbabwe within five to 10 years.
I think he would do a land grab.

53
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,620
I think he would have nationalized all
sorts of things.

54
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,690
But I think he's a leader who has
absolutely no.

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,720
Um,
no qualms about,

56
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,950
um,
you know,

57
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,130
doing what is best for him and um,
scared.

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,920
Hmm.
