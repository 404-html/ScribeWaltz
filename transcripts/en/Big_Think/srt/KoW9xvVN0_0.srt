1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,730
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,160
no,
I think we had to start from the fact,

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,680
you know,
somebody once said to me,

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,580
you're,
I didn't,

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,520
I didn't march in the sixties so that
men could sleep together.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,871
And I was like,
well,

7
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,730
you know,
that's the right mack is byard Rustin

8
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:23,990
had that held down like the man who
planned the march on Washington was,

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,820
was gay,
was known to be gay,

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,370
um,
and,

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,670
and that was okay with Dr King and it
was okay with Julian bond and John Lewis

12
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,504
then.
And it's,

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,420
it's okay now.
I mean,

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,820
I only regrets it,
but by residents,

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,680
they still isn't with us planning,
planning,

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,190
planning marches.
So I think we have to start from the

17
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:43,190
premise that gay people are part of the
NAACP.

18
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,040
Gay people are part of the social
justice movement that gay,

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,170
black people in particular,
um,

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,310
you know,
live both of those identities as we all

21
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:50,730
live,
you know,

22
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,710
multiple identities.

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,900
You know,
the,

24
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,990
the Naacp for that reason has always
been quick to recognize,

25
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,330
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,340
across a whole range of issues that are
common interests of black people as

27
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,640
black people,
you know,

28
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,570
or multiple identities as black people
and gay people as gay people.

29
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,230
There are multiple shades of colors.
I mean,

30
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,680
for instance,
issues of police brutality,

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,470
employment discrimination,
hate crimes.

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,680
We've been there side by side,
fighting on again and again.

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,090
Uh,
we set a big victory.

34
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,350
The Matthew Shepard,
James Byrd,

35
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:28,130
bill at the NAACP,
but ads in Texas to promote and really

36
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:31,910
to beat up on then governor about to
become President Bush for his lack of

37
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,060
support 10 years ago.
And we're out there now in the

38
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:39,710
employment nondiscrimination act and
we're out there now in Uganda.

39
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,940
No,
I mean we,

40
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,890
we,
we hate the definitely because it's the

41
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,270
death penalty,
but we also,

42
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,260
uh,
you know,

43
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,540
we hate it all the more when you say
that,

44
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,670
that,
that you want to make being a member of

45
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:52,160
a minority group,
any minority group,

46
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,890
the reason that you get the death
penalty and that's what they're trying

47
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:57,110
to do in Uganda,
they're trying to actually make being

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,540
gay,
uh,

49
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,410
a crime punishable by death.

50
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,630
The,
where there has been distanced recently

51
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:10,010
has been between religious communities
in general and the Movement for marriage

52
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:14,330
equality and the NAACP has a very
religious base and people who want to

53
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:17,030
see movement on that issue of people
wanting to feel like people want to see

54
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:20,920
more blacks in the Republican Party.
A need to invest in outreach,

55
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,370
need to really say,
you know,

56
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,110
what that constituency as a priority
and,

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,340
and I'm gonna,
you know,

58
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,310
make it my business to make sure that we
reach out to that consumer constituency

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,590
on their terms in the way that's most
effective.

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,170
That's what any good organizer does.
That's what I do for the issues that I'm

61
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,530
pushing the,
um,

62
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,860
with that said,
Julian Bond,

63
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:43,681
for instance,
our,

64
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,430
our,
our past chair is very outspoken in

65
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:47,600
support.
Um,

66
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,390
I've let it be known that I personally
support marriage equality.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,220
My brother,
the man who is closer to me than any man

68
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,340
on this planet,
uh,

69
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,220
my best friend since I was six years
old,

70
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,470
we started six months and,
and his mom celebrated mother's Day with

71
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,990
my mom and,
and his family lived with us off and on

72
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,250
for a third of my life.

73
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,560
Um,
is gay,

74
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,220
is HIV positive,
is a on again,

75
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,090
off again,
homeless.

76
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,790
I've,
I've spent many a lot of money trying to

77
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,380
keep them from being homeless,
but sometimes people just,

78
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,560
you know,
issues in their life that you,

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,700
that,
that no dollar can overcome.

80
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,270
Um,
so it's very personal for a lot of us I

81
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,720
guess is what I'm saying.
But we're a democratic organization at

82
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:36,070
the end of the day and that means that
we tend to be on the front edge of some

83
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,710
issues and we tend to lag behind on
others and we'd never get there until

84
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,780
consensus as bill.
And that's why I say to folks,

85
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:44,860
look,
if you'd want to see the naacp even more

86
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:47,280
active than we have been and we've been
active in California,

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,150
a folks there in California voted to
oppose prop eight and they,

88
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,560
and they rolled out all the stops to
oppose it.

89
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,030
The National Office signed onto the
lawsuit to invalidate probate because we

90
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:03,031
were able to get consensus on the
principle that I'm a simple majority

91
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:06,130
vote,
should not be able to trump a court's

92
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,070
finding of a fundamental right.
And that's a threat to whole range of

93
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,620
rights,
including the right to marry.

94
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,390
Um,
but also,

95
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:13,961
I mean,
you know,

96
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,980
the right to,
to,

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,090
to,
uh,

98
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,380
be treated with respect in the workplace
and not discriminate against in the

99
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,214
workplace.
For instance.

100
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,230
Apparently now it can be put up to a
vote in California.

101
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,680
So,
um,

102
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,311
you know,
we,

103
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,400
we have been involved,
you know,

104
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,950
gay people who have been involved in the
naacp for a long time.

105
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,550
The Naacp has been supportive abroad
civil human rights agenda in this

106
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,450
country,
including,

107
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,830
uh,
uh,

108
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,580
rights for gay and lesbian people for a
long time.

109
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,900
Um,
and,

110
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,140
and we have many,
many of our most outspoken leaders are,

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,690
are very outspoken on the issue of
marriage equality and many are outspoken

112
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,890
against it.
And,

113
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,060
uh,
like any other democratic organization

114
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,120
and trade union,
what,

115
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,530
what,
what have you,

116
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,860
it's being worked through.
And the way that one side wins or the

117
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:04,450
other is that they decide that,
that they want the membership of the

118
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,980
Naacp to be supportive of this one
particular part of the agenda more than

119
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,160
the other side does.
And,

120
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,730
and right now it seems to be a bit of a
tossup.
