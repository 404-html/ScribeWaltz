1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,440
I don't want to be an egg,
but it's,

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,320
it's doable.
I come from it and the language high

3
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:15,590
now.
Um,

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,960
but we have had the phenomenon in Europe
of feeding the nature.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,500
Now Nietzsche is well known for the
death of God,

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,180
nihilism and so on,
so forth

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,470
and net next to each year we had
Dostoyevsky,

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,530
uh,
brothers Karamazov the idiot,

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,220
a crime or punishment has also for now
those two,

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,190
um,
quite different figures,

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,080
uh,
had something in common and this and

12
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:49,580
that is that they realized,
they realized all too well that

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,870
MMM,

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,490
if we lose the idea or the awareness
that uh,

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,380
the most important things in life have
an intrinsic value,

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,623
okay,

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,140
then you will create,
then you will get nihilism.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,530
If we don't understand what freedom is
and we think that freedom is equal to

19
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:15,580
everything is permissible.
When everything's become permissible,

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,200
you get mass killing.
When things no longer half an intrinsic,

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,060
intrinsic value,
then you don't fail you or your child

22
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:28,810
because it is your child's,
but you fell you had because you think

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,520
he will become a movie star or football
player or we'll do a lot of work for me.

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,530
Uh,
you can no longer,

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,680
uh,
fell you decorate loft in your life

26
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,610
because you think,
well,

27
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,444
you know,
it would be,

28
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,130
you see,
I mean that's,

29
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:46,210
that's,
I mean it is the judge Gentek stupidity

30
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,860
of,
of,

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,330
of a society.
Um,

32
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,580
with this bombardments buy,
buy,

33
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,181
buy,
buy,

34
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,950
buy mass media,
which,

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,780
which is constantly lying to us.
It's constantly lying to us.

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,590
They,
they want to get first ID.

37
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,010
That's um,
Mr. Trump for example.

38
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:05,680
Mr. Trump is the incarnation of Mr
Kitsch.

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,930
And because you,
because he truly thinks that money is to

40
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,580
mode most important thing in alive.
And if you become a kitchen,

41
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:15,550
like figure like he is,
yes,

42
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,710
you can make a lot of money.
But look,

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,540
every sound can tell you that raise
nothing in money.

44
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,280
And this is what nihilism is.
That is absolutely nothing.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,640
So this is a,
what I called the kitchen society.

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,100
We aim at a presence.
We ignore the best.

47
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,420
We do not understand that the most
important things must have an intrinsic

48
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,310
value.
And,

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,370
um,
that was that there's,

50
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:49,840
something's has to,
has to be a sacred and that,

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,920
um,
uh,

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,000
on,
on the level of,

53
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,990
of,
of politics.

54
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,160
I mean,
look,

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,300
Mr Karl Rove when he was still there,
mission accomplished.

56
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,780
It's perfect example of what,
when,

57
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,400
when politics is no longer the real
debate about the good society,

58
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,820
when politics is reduced to,
you know,

59
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,570
Surfing Bart Interest or surfing a self
interest.

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,780
And to do it well,
we have to create a certain image like

61
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,670
mission accomplished.
I mean,

62
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,840
it worked for at least half a year that
the majority of the American people for

63
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,600
mission accomplished.
Now in the meantime,

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,340
they know the truth.
It's not there.

65
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,490
So when the Kitsch Society is there,
we are constantly upheld with the fact,

66
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,330
I mean,
again,

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,450
education and education should be pretty
useless.

68
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,750
Should focus on the useless,
should try to make us,

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,870
you know,
aware of,

70
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,690
uh,
what the masterpieces have to tell us,

71
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,960
how to gain a certain wisdom in life.
And then of course,

72
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,150
yes,
you have to develop your talents and you

73
00:03:55,151 --> 00:04:00,151
should follow your passion.
But for so long we are already living in

74
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:03,370
a society in which wisdom is replaced
by,

75
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,570
you know,
how in which a history,

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,240
according to Mr. Ford,
uh,

77
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:15,010
his bunk and all you have to do
religious sects who are telling you

78
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:18,030
there is only one truth and a 40 and you
have to obey and so on.

79
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,930
And so,
I mean,

80
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,020
are we surprised about what's happening
in our society?

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,960
Are we surprised about,
eh,

82
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,160
the sensors,
ness,

83
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,800
the killing or we,
and,

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,190
and,
and,

85
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,830
and,
and the interesting thing is that,

86
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,410
look,
we are still living in democracy.

87
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,050
It's not China,
it's not Russia,

88
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,180
it's not Darfur or both places.
We are still living in a democracy.

89
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,140
And for God's sake,
I mean,

90
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,210
you are American.
I mean,

91
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,070
this is the country we'd start with.
We,

92
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
the people now we the people means one
very simple thing that is we are

93
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,450
responsible,
we are responsible,

94
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,160
not those bullshit.
So if we stop watching television,

95
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,650
it will be immediately.
If you don't buy the product,

96
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,890
the product will be gone.
If you start by books,

97
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,630
bookshops,
we'll return.

98
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,590
Let's get rid of the lice.
That is,

99
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,330
I mean I,
I that's also,

100
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,760
I mean what I hope you can contribute
with this disease.

101
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,930
We have to get rid of the lies that I,
I'll be very powerful.

102
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,430
Now.
We are not very powerful.

103
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,640
And will it be addressed at chains?
Well,

104
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,500
what would change in our society if
people still can do what they want to do

105
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,710
but they can no longer keep up the
kitchen.

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
They can no longer keep up the ID.
Yes.

107
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,590
What I do is very important.
Therefore your interest or whatever,

108
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,740
we know you're lighting,
you still can do it,

109
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,220
but you're lying.
That would make a difference.

110
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,370
And so we need a different mindset.
We have to try to get back something,

111
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:52,771
you know,
of our,

112
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,050
our,
our,

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,410
our cultural setting and starting to
realize again,

114
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,190
what was the true questions are

115
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
democracy,

116
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,070
freedom,
love,

117
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,670
health,
all the good fix,

118
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,860
all the good things,
all the important things are that by

119
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:24,220
definition,
filterable at fragile,

120
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,100
nothing can be taken for probably,
again,

121
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,250
this is also European lesson.
Again,

122
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:38,251
my mother was in one of the camps.
It was impossible for her to throw away

123
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,100
one single piece of breads because she
knew what hunger was.

124
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,150
That generation knows very,
very well still what freedom is and what

125
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,900
happens to society when there is no
longer freedom.

126
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,200
They know what they are talking about.
And they also know it's never a Giffen.

127
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,680
We don't have guarantees not alive,
not for our society.

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,150
So we know and we can even see it on
television.

129
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,210
And if you also see,
uh,

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,970
by what kind of forces we are
surrounded.

131
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,370
Yes,
that is terrorism.

132
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,580
Yes,
there are people with a complete

133
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:21,610
different mindset who believe in a kind
of holy law.

134
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,990
And so almost a fourth who want to
define it,

135
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
reduce the world to believe snow.
Unbelievers and everybody in their

136
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,820
mindset is an unbelief.
It should be an eagle lated and killed

137
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,130
and so on and so forth.
And yes,

138
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,250
it is there.
And yes,

139
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,370
there are,
uh,

140
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,350
people,
uh,

141
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,380
with economic power and so crazy by
their economic commercial power that he

142
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:47,350
really wants to reduce everybody to
consumers.

143
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,390
And if I'm,
you know,

144
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:54,220
turn our society into a kind of
infantiles society that we all behave

145
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:58,590
like stupid childs who wants this or
that and,

146
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:01,330
and,
and can fight a certain satisfaction.

147
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,040
Now for,
for a long moment,

148
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,680
we know the forces high there.
We know that the best thing can Paris

149
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,910
very,
very easily.

150
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,160
So,
um,

151
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,640
being that the case and realizing that
what all those forces in their role for

152
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:21,790
variety,
so what's a Sarepta and some are more

153
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,920
immediately frightening to our society
and orders are more threatening in,

154
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,800
in a longterm.

155
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,210
But what they have in common is that
they take away the quality of our life,

156
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,540
which could be on the level of the
environment,

157
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,630
which could be on the level of,
of our civil society,

158
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,740
which could be on,
on,

159
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:39,371
on,
on,

160
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:40,460
on,
on one folf.

161
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,790
But they take away the quality of our
life,

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,790
the ferry first thing to be done
immediately.

163
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,260
You know,
breaking news,

164
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,530
let's do it right now,
is we have to rethink what is,

165
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,520
what's the meaning of the good society.
And,

166
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,570
um,
as I once said to a friends,

167
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,210
and not that long ago,
I finally had the opportunity to go to

168
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,490
Ellis island for the,
for the very first time,

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,040
a statue of liberty then to Ellis
island.

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,810
I'm a European,
right?

171
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,750
I'm not an American.
I'm fascinated by your history.

172
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm fascinated by the people who came.
So I came to Ellis Island,

173
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,610
I saw this documentary with Gene
Hackman.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,930
And you understand,
knowing the history of Europe,

175
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,950
that uh,
for so many people,

176
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,040
America by definition is if it's not the
good society,

177
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,970
it's the better society because the
horror they had to face in Europe.

178
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,030
One guy's in this documentary says an
old man,

179
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,230
he says,
uh,

180
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,760
the strange thing about America is that
the police is here to help you.

181
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,420
They're also not the case in Russia.
That was not the case in Poland.

182
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:49,500
That was not the case in France.
So I understand the kind of mindset in

183
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,290
which Americans think,
well,

184
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,380
maybe it's not the good society or the
best societies,

185
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,290
but by far the better society,
the time itself,

186
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,630
everybody now has to rethink once the
good society,

187
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,440
what are the quintessential values?
What is it that Europe and America have

188
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,940
in common?
And how to defend those values in such a

189
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:15,270
way that you are not a threat to the
rest of the world.

190
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,800
But I mean the American dream worked
because everybody could realize,

191
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,330
hey,
there's something in it for me

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,300
now,
the best,

193
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,610
uh,
creators,

194
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:30,611
the situation with it's globalization,
with globalization in a sense of that,

195
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,760
that,
that a lot of people have half the idea

196
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,280
that,
that around identities are destructed

197
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,850
because I don't want to sound like an
anti American but have the only coca

198
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:46,590
cola and only a Mcdonald's.
And so,

199
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,900
I mean that's the caricature,
but that's how a lot of people

200
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:50,970
experience it.
Um,

201
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,840
that's not the way that,
and that's also not the as essence of

202
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,140
the American dream.
So the good society,

203
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,590
what our quintessential fellows,
and then from there on,

204
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,730
what is it that we are doing with our
education?

205
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
How do we use,
how a media,

206
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:05,581
I mean,
our media,

207
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,620
I no longer to,
to give information.

208
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,550
I mean,
far from it.

209
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,100
It's,
it's just one big commercial,

210
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,160
a,
a thing as education has become a

211
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:16,720
commercial,
uh,

212
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,880
thing.
Um,

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,900
look at,
uh,

214
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,310
look at the politics.
I mean,

215
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,080
it's,
it's on the both sides,

216
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,210
on both,
on the liberal side and the conservator,

217
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,130
there was an enormous reductionism to
very simplistic concepts,

218
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,440
which has nothing to do with a serious
discussion.

219
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,440
So there's a lot of work to be done,
but,

220
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:34,940
you know,
we,

221
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,060
we,
we can do it.

222
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,280
And also we should win because we don't
have a choice.
