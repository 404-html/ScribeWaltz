1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,370
So the second grade on truth always
trust your feelings.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,990
The wisdom traditions of the entire
world say don't do that.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,020
For example,
some of the quotes we have in the book,

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,160
uh,
from Shakespeare,

5
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:21,120
there's nothing good or bad,
but thinking makes it so from Marcus

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,130
Aurelius,
the whole world has changed and life

7
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,750
itself is,
but what you deem it,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,100
uh,
from Buddha,

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,260
our thoughts are the creations of our
minds.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,760
With our minds.
We make the world.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,450
CBT is just a way of teaching people
skills to do exactly that,

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,610
to question their feelings,
to look for evidence.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,640
Uh,
so in CBT you learn the names of these

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,680
distortions,
about 15 or so distortions.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,470
You can guess what they mean.
Catastrophizing,

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,020
black and white thinking,
labeling,

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,080
mind reading.
These are the things that depressed and

18
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:56,160
anxious people do a lot.
One way to sort of keep all of us have

19
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:57,240
had experiences of these.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,450
One thing I like to think about as homer
Simpson saying,

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,330
shut up brain or I'll stab you with a
qtip.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,720
Our brains do this.
Our brains go on and on.

23
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:06,720
But like stop it,
stop it,

24
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,680
stop it.
Well,

25
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,640
CBT is a way of stopping it.
It's so easy to learn.

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,010
Many people,
including me,

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,470
learned it from a wonderful book by
David Burns called feeling good.

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,760
Um,
in our book,

29
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,940
we and on our webpage,
if you go to the coddling.org,

30
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,970
uh,
we have suggestions for books and apps

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,050
where you can learn it.
Cognitive behavioral therapy is not more

32
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:30,270
effective than several other treatments.
There are.

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,370
Most treatments are about equally
effective,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,480
but it's so easy to learn if you teach,
and I've done this in my classes,

35
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,150
if you assign everyone in the class to
learn CBT,

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,610
most people get it and get something out
of it.

37
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,540
Other techniques like meditation work,
but they're harder.

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,780
Most people drop off.
So cbt is easy,

39
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,410
really well tested,
has a huge impact on a variety of mental

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,230
health and mental illnesses,
especially those related to depression

41
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,890
and anxiety.
We think every college student and heck,

42
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:03,630
every high school student should be
taught these basic skills given how high

43
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,820
the rates of anxiety and depression are
today.

44
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,320
So for the last few years we've been
hearing reports that counseling centers

45
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,470
on campus or overwhelmed.
We're hearing stories about rising

46
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,680
depression and anxiety.
Some people say,

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,660
oh,
it's nothing to be alarmed about.

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,270
It's not real.
It's just that young people today,

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,730
they're so comfortable talking about
mental illness,

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,250
they're more open about it,
and that's why the rates seem to be

51
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,650
rising.
Sounds plausible.

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,290
Not True.
It's not just that young people are more

53
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,350
comfortable.
We know this because studies have been

54
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:38,670
done looking at hospital admission data
who is being admitted to hospitals

55
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:41,430
because they cut themselves,
they took poison,

56
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,380
they harmed themselves in some other
way.

57
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,570
We see exactly the same curves,
uh,

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,120
on that date in particular,
boys are not changing,

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,130
but girls are going way,
way up.

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,800
Only teenage girls,
not millennials,

61
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,801
not kids born before 1995 but kids born
in 1995 and after the girls in

62
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,240
particular are cutting themselves and
being admitted to hospitals and much

63
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,370
higher rates.
Most alarmingly,

64
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,400
the suicide rate,
if you look at the last couple of years,

65
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,710
compared to the first 10 years of the
century,

66
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,720
the suicide rate for American boys,
teenage boys is up 25%,

67
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:17,560
which is a gigantic increase.
The suicide rate for American girls is

68
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,040
up to 70%.
So something is going wrong.

69
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,680
Something is affecting American
teenagers,

70
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,450
especially girls.
Uh,

71
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,180
so in the United States right now is
many people have noticed,

72
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,830
uh,
we are,

73
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,350
uh,
we are seeing a huge escalation of our

74
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,110
long running culture war.
Unfortunately,

75
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,150
universities are right in the heart of
that.

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,390
The right loves to come in and say,
Hey,

77
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,300
the university is our bastions of
political correctness.

78
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:46,570
They've lost their minds.
The left is motivated to say,

79
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,250
no,
there's no not a problem.

80
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,280
There's nothing going on.
It's just that the right hates ideas.

81
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:55,180
They hate universities.
So the way that this whole book started

82
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,940
is that Greg Lukey on,
off my coauthor and friend,

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,810
um,
is prone to depression and he had a

84
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:06,811
suicidal depression in 2007.
He was hospitalized and he learned

85
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,900
cognitive behavioral therapy as part of
his treatment and he credits it with

86
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,220
saving his life.
Um,

87
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,580
so he goes back to his job as the
president of the foundation for

88
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,450
individual rights and education.
He's been fighting for free speech

89
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,210
rights for students,
pushing back against administrators who

90
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,710
are always imposing speech limits.
Students were always his best

91
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,470
supporters.
Students generally wanted the rights to

92
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,760
speak and think and,
and,

93
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,750
and be independent.

94
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,650
Until 2013 beginning of the fall of 2013
he started seeing the first cases of

95
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,660
students saying,
we want protections from words,

96
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:41,620
books,
ideas,

97
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,810
speakers.
We want speakers.

98
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:46,060
Disinvited don't let this person onto
our campus.

99
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,920
Not because it will be offensive,
but because it will be dangerous.

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,590
It will be harmful.
It will be traumatizing.

101
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,540
We want trigger warnings if you're going
to assign a book that has violence in

102
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,890
it,
especially sexual violence,

103
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,660
like a Greek myth,
which has rape,

104
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,260
if you're going to sign that,
you need to warn students against it.

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,030
Um,
so that they can choose whether they

106
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:11,080
want to absent themselves on that day.
So this was something new.

107
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,720
And at first it was just a strange thing
at a few schools.

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,650
And then over the following year,
it built to the point where in 2014 we

109
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,190
started reading articles in the new
republic and the New York Times about

110
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,590
trigger warnings,
safe spaces,

111
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,570
microaggression,
training,

112
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,130
bias response teams.

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,510
A whole set of constructs and procedures
emerged on certain universities,

114
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,880
not everywhere,
but especially at elite schools in the

115
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:38,530
northeast and on the west coast.
A way of protecting students from words,

116
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:39,071
books,
ideas,

117
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,010
and speakers.
Speakers were shouted down increasingly

118
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,460
not because they were offensive and
hateful because they were dangerous.

119
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,750
For students to think about ideas in
terms of right or wrong is great,

120
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,520
exciting versus boring is great,
but safe versus dangerous.

121
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,830
This is a terrible way to approach the
world.

122
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,113
So,
uh,

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,260
Greg came to talk to me because what he
saw with students doing the exact

124
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:07,640
cognitive distortions that he had
learned to stop doing when he was

125
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,400
treated for cognitive behavioral therapy
when he's treated for depression,

126
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,750
greg was concerned that if students are
beginning to think this way about safety

127
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,990
and danger and harmfulness,
that this is gonna make them depressed

128
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,824
and anxious.

129
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,090
And that's what led us to write our
original article in the,

130
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,280
in the Atlantic in 2015 titled the
coddling of the American mind.

131
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,810
Um,
we published the article in 2015 before

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,560
a big wave of student protests in around
Halloween of 2015.

133
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,010
So these,
these trends that we saw that greg and I

134
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:42,011
both saw hints of in 2014,
they exploded in the fall of 2015.

135
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,110
Uh,
they've spread much more widely in the

136
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,960
couple of years since then.
And at the same time we're seeing rates

137
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:51,050
of depression and anxiety increasing
rapidly too.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,510
We're not saying these are causing that,
we don't know,

139
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,730
but there is a national wave of
depression.

140
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,850
Students are thinking in terms of safety
and danger.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,420
Students say by their own admission they
are more fragile.

142
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,180
They use a language of fragility,
weakness,

143
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,690
trauma triggering.
They see triggers all over the world.

144
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,620
What are triggers?
Triggers are cases where you take a part

145
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,220
of your nervous system and you say,
if someone says that word,

146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,790
they can control my nervous system and
make me afraid and anxious.

147
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,890
That's a terrible idea.
We should not be teaching our kids to,

148
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,370
to see the world as being full of
triggers.

149
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,330
We should teach them to live in a world
that is physically quite safe,

150
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,640
but full of offensive statements and
ideas,

151
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,690
especially on the Internet.
A sad commentary on the state of a,

152
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,170
of the business world now is that Google
is being sued from both sides,

153
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,620
from women who say that they're a
victims of a hostile climate and from

154
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,280
conservatives and white men who say that
conserves and white men are

155
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,380
discriminated against.
So in our current era,

156
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,080
everybody feels they're a victim.
Um,

157
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,110
the truth is that diversity of
perspectives is essential for healthy

158
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,370
organizations,
especially those who care about

159
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,490
innovation.
We have to address all of the diversity

160
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,170
issues.
At the same time.

161
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,650
We can't pit them against each other.
We have to work on our speech climate,

162
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,840
uh,
in the business world is called speak up

163
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:09,820
culture.
Uh,

164
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,400
in the academic world,
it's called just basic openness to

165
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,430
ideas.
We're having problems all across

166
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,350
American society.
We've got to work on them.
