1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,280
The question isn't about whether dark
matter exists or not.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,440
What's going on is when we measure
gravity in the universe that the

3
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:19,810
collective gravity of the stars,
the planets,

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,250
the moons,
the gas clouds,

5
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:25,420
the black holes,
the whole galaxies.

6
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:30,421
When we do this,
85% has no known origin.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,690
So it's not a matter of whether dark
matter exists or not.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,060
It's a measurement period.
Now,

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,070
dark matter is not even what we should
be calling it cause that implies that

10
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:50,620
it's matter.
It implies we know something about it

11
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:55,621
that we actually don't.
So a more precise labeling for it would

12
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:01,600
be dark gravity.
Now if I call the dark gravity,

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,610
are you going to say,
does dark gravity really exists?

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,810
I say,
yeah,

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,980
it's 85% of the gravity has no known
origin.

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,390
There it is.
Let's figure out what's causing it.

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,640
The fact that the word matter got into
that word is forcing people to,

18
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,230
I have another idea.
I bet it's not matter.

19
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:25,231
It could be something else.
We're overreacting to a label that

20
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,970
overstates are actual insights or
knowledge into what it is we're

21
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:36,010
describing.
Then I just joke,

22
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:39,640
we should just call it fred,
fred or Wilma,

23
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,790
something where there is no reference to
what we think it is because in fact we

24
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,744
have no idea.

25
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,620
So here's how you actually measure this
stuff.

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,320
Uh,
in a galaxy,

27
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:58,270
which was the smallest aggregation of
matter where dark matter manifests.

28
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,390
So you look how fast it's rotating and
we know from laws of gravity first laid

29
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:06,590
down by Johann is Kepler,
and then modify,

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,670
then enhanced and given further detail
in deeper understanding by Isaac Newton.

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,110
You write down these equations,
say,

32
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,460
Oh,
look how fast it's rotating.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,720
Invoke that rotation rate in the
equation and out the other side says how

34
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:24,880
much gravity,
how much mass should be they're

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,580
attracting you.
And the more mass that's there,

36
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:31,630
the faster we expect you to be orbiting.
That kind of makes sense.

37
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,010
So when you do this calculation on a
galactic scale,

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,640
we get vastly more mass attracting you.
Then we actually can detect,

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,790
I'm adding up the stars,
gas clouds,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,760
moons planets,
black holes,

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,310
add it all up.
It's a fraction of what we know is

42
00:02:55,151 --> 00:03:00,151
attracting you in this orbit.
And we cannot detect the rest and so we

43
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:07,201
handed this title dark matter,
understandably I suppose,

44
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,280
but it implies that we know that it's
matter but we don't,

45
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,540
we know we can't detect it in any known
way

46
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,150
and we know it has gravity so it really
should be called dark gravity.

47
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,030
I think the over under on what dark
matter might be today.

48
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:34,031
I think we're all kind of leaning
towards a family of particles,

49
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,450
subatomic particles that have hardly any
ability to interact with the particles

50
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:49,700
we have come to know and love quote
ordinary matter and that would make it

51
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:52,790
matter dark matter as we've all been
describing it

52
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,900
and it's not a weird thing that you
could have a particle that doesn't

53
00:03:56,901 --> 00:04:01,370
interact with our particles within our
own family of particles.

54
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,540
There are examples where the interaction
is very weak or nonexistence you

55
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:11,120
might've heard of neutrinos.
This is a ghost like particle that

56
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:16,121
permeates the universe and hardly
interacts with familiar matter at all.

57
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,140
Yet it is part of our family of
particles that we know exist and that we

58
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:24,350
can detect and interact with.

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,700
So if that can,
if we can have an elusive particle

60
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,460
that's part of our own familiar family
of particles,

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,230
it's not much of a stretch to think of a
whole other category of particles were.

62
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:40,340
None of them give a rat's ass about the
rest of us and they just pass right

63
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,050
through us as though we're not even
there.

64
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,320
Now here's what's interesting about dark
matter.

65
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,740
We know it doesn't interact with us
except the gravitational.

66
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,060
And by the way,
what do I mean by interact?

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,170
Does it bind and make atoms and
molecules and solid objects?

68
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,340
No,
it does not interact with us in any

69
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,720
important known way,
but it also doesn't interact with

70
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:08,720
itself.
That's what's interesting.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,680
So if it interacted with itself,
you could imagine finding dark matter

72
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,930
planets,
dark matter galaxies.

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,090
Because to interact with yourself is
what allows you to accumulate and have a

74
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:26,360
concentration of matter in one place
versus another.

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,390
These are the atomic bonds and the
molecular bonds that creates solid

76
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:37,391
objects.
And if particles do not interact with

77
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,890
one another,
they just pass through.

78
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,100
You just have this zone of mass,
not really doing anything interesting.

79
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,660
So dark matter not only doesn't interact
with us,

80
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,980
it doesn't interact with itself and
that's why when we find dark matter

81
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,250
across the universe is very diffusely
spread out.

82
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,180
It's,
it's like over here,

83
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,810
it's not in this one spot and look at
this concentration.

84
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,000
No,
that's not how that works.

85
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,510
An example of this,
you know what is a rock?

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,900
It's an,
it's a collection of atoms and molecules

87
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,310
that are stuck together by
electromagnetic forces.

88
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:28,100
We don't think of them that way.
We just think of them as rocks,

89
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,700
but they are held together by forces on
the atomic and molecular scale and they

90
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:40,160
bind together and then we get what we
call the solid object called a rock.

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,030
If those forces did not work on you as a
particle,

92
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,930
you have no occasion to bind with any
other particle.

93
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,570
You have no occasion.
You have no ambitions of ever becoming a

94
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:58,571
solid object
to different kind of world.

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,700
That would be,
we would not expect that world to have

96
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:09,701
life as we know it because life requires
and assembly of molecules to turn it

97
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,700
into some separate entity,
distinct from everything else.

98
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,810
That then has fascinating chemical
properties that we call life.
