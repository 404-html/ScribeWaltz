1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,840
I think the most important thing
then I have learned

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,240
is it,
there's more to learn

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,930
that we should,

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,563
that we,

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,860
that we should all be hungry for a
lifetime.

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,120
I mean,
for example,

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
at my next birthday I'll be 68 all the
great scientific discoveries made by all

8
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:46,370
the great geniuses were largely made
when they were in their twenties and

9
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,370
thirties
and yet I became about two years ago,

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,760
obsessed with particle physics
and I was determined to understand it

11
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:06,071
before I died.
I could not have done that if I hadn't

12
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:12,241
learned to read when I was young,
if I hadn't had the opportunity to study

13
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:19,600
science courses in my high school.
And I lived in the second poorest state

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,580
in the United States,
which most people my age and my state

15
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:28,150
did not have.
I happened to go to a bigger high school

16
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,530
with people who

17
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,250
understood we had to get good science
and math teachers there.

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,430
And if I hadn't gone to,
in my case,

19
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,910
Georgetown University,
which was a jesuit university and I

20
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:46,911
hadn't been subject to the kind of
rigors that the jesuits impose,

21
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,420
which made me realize that however much
I thought I knew and how real smart I

22
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,820
was,
I didn't know very much and I wasn't

23
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,350
very smart.
I had a lot to deliver.

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,860
So that's the most important thing.
I learned that your brain is a gift and

25
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:05,871
we now know that people well into their
late sixties and seventies can form new

26
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:11,091
neural networks so that even though your
brain begins to shrink and your thirties

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,460
and does throughout your life stance,
none of us ever use even close to half

28
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:21,000
of our brainpower.
We got a lot left and we will in our

29
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,850
light on our last day on earth,
we'll have a lot left.

30
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,990
So the idea that we now know as a
scientific measure because of all the

31
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:35,511
brain scanning technology that we can
form these networks and that we formed

32
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:40,860
them best were most likely to form new
neural networks later in life by

33
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:45,861
learning something new.
So if I said I was interested in

34
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:51,150
particle physics and also in
astrophysics and I'm trying to figure

35
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:56,151
out what it means that we've located 20
planets outside our solar system in the

36
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,340
last five years,
it seemed to have enough density and be

37
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,390
far enough away from their sons that
they might be able to support life.

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,290
That may be the answer to the Russia
Ukraine problem and attack from out an

39
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,070
attack from outer space.
We'll immediately unite us.

40
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:17,071
All
members of Congress in the U s will

41
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,160
immediately start hugging each other and
singing Kumbaya.

42
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,640
But anyway,
I can form new neural networks doing

43
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,060
that cause I don't know anything about
it or I did and when I started,

44
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,630
a theoretical physicist would do better
going to Suzuki piano lessons with his

45
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:43,141
grandchild or her grandchild and just
playing if you knew nothing about music.

46
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,090
But this is an incredible thing that the
most important thing I learned is that

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,120
it's important to keep on learning that
you should stay hungry and that their

48
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:58,870
greatest gift can be even as your body
begins to fail.

49
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,390
If your mind is still working,
you need to use it

50
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,050
[inaudible].
