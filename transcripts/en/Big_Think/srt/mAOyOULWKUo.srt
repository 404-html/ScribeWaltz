1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,170
The digital economy is breaking things
because most people running digital

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:16,311
companies aren't aware of the operating
system that's beneath what they're

3
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,640
doing.
You know,

4
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:24,120
there's a good old fashion,
uh,

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,420
venture capital driven operating system.
You know,

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,760
it's,
it goes back to central currency and

7
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:37,440
corporatism and chartered monopolies and
really the way our economy works,

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,300
which has worked for a good four or 500
years and promoted everything from the

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,290
British east India trading company right
through the Walmart and General

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,070
Electric.
But when you take that and juice it up

11
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,730
with digital steroids,
weird things start to happen.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,600
You know,
you end up able to tweak and optimize

13
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:02,601
your business so carefully that you can
really see is it growing,

14
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,190
is it not growing?
What can we do to promote growth,

15
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,030
growth,
growth.

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,040
And if your company's not growing,
you end up in big trouble against all

17
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,900
the other players that are growing.

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,230
No,
it's simple a power law dynamics.

19
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,240
It's a winner.
Takes all landscape.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,390
So if you have a company like twitter,
which I would see in my old fashioned

21
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:29,061
view as a successful company,
it makes $500 million a quarter based on

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,490
140 character APP success,
right?

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,250
No.
In the current environment,

24
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:39,150
that's a failure because they don't have
a growth strategy.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,970
They don't know how to turn into a video
company,

26
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:46,380
a news company as social company than
everything company.

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,740
And the reason why the digital economy
is breaking our businesses is because

28
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:57,171
we're taking the old agenda of growth
and running it on digital platforms and

29
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:03,021
it ends up amplifying and spinning this
priority out of control.

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,020
Most of us look at the industrial age as
this natural outgrowth of the need to do

31
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,740
more and better business.
But as I researched it,

32
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:18,090
I found out that most of the innovations
we came up with in the industrial age

33
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:23,091
where really for the opposite,
there was a thriving peer to peer

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,400
economy right at the end of the Middle
Ages that nobody likes to talk about.

35
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,890
The soldiers had come back from the
Crusades.

36
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:36,000
They had all sorts of new inventions and
technologies and mechanisms.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,720
They were new trade routes that they had
opened up and they came back to their

38
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,080
towns and they took something that they
found in the Middle East called the

39
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:47,670
bizarre and they revived it as something
they called the marketplace.

40
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,740
So now people who had just been peasants
working on the land of the Lords started

41
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:55,440
coming together and trading the stuff
that they made.

42
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,620
And they had all of these really
interesting instruments from market and

43
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:04,621
local currency and grain based currency.
And all of these evolved really to

44
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,991
promote the exchange of value when the
velocity of transactions between people

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,750
and it started to really do well,
which was the problem.

46
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,440
As the peasants became wealthy,
the aristocracy got scared.

47
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,290
Who are these people?
They're not going to be dependent on us

48
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,040
anymore.

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,040
So they came up with two main financial
innovations to prevent the rise of this

50
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,260
peer to peer economy.
The first one was the chartered

51
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:31,540
monopoly.
Really the parent to the modern

52
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,210
corporation,
all the chartered monopoly was,

53
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,110
was a way to say all of you small
businesses are now illegal.

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,910
If you want to be in the shoe business,
you have to work for His Majesty's Royal

55
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,500
Shoe Company.
You want to be in the grain business,

56
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,200
you'll have to work for His Majesty's
Royal Grain Company.

57
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,410
So people who were small business people
now became employees instead of selling

58
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,980
the value they created.
Now they sold their time as servants,

59
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,580
as wage laborers.
The second invention they came up with

60
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,390
was central currency,
not such a terrible thing in itself.

61
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,740
It's great to have a long distance
currency that lots of people can use and

62
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,860
value.
But the problem was they made all of the

63
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,600
local currencies illegal.

64
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,180
So the only way people could trade with
each other,

65
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,880
the candlestick maker could trade with
the chicken farmer,

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,900
was by borrowing central currency from
the treasury.

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,160
So now you had to borrow money at
interest just in order to transact.

68
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,060
And that set in motion,
really a growth cascade.

69
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,270
If you have a currency that has to be
paid back with interest in order to just

70
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,370
to meet,
to make ends meet,

71
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,330
you need an economy that's growing.
You need more money next year.

72
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:50,050
Then there was this year.
So that worked well for colonial powers.

73
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,670
As long as we can extend into Africa and
South America and North America,

74
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,060
find slaves,
find new resources we could grow.

75
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,900
But what happens when you reach the end
of the planet's growth as we did really

76
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,620
at the end of World War II?
Well then we started to look for really

77
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:10,000
virtual surface area,
some new way to grow and that was

78
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:10,834
technology.

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,310
We believed that digital technology in
the worldwide web and computers would

80
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:20,140
really create a new place,
a new virtual territory for us to

81
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,660
colonize.
And it just turns out what we've been

82
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:26,890
colonizing for the last 20 years is
human attention and human time.

83
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,230
And now it looks like we're even running
out of that.

84
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,470
Or when the Internet first emerged,
people like me thought,

85
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:36,400
Hooray.
Now we're going to have a way to restore

86
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,430
all that peer to peer connectivity
between people.

87
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,550
And some of the earliest,
uh,

88
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,540
Internet businesses actually sought to
do that in one way or another.

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,750
If you look at the path of Ebay and
paypal and etsy and square,

90
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,000
there aren't a lot.
There are a lot of businesses that are

91
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,250
looking at how can we connect people in
a lateral way.

92
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,730
Problem is as those businesses grew and
everybody got interested in the net,

93
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,480
other folks,
the folks who really who,

94
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:11,390
who started wired magazine or the global
business network,

95
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,900
a lot of folks who were from the old
Nasdaq Stock Exchange,

96
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,280
which had been really depleted ever
since the uh,

97
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
biotech crash of 1987 they saw in the
Internet a new avenue for growth.

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,580
So for them it wasn't about how are we
going to connect people in new wonderful

99
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,990
ways and let them,
uh,

100
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,780
uh,
create an exchange value between them.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,850
It was really more how can we use
digital platforms to extract value from

102
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,970
people in places.
So if you compare an Ebay,

103
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,910
which is promoting exchange to an
Amazon,

104
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:47,480
which is promoting extraction,
you can kind of begin to see the

105
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,650
difference.
What happens is you end up with digital

106
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:56,651
businesses that really are started more
in the flip this house model of

107
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,980
business.
Then I'm going to start a business that

108
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,800
helps people and keeps going for 20
years.

109
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,930
People put money into an internet
business in order to get to acquisition

110
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:11,270
or IPO.
They want to grow this business a

111
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,990
hundred times and then get out.
It's called an exit strategy.

112
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,850
Then it doesn't matter what happens.
So if you have a ride sharing company,

113
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,320
are you going to pay your drivers enough
so that they can have an ecosystem that

114
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,520
lasts 20 years?

115
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,440
No,
you don't care about that.

116
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,030
You can adopt a scorched earth policy
towards this because you only need those

117
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:36,380
drivers and that whole ride sharing
sector long enough to establish a

118
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:39,410
monopoly and then move over into
something else.

119
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,710
When the Internet came around,
we all thought we're all going to get to

120
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,960
work at home in our underwear,
in our own time,

121
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,190
exchanging value with one another,
but instead we've ended up with an

122
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:53,750
internet that takes more time from us,
an Internet that we feel exhausted and

123
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:58,070
drained when we're done using it,
and that's because we're not using it.

124
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,200
It's using us.
These.

125
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,230
The Internet is really just the
technological front on a whole series of

126
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,050
business plans that are looking to
extract money from us,

127
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,760
time from us,
attention from us,

128
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,830
and if we have none of those things,
at least data from us and we're not

129
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:19,130
feeling it creating value for us,
we're not feeling,

130
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,570
it really enhanced our ability to create
an exchange value with other people.

131
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,860
It's harder for most of us to make a
living now rather than easier,

132
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,790
and that's not because automation is
doing things better.

133
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,890
It's because we're really facing very
extractive business plans,

134
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,310
extensions of that very same late
medieval squashing of peer to peer

135
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,980
activity,
although now amplified in every device

136
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:50,981
in our arsenal.
The reason I'm optimistic is because the

137
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:56,921
metrics are all on the side doing
business well rather than this scorched

138
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,290
earth,
short term extractive model that most

139
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,380
digital companies use.
If you look at the data,

140
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,480
family businesses do better than
shareholder owned businesses on every

141
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:13,110
single metric except one.
They grow slower during bubbles.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,030
And actually you kind of want to want to
grow slower during bubbles because if

143
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,370
you grow big during a bubble,
then you're part of what pops.

144
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,380
Now,
the reason why family businesses do

145
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:27,090
better in the long run than shareholder
owned businesses is because the person

146
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,330
running a share,
uh,

147
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,190
the person running a family business
wants it to be around in another

148
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,900
generation or two or three.

149
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,400
The person running a shareholder owned
business wants to extract enough money

150
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,200
from that business so their grandchild
can be given this wad of cash.

151
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,460
The person with a family business wants
the business to be healthy enough so the

152
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,970
grandchild can then run a successful
thriving business.

153
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,790
And because your family name is on the
business,

154
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,050
you don't want to do really mean things
to your employees or do the places where

155
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,050
you operate because then people are
going to hate your family.

156
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,160
You know,
it's your name,

157
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,110
it's your face.
So a very,

158
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,540
uh,
a very different dynamic gets set up in

159
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,320
one that's ultimately more sustainable
as a business.

160
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,470
You know,
and startup founders of startups and

161
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,040
technology businesses have to come to
understand that taking venture capital

162
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,520
and going for the big acquisition,
going for that one out of 10,000 chance

163
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,920
of getting a home run is dumb compared
to taking a very small amount of money

164
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,860
and hitting the single or the double.

165
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,720
In other words,
making 10 or $20 million is not tragic.

166
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,090
It's still enough.
You can still really,

167
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,090
you'll going to get by on that.
You're going to be able to send your

168
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:53,091
kids to great colleges.
It's not a failure to have millions of

169
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,880
dollars,
but if you have to aim for the billions,

170
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:00,900
if you are forced to,
your probability is so low.

171
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,220
You know when I look at these founders
running to sequoia and flat iron and y

172
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,870
combinator cause they want to go big and
get the home run,

173
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,310
it looks to me like those people you see
taking their welfare checks and going to

174
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:18,930
the Bodega and buying lottery tickets
because they want to get the jackpot.

175
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,680
The 43 million,
they have no chance of doing that and

176
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,000
they would have a chance of taking their
five or $10 and actually investing it

177
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,310
and buy a book,
learn how to do something,

178
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,144
get a job.

179
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,210
They have a much more high probability
of succeeding and it just breaks my

180
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:40,200
heart when I see a kid have a great app,
a great idea,

181
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,850
and then they turn to a venture
capitalist who gives them a ton of money

182
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,960
in a high valuation and then has them
pivot.

183
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,040
The pivot is not to do something better.
All a pivot means is you're going to

184
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:00,700
abandon what your original business was
in order to come up with something

185
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,270
that's sellable to the next round of
investors,

186
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,010
the next ground of suckers.
Really,

187
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,950
and do you really want to throw away
your business?

188
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,951
Do you really want to dispose of your
idea in order to turn it into the the

189
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,920
brand name on a Ponzi scheme?
You know,

190
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,820
I hope not because there's still so many
great things we can do with these

191
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,520
technologies.
There's so much money to be made.

192
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,510
There's so much,
there's so much revenue in creating

193
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:31,900
people to one another and helping people
create an exchange value.

194
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,050
You know,
the mantra I would give any startup and

195
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:38,260
any big business is make other people
rich.

196
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,710
If you make your users rich,
they will come back.

197
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,950
If you make them poor,
you've killed your marketplace.
