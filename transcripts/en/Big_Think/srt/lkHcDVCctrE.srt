1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,100
Aesthetic evolution,
animals are agents in their own

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,860
evolution.
That is it through their choices,

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,040
they ended up shaping their own species.
One of the implications of this idea is

4
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:24,591
a new perspective on what happens when
mate choice is infringed or violated by

5
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,400
sexual violence or by a coercion in,
uh,

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,600
in animal species.
Uh,

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,650
one prominent example of this from our
own research is on duck sex.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,420
A ducks are,
uh,

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,360
uh,
unusual among birds in having both a,

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,520
a,
a,

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,220
a,
a,

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,220
a typical mate choice situation where
male and females pair up on the basis of

13
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:55,050
display and preferences and
simultaneously other individuals that

14
00:00:55,051 --> 00:01:00,051
forced copulations on,
on a female docs as the approach

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,140
reproduction.
So what that means is that,

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,820
uh,
as the eggs were being laid,

17
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:10,821
females have to defend themselves from a
forced copulations by males.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,400
Now,
forced population is the word that

19
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,600
biologists use now,
but force over a century.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,680
A biologist used the word rape in
biology.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,880
Now that was abandoned back in the 19
seventies in response to the feminist

22
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:30,720
movement.
And Susan Brown Miller and her work a

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,110
against our will,
uh,

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,190
proposing and articulating a
specifically a social context for a rape

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,660
in humans.
This led to the creation of a euphemism

26
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,900
forced copulation in biology.
Unfortunately,

27
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,260
articulating a sexual violence in the
animal world with these euphemistic

28
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:58,701
terms has led to scientists losing track
of the fact that forced copulation is

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,710
against the will of the ducks.
And by taking the aesthetic perspective

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,300
and trying to understand what it is that
individual females in this case,

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,890
stocks want.
A,

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,000
we have arrived at a,
a new perspective on what it means when

33
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,130
they don't get what they want,
right?

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,490
So in some ways,
uh,

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,470
uh,
using,

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,430
uh,
socially sensitive euphemisms has led to

37
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,370
a,
a precision or fuzziness in,

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,290
in the science.

39
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,280
In the case of ducks x.
What we find is that males can force

40
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:39,090
themselves on females because they are
among the few birds that still have a

41
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,350
penis.
Uh,

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,410
and,
uh,

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,190
uh,
what we find in docs is the,

44
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,250
as a result of a female resistance and
male sexual violence,

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,880
we find a,
a,

46
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,050
a coevolution,
a arms race between male,

47
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,840
a capacity to force and female
resistance.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,730
In this case,
it takes place in the form of a genital

49
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,290
arms race.
The males evolve,

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,130
a more elaborate and more elaborately
armed penises.

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,840
And the females evolve convoluted
vaginal morphologies that exclude the

52
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,750
penis during forced copulations.
So the,

53
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,060
uh,
among the many weird things that a duck

54
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,090
penis is,
is that they're counterclockwise,

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,180
coiled,
uh,

56
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,230
well,
the female,

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,480
a vagina in ducks that have a high rates
of resistance actually coils in the

58
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,480
opposite direction.
So they have literally evolved in it

59
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,250
screwed device,
uh,

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,340
in their vaginal track that,
that ubs a,

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,270
obstructs the intermission of the penis
during forced copulation.

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Um,
what that means is that the,

63
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,470
uh,
what that tea party,

64
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,500
Senator Kennedy,
Todd Akin from Missouri said,

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,820
uh,
about,

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,830
uh,
women have a way of shutting that whole

67
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:55,570
thing down in reference to,
to rape is actually true of ducks.

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,910
But in a way that exposes something
fundamentally new and interesting about

69
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:05,290
evolutionary biology,
which is that sexual autonomy matters to

70
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,460
animals.
Freedom of choice is not merely a

71
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:14,461
political concept in discovered by a
suffragettes and feminists in the 19th

72
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:18,280
and 20th centuries,
but it's actually an evolved feature of

73
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:21,340
the social and sexual lives of other
species,

74
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,980
especially in docs.
How does this work?

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,160
Well,
if the female mates with the male she

76
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:30,310
prefers,
that is she gets the green had in the

77
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:30,821
quack,
quack,

78
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,270
quack that she likes,
and then her male offspring will share

79
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:38,380
that those traits and be sexually
preferred by other female docs who have

80
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:40,750
coevolved those same aesthetic
preferences.

81
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,640
But if she's forcibly fertilized,
then her male offspring will either

82
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,720
inherit a random trade or one that she
specifically rejected,

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,620
which means that her offspring will be
less attractive to other females.

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,290
So anything that female duck can do to
prevent force fertilization through

85
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,291
physical resistance or behavior will
evolve because she will be rewarded with

86
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,880
more grandkids.
Right?

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,570
So what this means is that a aesthetic
norms,

88
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,790
these shared ideas about what is
beautiful among ducks gives female ducks

89
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,910
the evolutionary leverage to advance
their freedom of choice in the

90
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,350
environment of persistent,
a sexual coercion and sexual violence,

91
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,430
right?
Uh,

92
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,680
this is really stunning.
In fact,

93
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:34,681
we know these ducks are so successful
because in species were 40 or 50 percent

94
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:40,231
of the populations are forced,
only two to five percent of the eggs in

95
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,160
the nest are fathered by males who are
not the social partner.

96
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,200
What that means is that females have a
98 percent a successful,

97
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,990
uh,
birth control device.

98
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,230
That is a behavior of Lee,
a deployable in the vaginal tract in

99
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,400
response to sexual violence,
right?

100
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,410
That's like FDA approvable,
right?

101
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,590
And what that shows is the power of
female choice to advance,

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,150
uh,
the sexual autonomy of individual

103
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,060
females.
One of the interesting things we learned

104
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,380
from,
uh,

105
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,150
examining,
um,

106
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
uh,
sexual conflict in docs is that,

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,230
uh,
the genital arms race between males and

108
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:30,200
females is not really a fair fight.
In fact,

109
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,450
uh,
the advances in feet in male coercive

110
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,960
capacity are really about control over a
female outcomes,

111
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,220
right?
They are about controlling,

112
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,940
physically controlling a fertilization.
However,

113
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,941
the countermeasures that females evolve
are not actually about power or control.

114
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,750
They merely reestablish a,
uh,

115
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:56,900
the,
the,

116
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,030
the freedom of choice,
if you will,

117
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,870
the flat playing field in which
individuals are free to choose who they

118
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:05,090
like right now,
this,

119
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,150
this sexual autonomy is not actually
about a control or control over other

120
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,510
people's,
uh,

121
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,610
or over other individuals,
uh,

122
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,444
sexual outcomes.

123
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,560
That's fascinating because this is a
cemetery between,

124
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,110
uh,
a male,

125
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,460
male coercion and female resistance in
duck sex,

126
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,270
uh,
has really fascinating parallels to a,

127
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,670
um,
a patriarchy and feminism in cultures

128
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,200
today.
So,

129
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,180
for example,
a patriarchy is historically and even in

130
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:43,640
a modern sense about coercive control,
uh,

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,810
over female reproductive autonomy,
uh,

132
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,940
whereas feminism is a really an ideology
of freedom of choice,

133
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,160
right?
And that's so that same cemetery between

134
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:56,380
male power and,
uh,

135
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,230
and freedom of choice a is elaborate and
present today.

136
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,330
And we can see this explicitly because
patriarchy and a men's rights,

137
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,290
uh,
and in cell a movements all articulate

138
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:14,291
feminism as a countervailing force have
control over a male reproductive

139
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,630
outcomes.
Uh,

140
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,270
but that's a fantasy.
In fact,

141
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,630
uh,
the,

142
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,410
the sexual autonomy includes the freedom
to be rejected at which,

143
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,880
uh,
uh,

144
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,900
is,
uh,

145
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,720
a lesson that we learned from duck sex.
