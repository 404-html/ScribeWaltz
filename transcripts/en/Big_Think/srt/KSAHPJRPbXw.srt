1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,240
Well,
there are lots of indications that there

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:10,340
still racism in American society.
If we look at overall indicators for

3
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:14,210
life chances,
a life expectancy in comm wealth,

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,240
educational attainment and performance
within schools,

5
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:22,010
we still see discernible differences in
performance between whites and Asians

6
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:24,470
and blacks and Latinos in the United
States.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,020
Uh,
some of those differences are attributed

8
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,010
to systemic or structural factors.
And to the extent that we can explain

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,640
those differences by systemic
instructional factors and we can,

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,370
that is evidence of racism in American
society.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,600
In addition,
while we don't see a lot of the racial

12
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,710
violence that we saw a century ago,
we still see examples of overt racial

13
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:48,350
violence in the United States today.
For instance,

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,750
uh,
the southern poverty law center has just

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,350
released a report that indicates that
there is a lot of racial violence in the

16
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,630
south directed towards Latinos,
um,

17
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,720
under the guise of xenophobia and anti
immigration stances.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,790
And so when we see these things
happening,

19
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,660
when we see news incidences,
um,

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,440
on the rise in 2007 towards African
Americans,

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,330
we can still say that there still
bigotry,

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,880
racism and prejudice and American
society

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,610
well indicates tremendous progress.
It demonstrates the power and influence

24
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:23,410
of the African American vote.
And it's a remarkable that African

25
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,120
Americans have been able to exercise
their,

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,470
a political influence in such a way 40
years after the passage of the voting

27
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,140
rights act.
Now 44 years after the passage of the

28
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:33,580
voting rights act.
Um,

29
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,240
it is a testament to the increasing
tolerance of nonblack communities and

30
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:40,600
putting their faith in confidence in
someone like Barack Obama to be their

31
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,110
president of the United States.
If we look at other candidacies for the

32
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,160
presidency,
for instance,

33
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:48,370
Jesse Jackson's a Democratic candidate
sees in 1984,

34
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:52,780
1988 people were not prepared to elect
an African American president at that

35
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:55,090
time.
So the fact that Obama was able to make

36
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:59,230
it past the nomination stage and to win
the presidency shows tremendous racial

37
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,490
progress in this country.

38
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,100
A post racial society should we ever
get,

39
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:10,390
there would be a society where when
social scientists like me run our models

40
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,970
and we include a race as a dummy
variable races no longer hours,

41
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,670
typically significant,
uh,

42
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,490
and we're just not there yet.
So anytime we run a model,

43
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,820
we see significant differences,
uh,

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,140
in that some of the indicators that I
mentioned before,

45
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:26,770
education and calm life expectancy,
a probability of going to jail,

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,760
other types of things.
And once those things are no longer

47
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:34,630
being predicted by race,
then we can say that we're in a post

48
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,340
racial society.
But until then,

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,770
um,
people's race stills actually very

50
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:41,440
significant in their lives.
And as an aside for the president,

51
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,420
um,
most people argue that his race wasn't a

52
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,800
hindrance to him.
And in fact,

53
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:46,580
it may have been a help to him.
Um,

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,190
racism and racial stereotyping cut both
ways.

55
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,290
Uh,
it can cut in negative ways and it can

56
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,120
cut in positive ways.
And so in many ways,

57
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:58,330
President Obama represented the
exception that proved the rule.

58
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,530
That's still the notion of race in our
society and it's still reifies negative

59
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,190
stereotypes towards African Americans.
And while it makes us feel good,

60
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,590
um,
and it may make us feel progressive or

61
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,800
liberal or cosmopolitan,
there's still some underlying racial

62
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,640
prejudice that goes into the attitude
and we need to be very mindful of that.

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,460
I think as post racialism is being
constructed in popular media today,

64
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:25,980
I think it does actually have,
uh,

65
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,850
the,
uh,

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,460
potential to water down diversity and,
um,

67
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:33,360
helps to obscure the need to appreciate
people's diversity.

68
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,310
Um,
oftentimes people will be indeed the

69
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:40,311
term post racialism during the last
election as a shortcut to be able to not

70
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:43,980
deal with a persistent racism in
American society.

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,250
I actually wrote about this in the
Washington Post and got attacked for it.

72
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,050
Um,
so,

73
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,010
uh,
people could say,

74
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:53,010
I voted for Barack Obama,
therefore I am not prejudiced.

75
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,580
I voted for Barack Obama.
Therefore there's no racism in American

76
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,110
society anymore.
You know,

77
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:01,170
one historic election while important.
Um,

78
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:06,171
and while pivotal is not necessarily a
sign that we have completely turned the

79
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:09,000
corner and we always have to be vigilant
about,

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,740
uh,
our own prejudices,

81
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:13,320
our own attitudes,
and this goes for minorities and non

82
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:15,810
minorities,
a light to be able to be on our guard to

83
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:19,440
recognize that we're all capable of
slipping back into old patterns of

84
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:23,160
action.
If we declare 2009 the post racial age

85
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:27,180
in America,
we end up sort of failing to recognize

86
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:30,750
that we are all still human and that we
are all still very susceptible to

87
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,450
allowed really bad attitudes towards
other groups.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Black leadership today looking at the
people who have been dubbed post racial

89
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:44,400
leaders in American society,
people like President Obama,

90
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,610
people like governor deval Patrick or
Mayor Cory Booker,

91
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:51,960
Adrian fenty or congressmen,
Archer Davis or Harold Ford owe a debt

92
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:55,770
of gratitude to the African American
forebearers who came before them,

93
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,430
who were not always welcome in
mainstream political circles,

94
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,750
who are perceived as being racialized,
who are often defined in direct

95
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:07,050
opposition to this young Khadra of
leadership.

96
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,240
And,
and most of them do recognize that they

97
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:12,510
owe a debt of gratitude to the
trailblazing steps that,

98
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,470
uh,
those,

99
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,660
uh,
forefathers and foremothers made for

100
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:16,830
them.
Um,

101
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,210
in terms of the current electoral system
in which many young black politicians

102
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,590
are running,
they do,

103
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,740
um,
really seek out alliances with Latinos

104
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,740
in their communities.
And so we know in this past election

105
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,520
that one of the things that Health
Barack Obama and his quest for the

106
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:36,390
presidency was increased a democratic
voting amongst Latinos.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,550
And so for the previous two election
cycles,

108
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:39,400
we had seen,
uh,

109
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,420
Latinos,
um,

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,920
identifying increasingly with the
Republican Party in terms of their vote.

111
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,490
We saw that tide switch and it was
actually going back to more normal

112
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,790
historic levels of voting behavior.
Most Latinos,

113
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,590
um,
there are a lot of cities where there

114
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:56,520
are blacks and Latinos who live side by
side and where both groups make up a

115
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:01,190
significant portion of the population.
And you do need a Latino support in

116
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,370
order to create a multiracial coalition
that puts blacks and office.

117
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,900
So to that extent,
yes.

118
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
Um,
there are some cities where a,

119
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,090
you don't see blacks and Latinos living
in the same space or in the same

120
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,540
political jurisdiction.
And so those alliances are less salient

121
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,010
and,
and those uh,

122
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,480
races.
But you know,

123
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,320
in most races you do need abroad and
multiracial coalition and that certainly

124
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,430
includes Latinos.

125
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,730
I studied African American leadership
and particularly interested in questions

126
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,250
of generational transition amongst
African Americans.

127
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,270
So I'm interested in black politicians
born after 1960.

128
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,900
What are the implications for having
been born after the civil rights

129
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,970
movement,
having been the beneficiary of the civil

130
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:46,270
rights movement in terms of being able
to run for political office,

131
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,270
um,
and being able to change the landscape

132
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:52,720
of what we usually consider an African
American political agenda.

133
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,380
Um,
so this has led to me editing one book

134
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,260
coming out later this year called who's
black politics cases in post racial

135
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,960
black leadership.
And I just received a contract for my

136
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:04,540
book that focuses on Newark,
New Jersey called Newark and the clash

137
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,470
of two Black Americas.
Um,

138
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,430
with respect or relating to these
issues.

139
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,480
I am interested in the intersection of
race and class in particular.

140
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,140
And looking at class based politics.
So usually we think about African

141
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,440
American politics,
um,

142
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,080
in terms of a deep political unity.

143
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,880
So we look at the fact that 90% of
African Americans usually vote

144
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:28,390
democratic and presidential elections.
That was 95% in 2008.

145
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,170
And we look at partisan identification
in the African American community being

146
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:36,290
about 80% democratic.
And so people assume that blacks were

147
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,130
monolithic political group.
We've always known that that wasn't

148
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:41,740
true,
but they're generally forces such as

149
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:45,820
discrimination and racism that have
compelled African Americans to close

150
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:49,030
ranks politically.
So my questions tend to ask,

151
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:51,010
well,
what happens within this democratic

152
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,920
coalition when you have African
Americans who represent different

153
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,650
political agendas,
who represent different political areas

154
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,270
and who are very explicitly represent
different types of class politics.

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,320
What's the impact on what we think of as
that classic African American Political

156
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,240
Agenda?
Or we're talking about reducing

157
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,370
inequality,
addressing poverty,

158
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,160
how to address poverty,
in what ways to frame that.

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,250
And so there's definitely a generational
battle within African American

160
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:16,630
communities over these issues.

161
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,460
And there's been this long standing,
um,

162
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,460
discussion about the efficacy of
adopting what we would call d racialized

163
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:27,520
politics and political science.
But what I think most journalists are

164
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:31,000
calling post racial politics.
So the politics of racial transcendence,

165
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,780
not necessarily making explicit racial
appeals to African American communities.

166
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,010
There are lots of people who are very
concerned that when candidates do not

167
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:42,070
talk about race on the campaign trail,
that they are hamstrung from being able

168
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:45,700
to address race any very forceful and
explicit way once they're in office.

169
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,970
Now that we have a critical mass of a
quote unquote post racial young black

170
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:55,590
political leaders who have used these
deviation racial strategies to in top is

171
00:08:55,591 --> 00:09:00,090
we now are going to be in a position to
be able to test a whether or not they

172
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,300
are effective in their office,
whether they are more effective than

173
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,110
there are black predecessors.
Um,

174
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,630
and whether or not we can actually
advance that classic African American

175
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,130
political agenda going forward.
