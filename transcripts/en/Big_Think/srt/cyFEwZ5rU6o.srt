1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,520
So the first thing you need to do in
order to reach your potential or do what

2
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:12,110
you really meant to do is understand
your own strengths and weaknesses.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,410
And it turns out that most people I
talked to do not know their strengths

4
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:19,310
and weaknesses.
They may be,

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,990
can take a stab at their strengths,
but they have a tough time writing down

6
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,710
their weaknesses.
The trap people fall in often is they

7
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:29,750
say,
I'm in a class of 50 other people,

8
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:33,320
or I'm in a job with 20 other peers and
ought to be able to be good at

9
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,320
everything they're good at if they're
good at something that I want to be good

10
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,120
at.
And the reality is every,

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:43,070
every person is good at certain things
to a certain degree and not as good at

12
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:45,380
others.
The trick is to figure out your

13
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:49,010
strengths and weaknesses and what the
things are you need to improve on.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,160
You have to assess them versus a
specific job.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,790
If I want to be a newspaper reporter,
there are certain sets of strengths and

16
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,460
weaknesses I need.
If I want to be an investment banker,

17
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,470
it's a different set of I want to be a
college professor.

18
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:03,410
It's another set.
So you need to understand your own

19
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:08,060
strengths and weaknesses and then
calibrate it to what you need to do very

20
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:11,600
well to be outstanding in that job.
Figuring out your strengths and

21
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,420
weaknesses probably is not something you
can do all by yourself.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,340
You need to get advice and observations
from people who watch you,

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,660
who see you in action and can point out
to you what you're good at and what

24
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:27,710
you're not good at.
And the reason it helps to get advice

25
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:31,730
from others is we all have blind spots.
Problem is it has to be skill based.

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,520
It can't be a morphis,
it can't be generalized needs to be

27
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:38,090
based on skills that are relevant to
whatever task you're doing.

28
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,590
And then ideally a coach would give you
some advice on techniques for improving

29
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:46,970
the skills you need to be open to
hearing things that you don't want to

30
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:51,971
hear and you need to not send off a vibe
that you don't want to hear.

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,950
Feedback.
The mistakes people make as they either

32
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,900
don't understand their own strengths and
weaknesses,

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,160
they're not willing to get advice from
others to get feedback on what they're

34
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:05,090
really good at and they don't calibrate
it against a job.

35
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,650
What I'm trying to encourage people to
do is do this systematically because

36
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:13,690
your strengths and your weaknesses are
really the building blocks of what,

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,290
whatever,
whatever you're going to try to do.
