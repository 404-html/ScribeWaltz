1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,160
So last year,
a fascinating study came out in the

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:04,460
journal Science,
um,

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,180
from a team led by Betsy Sparrow at
Columbia.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,630
And in the study those scientists showed
that people who used Google and who

5
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:18,730
thought that they would be able to
access information on a computer later

6
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:22,630
on didn't remember it as well as the
people who didn't think they would have

7
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:27,460
access to it.
So you have one kind of key variable.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,550
Do you think you'll be able to use your
computer later on to find this

9
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:32,230
information?
The answer is no.

10
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:35,020
You're going to remember it.
If the answer is yes,

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,640
you're not going to remember it,
but you will remember where to find it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,020
So you'll remember where it was stored.
You'll remember what the folder was,

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,570
you remember how to access it on the
computer.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,790
So it's not that you're not remembering
anything,

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,440
it's at,
you're remembering a very different

16
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,040
thing.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,190
Do you use your memory to store the
actual piece of information?

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,310
Do you use it to store the retrieval
process?

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,900
So I take a few things from this.
Um,

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,300
thing.
One technology can be very bad for our

21
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:09,301
memory if we let it be bad for it.
So if we always rely on it,

22
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,160
and if we have this attitude of,
oh,

23
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:15,520
I don't need to remember this because
I'll always be able to look it up,

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,920
you won't remember it,
and then you won't have that knowledge

25
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:21,340
in your head and then you won't have
anything in your attic to play with.

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,990
You won't have that knowledge base.
You won't be able to be imaginative like

27
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:27,370
homes.
You won't be able to reach those

28
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:29,980
conclusions because your attic will be
pretty bare.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,670
But we can also use it to enhance our
memory,

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,080
um,
by saying,

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,330
okay,
I know that there are these great

32
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,840
technological benefits,
why don't I use that to create this

33
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,910
virtual storage space for myself?

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,840
So homes does this,
two homes has files that he accesses and

35
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,651
he says,
Watson,

36
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,990
you know,
look up my file for this case.

37
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:53,590
Look up my file for this case.
So he remembers that he has the file.

38
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:57,160
He remembers that there was a case.
He doesn't necessarily remember all of

39
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:01,000
these details.
So you can think of Google as this

40
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,940
vastly expanded Holmesii and filing
system.

41
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,290
So you can use it for exactly that.
What are the things that I want to

42
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:13,291
remember and that I want to be able to
access later on and focus on remembering

43
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,470
how to access them and then keep your
mind space for those things that you

44
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,830
think will be important for you to know
at any point.

45
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,070
So the exercise that I like to say for
myself as if I were on a desert island

46
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,540
with no power or I don't even have to go
to a desert island in Hurricane Sandy,

47
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,340
I had no power,
no Internet,

48
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,590
no cell phone service,
nothing.

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,300
So if hurricane sandy strikes again and
I don't have anything,

50
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,570
do I have everything that I need
immediately in my head?

51
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,180
Um,
what are those things that I really

52
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,860
can't rely on a computer for?

53
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,580
Yeah.
