1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,570
Waves of immigration,
they have fresh and refreshed America.

2
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,450
You can see it,
you can see this wave of Hispanic

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,430
immigration,
refreshing America,

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,820
just as the European immigration,
so of the 20th century refreshed

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,070
America.
And we have such a tremendous capacity

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,950
to take people in and make them
American.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,040
Um,
the American system is so,

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,860
um,
is so strong that it is an ease.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,740
It,
it changes it,

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,420
it reacts,
but it also,

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,240
and it,
it,

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,420
it,
it reshapes itself a little bit,

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,390
but it's so encompassing and to a
certain extent,

14
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,150
so welcoming.
If you look at the way Americans field,

15
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:50,850
despite the debate about immigration
these days,

16
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,240
if you look at about the way Americans
feel about,

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,780
uh,
bringing people in and being an

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,130
American,
uh,

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,250
the view is if you come here and want to
be an American,

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,990
uh,
and act like an American,

21
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,170
you are an American.
That is certainly not the view in large

22
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,210
parts of the world.
And in many,

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,120
many Western countries,
uh,

24
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,050
in the,
in the,

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,480
in the public.
It's not the view of the public's money.

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,620
The.
