1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,180
I wouldn't say it was a dilemma,
but it was a.

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,100
It was a problem and it was a a not
uncommon problem for a big global

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:19,690
company in the early 19 nineties,
we started to do global sourcing and

4
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:24,160
what that means is you're basically
buying a either product or sub

5
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:29,161
assemblies or things that go into
products from companies outside the

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,210
United States where you have a
contractual relationship with them.

7
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,070
They're not your employees,
they're third parties.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,110
The question was would we impose ethical
sourcing on those companies and by that

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,890
we mean that you make sure that they had
no prisoner child labor,

10
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,810
that they had decent environmental
standards,

11
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:47,470
that they had decent wages and decent
working conditions and decent living

12
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:50,140
conditions.
If the employees in fact lived on the

13
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:53,680
facilities.
We had no legal obligation to do that

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,550
because these were not our facilities.
These were not our employees,

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,090
but we decided that we would require
this of our sourcing partners because it

16
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:06,010
was important to do for at least three
reasons.

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,320
Number one,
we were concerned that there might be

18
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:11,140
enforcement of law against them which
would stop supply even though

19
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:14,320
enforcement in some of these countries
like China is very erratic.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Number two,
we were very concerned about our

21
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:20,410
employees morale if we had one set of
standards 50 miles away,

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,710
but allowed much poor standards in our
suppliers.

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,530
That would be,
I think for at least some employees.

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,630
Very disconcerting.
Why were we being so hypocritical?

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,280
One standard in our plants and other
standard somewhere else,

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,120
especially when those standards could be
very injurious to the public.

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,050
For example,
one of the early suppliers I went to in

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,560
China was literally putting mercury from
making light bulbs in the sluice ways

29
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:48,910
which went into the rice paddies,
which we of course put a stop to a and

30
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:51,100
then the third reason,
at least in the company that I worked

31
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:56,101
for is that we were an icon of
globalization and one of the criticisms

32
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:59,050
of globalization is that you're
exporting bad practices that you

33
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,010
wouldn't do at home.

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,430
So we felt that it was important that in
our supply chain we not allow these

35
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,980
kinds of bad practices.
That would be an example of a decision

36
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:12,310
that we made was not required by law
that you could call.

37
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:15,250
It was an ethical decision,
something beyond what the law requires,

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,160
which we gave a lot of thought to and
very early in the,

39
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,990
in the early nineties,
mid nineties,

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,670
started to have a program when we
qualified suppliers that they had to

41
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:28,990
meet these other conditions involving
child labor,

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,940
prison labor environment.
So on.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,000
Not just that they made good products in
their finances were okay.

44
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,590
So that would be an example of how you
reason about establishing a global

45
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,960
ethical standard beyond what the law
requires.
