1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,940
Well,
there's lots of things you do from a

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,320
practical point of view,
a secretary learns how to say,

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,300
um,
questions like,

4
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,610
well,
maybe you should call the social work

5
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:27,940
department first before we booked this
appointment.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,040
Or,
um hmm,

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:35,041
the schedule looks really full.
All of those things are honestly

8
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:36,790
practical things.
Doctors do

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,070
second,
many of the larger hospitals like my

10
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,340
own,
um,

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,480
have a free care pool and we'll have
people apply to it so that they can get

12
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:50,760
their care.
But there are delays built into that.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,450
And,
and you see that happen.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,400
Um,
the next thing though is that when

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,960
you're committed to the idea that,
look,

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,900
I want to help anybody I can coming in
the door.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,920
Um,
you still have the questions of how to

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,980
arrange for their care and manage it.
I can't tell you how dramatically my

19
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,110
practice changed.
When the Massachusetts health reform

20
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:14,944
went through.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,970
We went from being a state with about 12
percent uninsured and that was about the

22
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:22,180
percentage of my patients who could not
pay for my treatments.

23
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,380
And,
and,

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,350
you know,
I would forgo the surgery costs and the

25
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,720
hospital would eat the,
the,

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,970
um,
the medical bills,

27
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,030
but you'd still have to figure out how
are they going to pay for outpatient

28
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:36,790
chemotherapy,
certain kinds of radiation treatments,

29
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,880
things like that.
And it was a nightmare over and over

30
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,010
again.
And um,

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,530
when the reform bill came through,
well,

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,270
we put this way.
It's been two years and I've not had a

33
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,420
patient in those circumstances for my
state.

34
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,980
Um,
uh,

35
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,520
since then.
And uh,

36
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,120
and it's,
you almost don't notice that used to

37
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,680
grapple with these issues all the time.

38
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,220
I face ethical dilemmas all the time.
Um,

39
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,580
their routine.
Um,

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,660
the 19 year old patient who,
uh,

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,610
uh,
sticks in my mind because right before

42
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:18,520
the Massachusetts health reform came
through,

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,910
I'd seen her and she had a metastatic
thyroid cancer.

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Her cancer had really spread widely.
We did the surgery and then it turned

45
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:31,840
out that she needed chemotherapy and
radiation,

46
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:34,740
but her insurance coverage ran out.
She only had a,

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,960
had a $75,000 cap on her policy and she
didn't want me to tell her parents about

48
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,250
her condition,
um,

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,610
because she knew they would try to find
a way to pay for all of this,

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,510
that,
that is a kind of ethical dilemma.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,020
Um,
it would seem to me a no brainer.

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,770
I called her parents
and sure enough know they,

53
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,140
they got a second mortgage on their
house.

54
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,610
They found a way to make damn well sure
their daughter got the treatment she

55
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,180
needed.

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,130
Um,
but you have everything ranging from

57
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,970
someone who um,
uh,

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,310
doesn't want to leave the hospital.
They,

59
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,260
they are in the hospital and um,
there were better.

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,300
But um,
you know,

61
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,320
they just,
they,

62
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:26,980
they,
uh,

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,650
things are kind of a mess at home and
they'd love a couple of extra days in

64
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,810
the hospital even though it's $2,000 a
day.

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,670
How,
how,

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,770
how do you grapple effect?
Do you kick them out?

67
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,860
How do you kick them out?
Or do you just say,

68
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:40,090
well,
you know,

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,660
this is my patient.
What,

70
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,533
what,
what they,

71
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,800
they're the customer with what they say
goes.

72
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,240
And,
um,

73
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,370
uh,
you can't,

74
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,290
you,
you find moral questions are,

75
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,790
I'm a daily part of what you do as a
physician and a part of what makes it so

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,440
interesting.
