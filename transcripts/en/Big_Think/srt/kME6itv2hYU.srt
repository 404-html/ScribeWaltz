1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,560
That is a contradiction between economic
growth and the public space.

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,330
First of all,
I think the most crucial competitive

3
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:27,331
factor in
our time is he's not like the car,

4
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,140
the cruiser competitive factor in our
time.

5
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,720
It's not like he was in the past land or
even capital,

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,950
but people how to attract and retain the
best qualified people.

7
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:46,840
So I would say the most crucial
competitive issue in our time is quality

8
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:51,430
of life.
A public space is crucial for quality of

9
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,590
life.
Public pedestrian space,

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,243
Eh,

11
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,790
gives us quality.
It needs to retain great people at.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,140
But also it's very important for the
people who live there themselves for the

13
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,840
poor.
I believe that there is no contradiction

14
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:16,841
whatsoever in trying to have investments
in great public pedestrian space,

15
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,470
but gratefully space,
however different from most things

16
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:28,820
governments do is not just a means.
Most things governments do are a means

17
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:32,210
to economic development.
Governments invents the roads in

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,880
tunnels,
in irrigation districts,

19
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:36,440
in ports,
in airports,

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,993
uh,

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,320
because it's necessarily for the country
to,

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,870
to produce material,

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,253
eh,

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,480
goods and services,
but,

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
but,
but they are a means to an end.

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,890
The end.
What is the end?

27
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:57,830
The end is happiness in the case of
politic.

28
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:02,831
Pedestrian space is a very peculiar good
because it's an end in itself.

29
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:07,850
I mean it just to have great public
space makes people happier and creates

30
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:10,160
more social integration.
Again,

31
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:14,870
I believe it also creates economic
development because actually,

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,340
for example,
if I asked some people to go live in

33
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,110
some,
some cities in the third world have

34
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:29,111
serious problems like Lego's in Nigeria.
If people want to get

35
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,803
eh,

36
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,030
some,
a person to go live in lake or some,

37
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,370
uh,
some expert engineer in something,

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,630
they will have to pay him very,
very much to compensate for the

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,300
hardships of being in Legos if they had.
Instead,

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,080
when people go to Paris,
it happens.

41
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:54,070
The opposite.
People are willing to take a reduction

42
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,210
in their material will be in,
they go to a,

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,400
they may go without a car,
they go with a much smaller apartment

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,520
because the city gave them so much back.
So actually to invest in a good city is

45
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,820
good business is not robots and making
investment decisions.

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,430
And,
uh,

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,720
we need to make us eat that is
attractive to the people we most want to

48
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:28,911
have an sat
at adults who could actually go anywhere

49
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:34,341
in the world they want because they are
such good technicians or an artist or a

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,880
professionals or whatever they do that
they could choose to go wherever they

51
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:44,310
want.
And if we don't have a great city,

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,780
they will.
