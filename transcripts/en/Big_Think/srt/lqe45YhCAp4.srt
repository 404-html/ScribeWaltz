1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,350
So Moore's laws or the law of the
computer industry that says compute

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,310
power doubles every 24 months or so.
And you know,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,370
that sort of put out there by experts in
technology development is sort of,

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,470
you know,
the prototype,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,900
you know,
that's the thing that it really shoot

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,110
for more as law,
but nobody ever keeps up with Moore's

7
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:19,950
law.
It's up the computer industry.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,060
So it's saying we actually track and
have been tracking really,

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,750
you know,
the past 15 years in terms of the costs

10
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:32,070
for Dna sequencing and uh,
trying our best to keep up with Moore's

11
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:32,791
law.
And we actually,

12
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,270
we actually did keep up with Moore's law
really quite effectively,

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,700
uh,
near the end of the genome project.

14
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:42,510
And even in a number of years for about
four or five years after the genome

15
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:45,330
project using the old fashion method
that we used to use,

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,190
um,
for DNA sequencing.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,170
But we had sufficiently industrialized
those methods and it actually allowed us

18
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,940
to keep up with Moore's law.
And then what happened about 2007 our

19
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,850
major groups switched over to these
fancy new methods.

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,680
They're called next generation DNA
sequencing methods and almost overnight

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,440
and has just continued to do it up to
the present time.

22
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:11,880
They outstrip Moore's law by far and
it's really been truly remarkable.

23
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:16,350
They'll cost of DNA sequencing have
plummeted tremendously so that that

24
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:20,580
first human genome sequence that was
completed 10 years ago cost $1 billion.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,630
And now we can sequence a human genome
today in a matter of a day or two.

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,170
And it costs well under $10,000.
Really just a few thousand dollars.

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,570
And if you follow the curves,
which we've been following,

28
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:33,060
you can see particularly over the last
six years,

29
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:38,061
we have outpaced Moore's law by far.
So among the many exciting developments

30
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,020
in genomics,
um,

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,410
really continues to be new technologies
for sequencing DNA.

32
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,010
We've come along way and have incredibly
powerful methods today,

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,940
but there's new ones coming and we
continue to invest in the development of

34
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:53,490
new technologies because we see the
importance of it.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,520
Um,
there's a particular new methodology

36
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:59,880
that's getting a lot of attention in the
genomics community these days called

37
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,030
nanopore sequencing.
It really is just these molecules that

38
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:07,980
sit and lip ud by layers and the strands
of DNA sort of get pulled through it and

39
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:12,660
literally are able to detect every
single base on that DNA ladder.

40
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,990
One at a time as it gets pulled through.
The nanopore is just way cool.

41
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,060
But what's particularly cool about it is
that the technologies are,

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,720
can be reduced to really small form.
And one of the companies that's

43
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,240
manufacturing is releasing an instrument
this year that um,

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,980
uh,
basically looks like a USB device.

45
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,170
In fact,
it is a USB device a little bit bigger

46
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:39,171
than a thumb drive and literally it
plugs into the USB port of a laptop

47
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,554
computer.

48
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,230
And um,
I haven't seen it,

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,540
I haven't seen it operate yet,
but I'm told it can sequence a human

50
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,680
genome and something like a day we'll
have to see when it's released.

51
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,390
I'll how it really performs.
But the notion,

52
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,730
you know,
and whether it's that company,

53
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,080
whether it's this year,
whether it's another company that's

54
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,070
another year,
it's not science fiction to believe that

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,910
we will have these little USB devices
sitting in our laptop that can read out

56
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,640
human genome sequences.
And the next year or two or three.

57
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,730
One of the things I think is
particularly cool with this first

58
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,320
company that's launching,
um,

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,080
uh,
these USB devices is that the company

60
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:19,081
tells me that the USB device that it
will sequence a human genome will work

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,110
equally well in a pc or a macintosh
computer,

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,840
which makes me think everything.
