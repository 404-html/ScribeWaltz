1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,190
Well.
Okay,

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,560
I've got the perfect,
it's a painting by Pizarro and Pizarro

3
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,330
lived in south London,
near Crystal Palace.

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,260
It's a very high point in lunch,
a lot of impressionist slip there.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,470
And uh,
um,

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,290
another,
not a movement in the name of which have

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,380
just forgotten.
Um,

8
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,560
and Pizarro painted a picture of
pendulous station.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,190
Okay.
I'm paige.

10
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:56,191
Where station was the station that I
went to every day when I went to work as

11
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:02,701
a 15 year old apprentice.
And it was my ambition when I grew up to

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,230
become a famous artist and buy that
painting,

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,290
which are course never can.
But since you've asked me a hypothetical

14
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,540
question,
that's the,

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,280
yeah.
