1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,300
I like this new wave of feminine crime
fiction writers who are feminist but not

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,300
in the upg politically correct way that
feminism is an authentic feminism.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,760
You know,
they don't have this pattern ising

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,660
attitude.
Like,

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,620
you know,
women,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,260
women should always be passive victims
and so on.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,520
But even maybe now I will say something
for rich,

8
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:31,410
maybe I not be popular here even better
than how she called Gillian Flynn or

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,411
what is an Irish girl called Tana
French?

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,200
A theories of crime fiction taking place
in Dublin with more or less the same

11
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,380
spirit,
the same attitude.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,460
A kind of a,
if I have to invent some stupid title,

13
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:54,290
a kind of a dark New York feminist,
uh,

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,373
uh,
uh,

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,020
crime thrillers.
But know of the,

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,530
of the movie that I recently saw,
there is a problem.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,220
Often a movie attracts me,
not attract me,

18
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:13,221
but gives me to think intellectually,
but I don't really like it.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,680
Uh,
as a movie for example,

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,540
uh,
the one,

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,890
uh,
her with your,

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,180
when you know,
uh,

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,100
in the field at the end,
she is the hero together with the girl,

24
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,480
I think she's called amy,
but they are both abandoned by their

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,630
machines.
The big enigma here is,

26
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:38,631
and this is what always attracted me,
and this is I think what my mentor in

27
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:43,200
theory,
French tracker and list Jacques Lacan in

28
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,960
this,
that in his crazy fees is there is no

29
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,160
sexual relationship,
which means we are never alone.

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,930
Me and my partner,
there has to be a third element as

31
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,090
fantasy scene,
an intruder.

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,180
It's only through that mediation of a
third element here in her,

33
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,110
their operating systems that sex
functions.

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,180
And then I started to think about other
variations of this.

35
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,510
Like for example,
a perfect there intelligently mate,

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,600
20 years old,
British publicity for beer,

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,850
which is a var,
wonderful,

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,170
ironic repetition of a old fairy tale
motive.

39
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,020
You know,
a young girl walks by a stream,

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,140
she's a frog.
And of course that's what you do in

41
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:38,970
fairy tales.
She picks up and kisses the frog and the

42
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:43,971
frog into a prince charming young man.
But then the publicity goes on.

43
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,970
The charming Yank man looks at her,
kisses her and she turns into a can of

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,250
beer.
You know,

45
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,830
like that's what he really wanted,
you know,

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
and then I found here in the states,
and similar but inverted versions,

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,560
some pretty disgusting mentally
publicity for Taco Bell publicity for

48
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,730
something called Casa Ardito,
which is Kisa Delia in Burrito

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,570
combination of the two.
And it's presented in such an obscene

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
way that if you combine the two,
it's really like a penis in wrapped by a

51
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,270
vagina.
But if,

52
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,010
how is the publicity spot down here?
Uh,

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,630
a young guy and the girl see during
lunch break at a table,

54
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,550
one has guess ideally at the other
Burrito and they look at each other and

55
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:41,551
then you see each person's dream boy
looks at her and imageries the future.

56
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,360
They start to talk,
they get married,

57
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,940
have children,
then she looks at him,

58
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,690
approach him in her dream and take his
piece of Burrito or whatever.

59
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,910
Uh,
what apps keep apps that she gets a kind

60
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,720
of a bisexual completing and just makes
a sign and he disappears.

61
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,460
You know,
it's similar to that word beer,

62
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,090
but what I think is the deep enigma
behind all this.

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,530
Why do we never get just a couple?
Why it always has to be some intruders

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,660
and the best Hollywood version of this,
I ask all the viewers

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,110
who are watching us now to to download,
you can download it for free.

66
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:33,280
It's an American classic movies,
Preston Sturgis Lady Eve,

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,780
where you have the ultimate marriage
proposal scene.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,320
You have a Henry Fonda and Barbara
stanwyck and a horse standing behind

69
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,060
them and the horse's head is always
intruding and so on and so on.

70
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,030
That is the mystery of sex.
It's never too,

71
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,630
you always need something and imagined
gaze,

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,660
an element intruding and so on.
And so on.
