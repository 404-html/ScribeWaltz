1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,490
A lot better than a lot of people
thought I was going to start with that.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,540
It is a
rather surprising to me in some ways

3
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:23,701
that it's done this well this long
because I was taught at the University

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,250
of Chicago and northwestern that it was
terribly important for countries to have

5
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:38,671
savings and to invest a lot in the
future and that had a lot to do with how

6
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:43,020
well they're doing.
Well.

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,040
America today
has the lowest savings rate it has had

8
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,560
in many,
many years.

9
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,590
At the national level.
It's fallen dramatically from all 10,

10
00:00:56,591 --> 00:01:01,591
11 percent of the GDP is,
we call it down to one or two personal

11
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,530
savings rates.
Stunningly,

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,340
I've gone from nine percent of our
disposable income to a minus one percent

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,760
and we become very gifted,
a ardent robust to consumers and

14
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:23,881
borrowers and savers.
Now the big question is we become huge

15
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,880
borrowers as a country with our very
large deficits.

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,520
We become borrowers at the consumer
level with very hard debt levels and a

17
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,600
really lousy savings levels.
And the big question I have about the

18
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,860
American economy is not today,
but it's how long we think we can

19
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:49,861
continue because we've got some huge
challenges that are coming.

20
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,220
We have 78 million baby boomers twice
the size of the current generation due

21
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:05,911
to begin retiring next year.
We have social security and Medicare

22
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:11,020
that are programs that are where we made
a lot of promises,

23
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:15,430
but we haven't funded them
and we've grossly misled.

24
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:20,431
The American people was such a
euphemisms as the social security trust

25
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:26,860
fund.
I argue it's oxymoron.

26
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:31,090
It shouldn't be trusted and it's not
funded because the money's already been

27
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:36,091
spent and we haven't provided for those
programs.

28
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,710
We are getting to be fancy language.
We have something called a current

29
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,610
account deficit which measures are
deaths.

30
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:50,360
It's abroad,
which is largely the trade depths.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
It's now twice as high as a percentage
of the economy as it's ever been in

32
00:02:55,991 --> 00:03:00,991
America's history and we're borrowing
and borrowing and becoming

33
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,780
dysfunctionally and I think
destructively,

34
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:09,730
but depending on the long run on Chinese
money,

35
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,740
in Japanese money in Asian money and so
forth and which they lend us money.

36
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,180
Funny thing about borrowing,
you have to pay it back at some time and

37
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:29,181
as a country we can't continue to borrow
a seven percent of the whole economy,

38
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:35,190
which is what we're borrowing now for
very many years without looking like a

39
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:40,191
very different America than we have now.
So I think the economy today is in

40
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:46,140
pretty good shape though,
was getting pretty turbulent now with

41
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:49,860
housing and housing is a wonderful
example.

42
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,060
I did quite a study about 18 months ago
and that was simply astonished at the

43
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:04,070
number of people who bought homes,
no money down.

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,340
It's called interest on me
and then I was astonished that even

45
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:15,380
though mortgage rates at the lowest
level in 30 years,

46
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,950
they've averaged around nine point seven
percent or something like that and now

47
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,180
they're like six people are not taking
longterm fixed mortgages.

48
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,060
About half of them are taking what are
called adjustable rate mortgages.

49
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,120
Well one might say,
gee,

50
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:39,810
that's fine.
If we have a lot of savings that we've

51
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:44,811
stacked away and if we aren't borrowing
very much for other purposes,

52
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,010
that isn't true.
We're borrowing more Maura's upset of

53
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,860
her income than we have in many,
many years.

54
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,060
So now we've had this big blow out of
the so called subprime mortgage market

55
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,990
and today I hear on the press that
housing prices are falling and so forth.

56
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,120
What did we think was gonna happen?
How are these loans going to get paid

57
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:16,080
back if we don't have any savings are
already heavily borrowed.

58
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,190
So my concerns about the economy of this
country are much more in the future and

59
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:27,570
much more of our culture.
We had become from one of the biggest

60
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:32,310
savers and the world and saving remember
as a metaphor for the future,

61
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,670
uh,
we've become the biggest consumers and

62
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:40,250
borrowers in the world,
which is kind of another way of saying,

63
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:41,220
Dang,
I want it all.

64
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:45,180
I want it now and I don't want to give
up anything and kind of to hell with the

65
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:50,181
future.
So I am a far more concerned with

66
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:53,460
America's economic future 10,
15,

67
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:57,590
20 years from now than I am.
What happens over the next months.

68
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,790
I am planning to

69
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,150
my,
a from blackstone going public.

70
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:10,990
A lot of it and it's quite a windfall
and set up a

71
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,370
what will turn out to be a very large
foundation

72
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,900
and because I've been boring people
relentlessly for the last 20,

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,330
30 years about some of these problems,
um,

74
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,950
I'm going to take a number of these
problems that are what I call

75
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,870
undeniable,
an unsustainable and yet politically

76
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:42,871
untouchable because of the political
culture we now live in where it's

77
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:49,900
considered almost politically terminal
ever asked anybody to give up anything

78
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,970
or pay for anything and you know,
I want more and more and more and I,

79
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,570
I want it now.
And to take these issues which I think

80
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,690
are serious threat to America's future
and uh,

81
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,150
take those issues where there's a huge
gap

82
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,150
between what we should be doing and what
we could be doing and what we are not

83
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:16,984
doing.

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,160
And figure out how at the margin
a major foundation might be able to make

85
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,290
a difference.
When I think of young people today and I

86
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:34,291
think of what we're leaving them
a 10,

87
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,100
15,
20 years from now,

88
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,900
you remind me of that old,
a joke in the philosophy class where the

89
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,190
professor asks the students,
which is worse,

90
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,770
ignorance,
ignorance or apathy,

91
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,770
and some poor kid from the back of the
class says,

92
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:55,570
I don't know,
and I don't care.

93
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,870
Well,
I think it's an interesting question.

94
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,510
Is there an exciting way that we could
get the young people to this country

95
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,070
aware and their parents because I
refused to believe that parents have

96
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:16,510
suddenly become cold and indifferent to
their own kids and grand computers.

97
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:21,511
I think they've been deceived and a
misinformed and disinfect and so forth,

98
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,880
so we have a political system today,
for example,

99
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:32,881
where the elderly are unbelievably well
represented.

100
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,490
The American Association of Retired
Persons as 38 dues paying $38 million

101
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:42,160
dues paying members.
They write more,

102
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:46,810
they lobby more,
they call more and by and large it's not

103
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:50,260
too unfair to say a lot of their
programs are.

104
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,070
We want more,
even though by any standard,

105
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,720
as I say,
some of these challenges are

106
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,190
unsustainable.
We can't,

107
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,930
we're not going to be able to meet the
promises that we've made.

108
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,010
So on the one hand we have these,
this culture of our ethic of shared

109
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:14,880
sacrifice being kind of a dirty word,
not wanting to give up anything.

110
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,910
We have political organizations who are
dominant in representing one age group

111
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,170
and the young people who were all about
the future or somehow being slipped this

112
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:33,561
huge check
hidden check I might add for our free

113
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:39,390
lunch and nobody seems to be doing
anything about it.

114
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,200
So I would like to gather together the
student and the young leaders of this

115
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:51,360
country and uh,
take a day or two and say,

116
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,380
try to give you the biggest best running
around I can and half a dozen areas of

117
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,530
the economy and fiscally and what the
world looks like.

118
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,910
And then I want you to contemplate that
because it's not my future.

119
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,950
It's yours.
I'm 81 years old.

120
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,970
I Lord knows I don't need anything more.
And ask you what are the best ways to do

121
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,181
something about it and should we have an
American Association of young people and

122
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,810
their parents,
for example,

123
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,650
because until this democracy gets
educated and get some form,

124
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,160
which is the first requirement,
and then get active and motivated.

125
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,960
Not much is going to happen on these
problems unless there's a huge crisis

126
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,440
and it will be a very costly crisis when
it hits.

127
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,200
So
that's a long winded answer how I feel

128
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,410
about the economy.
I I'm much more concerned about the

129
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,280
longterm picture that I am over the next
year or two or three.

130
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,960
My parents' generation,
the greatest generation for

131
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,240
fought the most costly war in history.
Costly in every sense of that word.

132
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,600
They built international institutions,
Marshall Plan and so forth,

133
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,630
which was central to the world getting
restored.

134
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,540
They had gi bill or rights for all the
returning veterans went to college.

135
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,340
They rebuild the infrastructure of this
country,

136
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,420
but they didn't ask me to pay for it.
They paid for it because they were

137
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:43,560
willing to invest in the future and that
meant saving.

138
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,860
And that meant consuming less.
I tell these university audiences,

139
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,620
I think a careful study of your
sociologist,

140
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,100
of your social psychologists,
have your political scientists of your

141
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:05,101
economists have your historians and say,
what was it during those early times and

142
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,840
where more Americans than I'm afraid
today had a clear sense of the future

143
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:19,291
and a responsibility for it and what led
us to this notion,

144
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,940
I'm going to grab what I can and the
government owes me this and the

145
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:29,941
government owes me that and a kind of to
hell with other people or to hell with

146
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,610
the future to hell with
who and how we're going to pay for all

147
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,140
this.
Now,

148
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:43,141
why did that come about?
What led to this boomer mentality?

149
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:43,850
You know,
about?

150
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,550
I wanted it all.
I got to enjoy it.

151
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,270
And uh,
I have a dear friend who

152
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,830
is there an aspect of the medical
profession.

153
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,870
He's kind of complaining that it's not
a,

154
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,143
Hey,
I'm

155
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,580
millionaire or mold omitted in her or
whatever.

156
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,911
And I said,
well,

157
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:08,220
you know,
one way people become millionaires is

158
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,240
they save and they invest,
but he's got to have a smaller plane and

159
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,030
he flies on the weekend.
Is he points out to me is not a jet,

160
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:20,601
and I said,
well,

161
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,210
I understand I don't have a jet either,
but,

162
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
and Oh,
um,

163
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,400
you know,
I need to have fun because I worked so

164
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:33,260
hard all week and I need a porsche car,
you know,

165
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,390
so forth.
And that is the boomer mentality that

166
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:43,391
we're kind of dealing with here and I
don't really know what lead from saving

167
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:49,040
and investing into the future,
which consoling and borrowing.

168
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,230
Now,
uh,

169
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,260
did America get a disenchanted by the
Vietnam war?

170
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,680
The tore this country apart?
Did we get torn apart by the

171
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,470
fascination of presidents and
presidents,

172
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:14,471
brothers and Martin Luther King and
riots in the streets?

173
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,650
And uh,
uh,

174
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,030
I was gonna say I was working on this
problem in Chicago is a terrifying side

175
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:28,031
to say.
And then somehow the bonds that united

176
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,600
us in Helios lead to the current
situation.

177
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:39,230
I'm not sure,
but I've never seen a time when there is

178
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:44,231
so much bitterness and partisanship and
paralysis as we have today in our

179
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:48,890
government.
I mean,

180
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:52,970
nothing went through areas or areas
where

181
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,280
the Republican leadership in the
democratic leadership are united for a

182
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:03,480
much longer larger cause,
namely the nation's interest.

183
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,470
We've had very little of that recently.
So I'm putting.

184
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:10,650
I don't know what all the reasons are.
I just know there's been a,

185
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,690
a really major shift.
I think if I may,

186
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,100
just to insult your medium,
it entirely possible that

187
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,340
television
has had its impact.

188
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,930
For example,
I used to watch my children,

189
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:35,931
I admire there wasn't television
and they turn on the TV

190
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,740
and pounded into their heads.
Here's this toy.

191
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,840
They had a habit,
there's the stress.

192
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:49,070
They gotta have this and we've developed
a kind of a

193
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
indulgent instinct,
gratification consumption,

194
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,580
large s,
uh,

195
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,820
that has become part of our culture.
And I don't,

196
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:02,900
I,
I,

197
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,480
I don't know all the reasons for it,
but certainly the presence of such an

198
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:11,180
effective medium and television is
probably one of the,

199
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,360
uh.
