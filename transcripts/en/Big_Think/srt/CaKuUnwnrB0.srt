1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,150
Why is it the greatest challenge facing
both parties?

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,580
Fundamental change.
You can live in a lot of moments in

3
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:19,240
American history where the is you're
born into and the world's you governor

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,540
that vastly different and they're always
different 30 or 40 years past.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,370
You know,
things are gonna change in a country.

6
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:26,410
But uh,
but that said,

7
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,090
you know,
you can there if you were,

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,880
if you were born at a certain point in
the 20th century after,

9
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:31,540
you know,
the,

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,540
after the Great Depression and you were
governing in the 1960s or 1970s,

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,183
you know,
the world was,

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,900
the economy was pretty much the economy
it was supposed to be.

13
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:44,410
It was run by an industrial engine.
The world was still divvied up among

14
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,330
states who did,
you know,

15
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:48,190
menaced each other only or,
you know,

16
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,780
sign treaties and didn't manage each
other.

17
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:51,160
I mean,
the world was pretty much the one.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,590
You had telephones and you had
television,

19
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:56,020
you had nicer televisions and you had
cable TV.

20
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,840
But people were still communicating with
one another and much the same way.

21
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,020
And they were still posting letters by
hand and sending them in a mailbox,

22
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:02,980
you know?
Uh,

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,200
and then you have a moment like this
where,

24
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:05,980
uh,
where,

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,220
where the world is just vastly different
than it was 30,

26
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,031
40 years ago.
And in a sense,

27
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,590
we're caught between moments,
right?

28
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:14,830
We're in between this industrial age and
what comes next because we still have

29
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:18,130
vestiges one foot in the past,
vestiges of the past and one foot there

30
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:21,250
and one foot in the future.
So the challenge for the Democratic

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,060
Party or any party has to lead the way
into that future is to articulate what,

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,450
what government and the economic engine
and foreign policy of a country are

33
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,284
going to look like.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,420
Uh,
in the era where none of those things

35
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,540
are operable anymore,
when the economy is nonindustrial

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,530
driven,
where people communicate with each other

37
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,240
all over the world in a flash,
right,

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,740
where people expect to have options and
choices in their lives where the threats

39
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:42,241
that,
uh,

40
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:44,860
affect the world are not necessarily
states to states,

41
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,870
but a bunch of people who can
communicate on the Internet and do a

42
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,780
great deal more damage than a general in
some country.

43
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:50,261
Can.
You know,

44
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:53,440
this is,
this is a whole new landscape and when

45
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,430
I'm coming around to the view that,
um,

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,180
it's too much to ask,
it's just too much to ask of a

47
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,560
generation,
uh,

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,810
born into a different world to govern in
this one.

49
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:04,570
I think the baby boom generation has
done what it can.

50
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,550
Uh,
um,

51
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,250
I,
I don't,

52
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,630
I don't,
I don't indict them as,

53
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,291
you know,
selfish,

54
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,300
worthless people.
I just think it's,

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,100
it may have been just too much to ask a
generation born in the 1950s to figure

56
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,220
out how to govern in the,
in the year 2007 or 2008.

57
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,060
And I,
I'm not,

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,020
I'm coming around to the view that
leadership and real leadership and real

59
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,820
change and real evolution of government,
we'll,

60
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:26,620
we'll have to wait for another
generation.
