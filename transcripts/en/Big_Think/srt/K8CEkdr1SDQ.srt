1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,420
All I have to say as I hope there is
such a thing as clean coal.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,410
And the reason I say that,
uh,

3
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:13,411
and of course that means that we can
burn coal and completely capture the co

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,540
two and then cause sequestered.
And it's certainly not an easy thing to

5
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:21,450
do.
But what I keep reminding people as a

6
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:24,810
kol is the world's most abundant energy
resources.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,290
Now you can argue whether it's as
abundant as solar or wind,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,030
but certainly in terms of conventional
resources and what people forget is that

9
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:37,050
coal employees,
literally tens of thousands of people

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,210
around the world,
not only in our own country,

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,080
but in places like India and China.
It is cheap.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,160
And so it's very difficult for emerging
market countries that are trying to

13
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,140
electrify to,
uh,

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,930
the grow their economies.
Uh,

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,180
economically it's very difficult for
them to simply say,

16
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,980
well,
we're going to stop using coal because

17
00:00:55,981 --> 00:01:00,060
of concerns about climate change because
not only will they throw thousands of

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,280
people out of work,
but they will not then,

19
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,640
and probably in the near term,
have a readily available alternative,

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,980
uh,
to replace the coal generated

21
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:08,640
electricity.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,540
That's leading to these explosive,
uh,

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,720
levels of economic growth.
So I hope that we put a lot of research

24
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,770
and development.
Uh,

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,820
uh,
there are essentially three major ways

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,280
that we think about right now to,
uh,

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,100
to potentially have clean call.
One involves taking the coo to help me

28
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:31,770
for combustion and to capturing it after
combustion.

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,150
But I would like to see us cooperate
with the other big coal users and

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,250
Indonesia and China,
India,

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,960
and maybe jointly embark on some
research and development projects using

32
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,090
these three technologies.
And,

33
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,730
uh,
not see it as a commercial gain of one

34
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:50,010
country is going to learn how to do it,
not other,

35
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:50,990
but,
but Santa,

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,880
the rubric of the global good that we
all do it together.

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,160
And then your share the benefits
accordingly.
