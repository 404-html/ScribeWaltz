1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,643
Mm.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,510
So I've been asked choosing an
amendment,

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,030
uh,
that I think is important and valuable.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,750
And so I think the first amendment,
and it's not only because it's the first

5
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:17,090
amendment,
it's what it says and it says,

6
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:21,320
Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion or prohibiting

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:26,321
the free exercise thereof or abridging
the freedom of speech or of the press or

8
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,530
the right of the people peaceably to
assemble and to petition the government

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,790
for a redress of grievances.
And I think from the constitution,

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,090
this sets up the rest of the
constitution about what it means to be

11
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:42,950
an American citizen and the value of our
individual liberties because it sets us

12
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:46,400
apart as individuals.
We have the right to speech,

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,700
we have the right to association,
we have the right to religion,

14
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,500
we can think,
we can act,

15
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,980
we can associate freely.
And as a scholar of international

16
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,860
relations,
when you poll people around the world

17
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:02,000
and they ask us,
what is it that you think is most

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,840
important about the United States that
you think sets the United States apart?

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,650
More often than not,
people point to the first amendment.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,440
And to the freedom of speech,
the freedom of assembly,

21
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,930
the freedom of religion.
Um,

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,590
as first and foremost what makes the
United States special,

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,000
that we privilege individuals as
citizens and our constitution protects

24
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,850
that we need to keep that in mind as
citizens.

25
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:30,020
And I have to tell you around the world,
people acknowledge that and respect that

26
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:33,290
about the United States.
You know,

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,680
I really have a hard time with this.
I so,

28
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:40,460
so this idea of freedom of assembly and
freedom of speech,

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,270
regardless of the nature of that speech.
I mean there are exceptions to that

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,720
about whether it propagates violence or
potentially promulgates violence.

31
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,570
Um,
and I tend to come down on the liberal

32
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:55,571
side that people should have freedom of
speech and that as you know,

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,170
defender of the,
you know,

34
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:00,880
the first amendment of the constitution
that then you need to redouble your

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,060
efforts to make sure that there's,
if you fear that this is going to lead

36
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:07,880
to violence,
a conflict that you redouble your

37
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:11,180
efforts and have police and you make
arrests and you said you've overstepped

38
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,800
your boundaries.
So I tend to be somebody,

39
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,830
let them assemble.
Let them have their freedom of speech

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,240
and redouble your efforts and take
measures to ensure that that can happen.
