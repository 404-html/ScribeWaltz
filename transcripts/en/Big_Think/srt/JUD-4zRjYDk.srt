1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,400
Well,
science is a very,

2
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:13,720
it's actually very difficult field
because you need probably above

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,850
everything else extraordinary patients.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:17,980
Okay.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,980
And what keeps you going is discovery.
And sometimes,

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,350
uh,
in a lifetime you may have one

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,950
outstanding discovery.
Um,

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,540
Einstein used to say that,
that he was unusual in that he had had

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,920
too,
but any one would have been enough to

10
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,580
have kept him going.
Um,

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,500
most scientists are not in that league,
but we all have at some scale,

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,310
uh,
things that were know,

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,660
really very proud of.
If we do,

14
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,810
if we discover them,
um,

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,660
often we are looking for them.

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,250
Okay.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,980
Uh,
the idea that a lot of discovery is

18
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,981
serendipitous and accidental is
tremendously,

19
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,890
tremendously overplayed.
Uh,

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,330
I think it's much more likely that once
see something almost in everyday life

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,870
that puzzles you and you carry it around
with you for some period of time and

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,920
then you see some way of connecting to
it.

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,500
Okay.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
Uh,
you could say our discoveries and autism

25
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,850
is an example of that.
At a very early age.

26
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:28,851
I was impressed by this child and later
saw an opportunity and I struck when the

27
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:31,590
opportunity was there to satisfy my
curiosity.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So most discoveries of that tough.
Sometimes you see things that you can't

29
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,720
explain and action say sometimes a lot
of time you see things that you can't

30
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,460
explain.
Um,

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,480
and sometimes you come up with
explanations that are really exciting

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,440
and 99% of the time those are wrong.
And it's really some trivial explanation

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,850
to the thing that's gotten you excited.
Early in my career I used to hate those

34
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,250
things and I used to say,
you know,

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,370
you know,
only a manic depressive would love

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
living like this.
You know,

37
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,580
you have,
you have,

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,150
you see something,
it's weird.

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,060
You have,
you come up with some great encompassing

40
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,120
idea that'll explain it.
It's going to change how people think

41
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,060
and then the next day you realize that
you were really a dumb ass.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,730
Nowadays when those things happen,
I actually really enjoy them because

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,730
there are so few,
you know,

44
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:30,780
real Eureka moments in one's life that
you have to almost enjoy the fake ones.

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,621
I mean,
after all,

46
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,240
it's it.
The feeling is just as good.

47
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,660
Yeah.

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,500
So I've actually gotten to enjoy those,
those weird results that we can't

49
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,080
explain.
Um,

50
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,910
come up with fanciful ideas and then try
to batter them,

51
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,210
and then you get a double satisfaction
because you end up destroying the idea.

52
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:48,890
And it's satisfying I

53
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,880
to destroy the idea almost as much fun
to destroy an idea's too as to create

54
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,060
one.
