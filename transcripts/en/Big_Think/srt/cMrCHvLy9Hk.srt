1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,480
Billing errors almost invariably are to
our disadvantage.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,050
It's so stunning.
One feels so blessed.

3
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:12,910
One feels so Leprechaun pod of Goldie
defines a billing error in our favor

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,640
that the temptation to take advantage of
it.

5
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,160
It's pretty potent but don't yield to
it.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,450
Here's the essential point.
It's not right to profit from someone

7
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:24,940
else's innocent error and in your own
life.

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,620
If you drop your wallet on the street,
you expect people to return it with the

9
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:33,400
cash in it.
Someone's innocent error is not meant to

10
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:37,930
be a profit making opportunity that we
have a kind of civic duty to play our

11
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,490
part,
to return the lost property,

12
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:42,430
to point out when the door to the bank
has been left ajar,

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,550
not to simply exploited.
I wouldn't want to live in that kind of

14
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,140
world.
So in this case,

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,830
you can't exploit an innocent air.
Even Time Warner's,

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,220
even though you may have harsh feelings
about a person or an entity,

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,690
you don't sacrifice your moral values
when you're dealing with him that his

18
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,450
good conduct doesn't just flow to
people.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,360
You regard as good people.
You have a set of ethical principles

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,390
that you apply to all people in all
circumstances.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,060
So in this case,
it means Time Warner has made an

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,360
innocent error by leaving you with the
de Luxe cable package,

23
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,220
even though you're paying for what I
believe they,

24
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:21,520
regardless of the cheapskate package,
I think that's how it's designated on my

25
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:24,160
bill.
You have to let them know now that the

26
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:25,870
second question becomes,
well,

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,070
how hard do you have to try to let them
know and you certainly don't have to

28
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:33,160
make it your life's work to inform
someone when they've made this kind of

29
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,900
error.
So one phone call.

30
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,130
Yes,
absolutely.

31
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,480
Two phone calls.
Yeah,

32
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,190
I'd say so.
That meets my standard.

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,310
After that,
I would send them a letter as much to

34
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,740
protect yourself.
Should you get receive a bill two years

35
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:47,530
from now for 24 months of the Lux cable
service.

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,650
But once you've made a good faith,
reasonable efforts,

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,100
and I realized these are ambiguous terms
to inform them about their air,

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,400
then they're on their own.
You do not have to make it your life's

39
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:02,401
work to correct time warner sloppiness.
The other aspect of this is these

40
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,900
exchanges,
these moral exchanges have to be

41
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,780
symmetrical.
That if you would want someone to tell

42
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:11,860
you that they have overcharged you,
then you have to tell them that they've

43
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,620
undercharged you.
Ethics must have parody.

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,700
Ethics must have symmetry for an ethical
proposition to be compelling.

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,810
It must seem fair no matter which seat
you're in.
