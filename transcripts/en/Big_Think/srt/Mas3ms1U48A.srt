1
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,590
Every every local car company in China
is working on hybrids.

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,210
I'm in fact going back to a point,
you know Toyota makes it Prius,

3
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,330
hybrid now in China,
260,000 RMB.

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,950
Chung on a local car company makes a
hybrid,

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,090
so 160,000 RMB,
not as good as that Prius.

6
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,910
I guarantee you 100,000 RMB.
Cheaper.

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,500
Every single local car company and local
car companies account for 30 percent now

8
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:43,560
the passenger car business agenda,
the truck and bus business almost

9
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,200
completely local.
Okay.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,520
There's no foreign company that has a
meaningful participation in that

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,370
commercial vehicle industry,
so there are a lot of local passenger

12
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,380
car companies,
trucking companies and so forth.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,280
These lending companies that are all
thinking about the environment,

14
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:04,140
everybody's working on programs to
improve the fuel efficiency and the

15
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:07,890
environmental impact.
I think that the whole thinking about

16
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,600
the environment in China's mind switched
seven years ago when they announced that

17
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,580
Beijing would get the 2008 Olympics.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,510
Think at that point,
every official in China realized that in

19
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,140
2008 for the first time,
millions of people coming to China and

20
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,060
they didn't want the environment to be
the big issue,

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,640
so there's a long way to go and believe
me,

22
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:31,641
China's got a huge environmental issue,
but the first step begins with thinking

23
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,790
differently about your.
I think that's already happened and so

24
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,650
everybody's conscious about it,
they're working on it.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,250
A guarantee.
I think a lot of the new innovations in,

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,260
for example,
in the auto industry,

27
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:45,120
are going to come out of China.
Why?

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,430
Because there's no single country in the
world as a bigger vested interest in

29
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,660
getting that done.
Then China,

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,740
China needs to grow to lift up those
neither 1 million people to grow.

31
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,940
It needs more transportation.
If the more transportation,

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,770
the more pollution.
If it can't make available that

33
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,990
transportation,
if that's a constraint on growth.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,170
So for China,
it's a matter of economic life and death

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,100
to find better ways to do it and that's
what I think is going to happen over the

36
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,810
next 10 years.
