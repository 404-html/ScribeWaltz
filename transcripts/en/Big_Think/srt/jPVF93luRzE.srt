1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,890
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,220
the short answer to that question
because

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,160
when I began writing this book,
I actually had had the,

4
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:17,994
uh,
the,

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,130
the word grown up idealist is a word
that had occurred to me for a long time

6
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,730
in thinking about Kant and indeed in
teaching count,

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,650
I've been teaching cottonelle wow.
Gosh,

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,940
uh,
let's see.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,490
For nearly 20 years,
uh,

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,400
on and off.
So when I was teaching college at Yale,

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:39,060
I used the word grownup idealist to
describe view viewers.

12
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,900
I've explained it to Barack Obama was
the first politician that I have ever

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,960
come across who I genuinely think has an
eye for both the way things are and the

14
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:54,141
way that things should be.
I think he embodies the American dream

15
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:58,340
in a way that we have not ever seen,
uh,

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,990
in a way that embodies both the
immigrant dream,

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,930
a sense of perspective about the rest of
the world,

18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,931
combined with a genuine appreciation of
the American dream.

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,000
And I think,
I think he's,

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,170
uh,
it's absolutely brilliant.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,460
Uh,
what convinced me about Barack Obama was

22
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:25,460
actually his first book,
dreams from my father.

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,600
And,
uh,

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,860
which is a book that I've been
recommending to people who then walk

25
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:31,880
away saying,
you know what,

26
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:35,210
even if he's not even,
he doesn't become president,

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,450
this is such a good book.
Anyone would've been proud to have

28
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:40,100
written it.
It's subtle,

29
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,880
it's reflective,
it's self reflective itself critical.

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,950
Um,
it's observant.

31
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:47,870
Then it's poetic.
Um,

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,770
all of which are reveal a sense of
character that I think we'll all be

33
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:03,851
proud to have in our next president.
And a final point that I have not seen

34
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:08,330
anybody raise about Obama is the
following.

35
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,300
Obama really does represent the triumph
of the civil rights movement.

36
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,060
There's racism in this country.
There is no question.

37
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:22,061
We've also seen it in the election and
electing Barack Obama will not get rid

38
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:25,790
of it,
although it will be a giant step

39
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,624
forward.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think one reason why so many people of
all ages are being inspired by Barack

41
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,800
Obama.
Is it the civil rights movement really

42
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,100
is a moment that Americans in our recent
history,

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
the American can be genuinely proud of.
It was a genuine moral,

44
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,660
morally political movement with all of
its frailties.

45
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,570
I just saw a terrific play called the
Good Negro,

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,390
a downtown which,
uh,

47
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,260
talks the frailties and the infighting
and all the things that happened in the

48
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:07,261
civil rights movement.
And yet it was a unique moment.

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,850
Uh,
we don't have an instance of that in

50
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,930
other countries.
I mean,

51
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,510
you have countries throwing off
colonialism,

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,780
but you don't have a moment in which a
country looked at its own ideals and

53
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,650
said,
hey,

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,890
we're not living up to them and it may
be bloody and painful and hard and

55
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,560
reluctant,
but we're going to change because we

56
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,230
know that we're not living up to the
standards that we set to ourselves.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
And I think a sense that this is,
this is,

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,660
this crystallizes something in America
to be proud of again,

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,200
is a perhaps what Michelle Obama meant
with her slightly,

60
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,270
um,
misspoken comments that I completely

61
00:03:55,271 --> 00:04:00,271
understand when my own teenagers who
look at politics completely skeptically

62
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:07,621
up to now see an interview with him on
television and come to me and had been

63
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:10,870
making fun of the grownups are being
excited for awhile.

64
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,930
My get it,
he's for real.

65
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,780
And if he's elected,
it will change the world.

66
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,600
And I have to say,
um,

67
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,550
Barack Obama has made in America an
offer we couldn't refuse.
