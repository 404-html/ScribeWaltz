1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,790
It was,
it was an incredible,

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,800
except it's a great experience actually.
Um,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,310
um,
I,

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,900
I sort of wandered into this,
into this business.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,820
I'm inadvertently,
I was in the book publishing business

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,683
and,
um,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,020
I started to publish books about
technology and about the Internet so

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:25,590
that I,
I was,

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,150
I,
I suppose I'm earlier than most,

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,970
um,
through this product that really had

11
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,850
nothing to do with the internet or
technology.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,540
Nevertheless,
being about those subjects introduced me

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,600
to this,
to this business.

14
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,480
And in New York I became sort of very
early,

15
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:50,160
one of the few people who had any claim
on knowing anything about this business,

16
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:54,120
although I'd like to footnote that I
really knew nothing at all.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,340
And um,
uh,

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,000
but as this business started to,
to um,

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,660
uh,
to heat up anybody who had any claim on

20
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:07,740
it was suddenly at the um,
um,

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,180
at center stage.

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,440
And,
um,

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,590
it was a opportunity knocking venture
capital came my way and I began to build

24
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,730
a company again having no idea,
um,

25
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,320
um,
um,

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,000
what kind of company I was building or
really any idea about the business in

27
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,010
which I was building this,
this,

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,300
um,
this company.

29
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:33,960
So this was truly learning on the job.
Um,

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,190
and,
um,

31
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,740
I,
I can only say in my defense that

32
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:42,690
virtually everybody who,
who was starting Internet businesses at

33
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,690
that point in time was also learning on
the job.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Um,
and,

35
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,770
um,
I,

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,370
and I,
I learned I'm not enough,

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,770
but,
um,

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,200
nobody in those days learned enough and,
um,

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,330
everyone,
virtually everyone went under and I went

40
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,750
under as well.
Um,

41
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,320
um,
I was in the fortunate position to be

42
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,220
able to,
um,

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,330
um,
to tell the story and I wrote a book

44
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,700
called burn rate and,
um,

45
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,410
um,
and that,

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,490
which I still think as serves as one of
the great cautionary tales of,

47
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,360
of the period.
But,

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,140
um,
um,

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,840
I,
I would do it again in a heartbeat.

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,920
I took certain steps when I,
when I started newser to ensure that,

51
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,300
um,
um,

52
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,360
that,
that,

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,300
that I,
I had gotten somewhat older and I didn't

54
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,250
think that I wouldn't necessarily be
able to,

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,310
my,
my system would be able to,

56
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,950
uh,
to tolerate the highs and lows of,

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,170
of the first experience in,
in the Internet.

58
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,920
So I went into newser with um,
um,

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,420
with a few safety measures.
Um,

60
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,880
my partner,
um,

61
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,970
in nooser is someone who absolutely
knows what he's doing,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,930
who has,
um,

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,070
uh,
started two successful companies.

64
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,580
I'm on the Internet.
He founded hoovers.com,

65
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,940
hadn't took that public and then sold
it,

66
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,610
Dun and Bradstreet,
and he started high beam,

67
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:25,900
which I'm an another news database
company which he sold.

68
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:30,901
So I feel in a remarkably good hands,
um,

69
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,040
the,
the editor and chief of news there is

70
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:33,874
also,
um,

71
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,950
um,
Caroline Miller,

72
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,070
who was the editor and chief of the New
York magazine,

73
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:40,510
credibly,
um,

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,270
um,
professional and,

75
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,410
and tenacious and accomplished woman.
So in reality,

76
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm at news or I do very little.
