1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,890
I never forget
asking a doctor,

2
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:12,860
oh,
he and I have a novelist once.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,670
Ed,
what do you think a new row c says?

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,200
An Eddie said,
it's the endless repetition of an

5
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:27,201
obsolete experience are failing.
And the trouble with age drives we get

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,140
as children
is there often

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
come about
for some emotional reason,

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,160
having to do okay with gang gaining our
parents love or respect or something.

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,230
And uh,
because it's not the real thing.

10
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,510
The real thing is just to be
spontaneously love,

11
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:01,920
not to have to go through this enormous
process.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,300
It,
it's air sacs.

13
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,200
It's artificial.
Okay.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,650
And You keep repeating it and repeating
it,

15
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,530
repeating it because it isn't real
somehow.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,910
So I think that's true in life.
I think sometimes,

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,160
okay,
when you develop they just neurotic

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,390
pattern Jew.
Okay.

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,010
You keep repeating these earlier
patterns,

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,000
uh,
often too.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Either no end at all or to an end that
has very little to do with the,

22
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,780
and you're really after,
right?

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,390
So I think it's important.
We're all strangers to our unconscious

24
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,224
to,
um,

25
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,610
try to go back and understand.
I'm not sure what we're doing.

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah.
Started decades and decades to go.

27
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,880
Yeah.
For reasons or motivations that have

28
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:02,560
very little to do with today and how
much of that is relevant and how much is

29
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:03,394
excessive.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,050
Okay.
