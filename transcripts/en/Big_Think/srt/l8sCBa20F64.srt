1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,600
I never thought of myself as one of the
first wave of women,

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,460
much of my career.
I thought that I've sort of been

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,670
following and the women who went ahead
of me in blazing the trails that made it

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,540
possible to do what I've done.
And this really is the first point in my

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,360
life where I've gotten to be the first
woman.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,130
I think a lot of the reason it happened
has a lot to do with Kellogg is um,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,180
has a lot to do also with the state of
where business education has gotten to

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,270
right now.
Women students come up to me and women

9
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,650
from many different areas come up and
say,

10
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,540
how did you get to be dean of Kellogg?
And I said,

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,430
well,
don't follow my model was the wrong

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,980
button.
Right?

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,560
You know,
hey,

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,630
I was a woman.
Be I was a social psychologist rather

15
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,500
than an economist.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,660
And See,
I just spent six years in undergraduate

17
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,360
business education.
And none of those have tended to be the

18
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,130
power alleys.
And yet,

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,640
what I think it tells us the fact that
Kellogg was ready to apply in a woman

20
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,760
and a top business school was,
is that the world has changed a lot.

21
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:57,150
There's a much deeper appreciation of
psychology in business school

22
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:59,160
environments in addition to economics.
You know,

23
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,950
that's something I knew was important
when I made the choice to study

24
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,600
psychology years ago.
Um,

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,450
but I think the world has certainly
embraced that view more so.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,990
It's an interesting thing that when you
look at graduate schools of business,

27
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,410
about 30 percent to 35 percent of the
students tend to be women.

28
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,550
And this is true.
What else?

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,380
You know,
it all top business schools through

30
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:23,070
every sort of sector of the business
school education domain.

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,490
Whereas if you look at law schools,
medical schools,

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,900
they tend to be about 50 percent women
and the feeder undergraduate programs at

33
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,060
colleges and research universities are
now,

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,190
most of them are at least 50 percent
women,

35
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:38,190
if not more.
This persistent fact that business

36
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:42,390
schools are lower is an interesting
question and people are just beginning

37
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:47,391
to get some data around it.
I recently read a study done by the

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,970
Simmons College and School of business
and it's finding there are negative

39
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:54,540
attitudes towards business of women in
the high school and the junior high

40
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,900
school years and they think that that
may be in part explaining why not as

41
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,330
many women are going to graduate schools
of business.

42
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,670
I still think it's a perplexing question
though,

43
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,870
because businesses such a dominant
institution in our society and so many

44
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,360
people are drawn to it.
It's the most popular undergraduate

45
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:12,570
major in the country.
So while I see the negative business

46
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,500
attitudes piece,
you know,

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,500
I keep wondering is that the whole
answer?

48
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:19,710
It's important data.
It's the cheapest degree.

49
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,850
It's only two years,
redmond,

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,050
three,
four or five.

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,060
So it truly is a perplexing question.
Part of it I wonder is if we haven't

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,180
misrepresented in some ways what you
learn at business school.

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,320
To me the greatest skill that you learn
is how to build effective organizations.

54
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,810
You learn about the markets and how they
work,

55
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,030
but you learn how to build effective
organizations,

56
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,880
which is how we as human beings
organize,

57
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,780
which is how we get things done.
And I think of we did a better job at

58
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,850
explaining to people that that's what
it's about.

59
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,560
I think that more women might be drawn
to it because women naturally organize

60
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,170
in their communities and our families,
uh,

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,920
in our churches and you know,
in all sorts of.

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,680
And I can't help wondering if we need to
get more enlightened language so people

63
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,470
truly understand that business school
really is about building effective

64
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:10,000
organizations within a market context.
But it can also be in a not for profit

65
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,890
context or a religious context.

66
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,370
I think it's just a question of time,
quite honestly,

67
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,330
in terms of the unique challenges to
women.

68
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,950
We've broken the glass ceilings now in
many places,

69
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:29,680
not maybe it is high numbers as some
people would have hoped,

70
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,740
but we've done it.
You know,

71
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:33,850
it's interesting that we broke the glass
ceiling of Harvard before we did have a

72
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,350
major business school,
for example.

73
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,510
Right.
We've broken the glass ceilings that a

74
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:41,230
lot of fortune 500 companies.
I recently had the privilege of being

75
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,770
asked to go to the fortune most powerful
women summit.

76
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,570
It was in Washington dc this past fall.
And the room was just packed with these

77
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,770
incredibly talented women and I looked
around and I found myself intimidated

78
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,080
and I realize people are intimidated by
what I've done.

79
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,240
I mean,
I think that we're doing it.

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,470
It's a question of choices for women
because it does require trade offs.

81
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,590
You don't get to have it all.
You can't have a perfect marriage,

82
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,570
perfect kids the perfect job and be in
perfect shape physically and I think

83
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:15,571
it's a question of tradeoffs and how far
women decided to go in the into business

84
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:16,800
I think will impart,
determined,

85
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,530
be determined by choices about child
rearing and the structure of the

86
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,920
American family and how do we decide to
allocate our resources.

87
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,520
Economics is the study of markets and
we'll.

88
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,710
Sociology also involves the study of
markets.

89
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,490
Many disciplines take an eye on them.
It's important to remember that all the

90
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:41,491
market is is a group of like
transactions and all the transaction is

91
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,890
as a buyer and seller getting together a
buyer saying,

92
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:48,520
I want that a seller saying,
I don't want it as much as you want it

93
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,240
because the price you're willing to give
me is higher than the price that I,

94
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:57,241
that I you know that I that I need to
keep it and that's the nature of human

95
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,600
commerce going all the way back to the
earliest days of human organizing and

96
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:08,350
understanding that all a market is an
aggregation of people selling and buying

97
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:13,351
similar things and that our models of
markets are just that they're models.

98
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:17,470
Supply and demand don't exist.
There.

99
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,480
A model of what we see in everyday life
that help us understand everyday life.

100
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,140
When we add you're great.
All those buyer and seller transactions

101
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:31,141
together and helping students understand
how human society functions,

102
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,900
how it naturally self organizes,
which is what a market is,

103
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:39,600
is what a free market economy is.
Because even in the socialist economies

104
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:42,190
and the communists,
those markets existed.

105
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,070
They made my,
maybe weren't tracked officially,

106
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,960
but they were there and they were
operating.

107
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,140
And so when I think about how we bring
that into education,

108
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,470
it's how do we help students understand
how humans organize,

109
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,540
how,
who humans interact and bring value to

110
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,870
each other.
I Love Adam Smith calls it about our

111
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,460
propensity to truck.
Now obviously I never thought of that as

112
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,700
a verb.
Um,

113
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,001
and,
and,

114
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:08,690
and had meaning back then,
but I love that phrase now.

115
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,550
Our propensity to truck is what makes us
different from the,

116
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,140
the animals,
our propensity to engage in transactions

117
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:20,090
of me to sell you something and you to
buy it so that I don't,

118
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,460
you know,
you'll do the farming and I'll do the

119
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,090
sewing.

120
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,020
And by having this propensity to truck
will each have more wellbeing in our

121
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,110
lives.
It's a very simple principle and I

122
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,020
sometimes think that when we use words
like markets and networks,

123
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,450
things we create an abstraction of
reality.

124
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,480
These are models of how we exist
because I look out at the world and I

125
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:48,221
see what creates wealth and business by
the way for me is organizations and

126
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:53,000
markets which are both important parts
of it and it's organization's operating,

127
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,130
eating as actors in markets.
Um,

128
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,460
and I look out at the world and I
watched.

129
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,440
It's not the government that's creating
jobs.

130
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,870
It's not the governance that's creating
innovation.

131
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,740
It's not the church that's doing it.
It's not,

132
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:09,080
you know,
you can get something done so much

133
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:12,770
faster with a for profit business than
you can with a not for profit or a

134
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:17,771
government or a religious based business
or even an NGO and you can move jobs and

135
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,740
move wealth and solve problems so much
faster.

136
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,070
It's pretty obvious.
It's the dominant social institution.

137
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,760
Now,
do I like that every day?

138
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:29,960
No,
because sometimes as it's become the

139
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:34,961
dominant social institution,
we've allowed market based logics to

140
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,260
dominate our thinking.
I'm part of how did 2008 occurred?

141
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,150
How did it all your classmates get?
Lord,

142
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,780
as you talked about to Wall Street is
because money has become even more

143
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,680
motivating to us in the age of the
business as the dominant social

144
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:53,681
institution and money is only a metric.
Money is only one place of value in life

145
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,440
and if there's a sort of a challenge
that we're going to have,

146
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:01,610
if we're going to recalibrate,
it's going to be as a human on a psyche

147
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,820
level,
understanding how much business has come

148
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:09,170
to dominate and homogenized and control
culture in some cases and making

149
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,990
conscious decisions about where we're
going to let that happen and where we're

150
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,570
not.
Um,

151
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,150
right now we're dealing with the
unintended consequences of business

152
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,260
emerging as the dominant social
institution and we're beginning to have

153
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:25,100
dialogues about how do we push that
monetary metric back a little to let

154
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,510
other values on the table.

155
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,270
As a society,
both nationally and globally,

156
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,480
markets aren't fair or unfair.
Markets create wealth and they're

157
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,481
incredibly efficient at allocating goods
and resources and creating surplus for

158
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:43,670
society.
That makes people better off,

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,950
but markets have nothing to do with how
that wellbeing gets allocated across

160
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,910
members of society.
And you can't argue they're fair or

161
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,320
unfair,
they're agnostic there,

162
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,870
a moral,
not immoral,

163
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,260
amoral.
It's we as human beings who get to

164
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:06,261
decide how much each person should be
entitled to on a moral and values based

165
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,910
level.
And I personally am somebody who

166
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,550
believes the I,
the fact that a billion out of the 6

167
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,470
billion of us on the planet live on
what?

168
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,471
Less than a dollar a day isn't fair.
And I don't believe that markets can

169
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:23,040
solve it.
I do believe they can create more wealth

170
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,630
to spread,
to help solve it.

171
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,860
But if we just allow markets unchecked
and somehow argued that will take care

172
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,500
of it.
I've seen no data to indicate that

173
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,860
markets will know because they aren't
knowing.

174
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,720
They're allocating their generative,
not loving.

175
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Clearly the service sector is where we
excel on the US economy versus the

176
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,900
manufacturing.
Uh,

177
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:52,080
and so clearly that's going to be and
the knowledge based sectors because

178
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,700
that's where we have still have a leg up
in the world in higher education and

179
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,010
people who come out with critical
thinking skills.

180
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,260
So clearly those pieces are going to
lead.

181
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,470
Finance is already playing a bigger role
than any of us thought it would,

182
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,200
but I personally,
in terms of sort of hopes and dreams,

183
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:11,700
I think that social enterprise is having
more on a small scale,

184
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,150
but there's more vigor in that than I
would have guessed five or 10 years ago

185
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:20,151
and that excites me
for the foreseeable future.

186
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,270
The service sector has eclipsed
manufacturing and a lot of it's a simple

187
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,470
cost argument.
We cannot manufacturer as economically

188
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,780
in the United States as you can in
developing countries because all kinds

189
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,390
of tax reasons,
benefit reasons and things that we

190
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,790
require and are good for society.

191
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,180
The interesting thing about economics
and markets and the developing the

192
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,840
developed world as we've never played
out this game before at a global scale.

193
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,760
We don't know if there is long term harm
to losing a manufacturing base.

194
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,560
Intuitively it feels very uncomfortable.
It's unclear where certain sectors of

195
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,780
our society are going to continue to
find employment.

196
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:04,710
When you drive through Detroit,
it's absolutely scary in some situations

197
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:08,220
are cities like buffalo that used to
have these manufacturing basis,

198
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,010
so I would argue we don't know the
answer to that,

199
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,080
but I'm not sure we can fix it right now
until people are willing to not look for

200
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:19,530
the lowest cost on certain manufactured
goods.

201
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:24,000
The developed world will win out or the
developing world as a job space for

202
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:28,830
manufacturing will win out over the
developed world and in order for that to

203
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,310
change,
we'd have to change how we buy and how

204
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:36,450
we consume and it's hard to foresee in
the near future how that's going to

205
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,284
change.

206
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,240
So in many ways I don't know that we
have a choice.

207
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,220
We have to play it out and see what
happens.

208
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,160
The beautiful thing is the Internet.
For example,

209
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,310
we didn't even know about it 20 years
ago,

210
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,480
even 15,
nobody thought it was going to circle

211
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:50,820
the globe as fast as it did.
There's so many,

212
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,470
you know,
and that's where you get your hope and

213
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:56,770
sense of surprise is there may well be
things that are going to happen that we

214
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,650
can't even imagine that make this
service dominated,

215
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,230
developed economy,
just fondling.

216
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,190
And what we have to do when I get back
to education is keep educating the

217
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:10,660
thinkers and the innovators and the
critiquers who will help those

218
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:14,590
breakthroughs come to bear because
that's the only hope for human society.

219
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,320
Because at some point the developing
world will have played out this chain as

220
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,130
well.
Um,

221
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,910
and we'll,
we'll have robots manufacturing

222
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,430
everything basic.
And the question is,

223
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,600
what is human life?
Then?

224
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,460
What is the marketplace?
Then?

225
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:31,480
How do we find meaning and value and get
our needs met and feed our families.
