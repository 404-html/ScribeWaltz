1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,040
Yeah,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,910
president of American grand strategy
basically says nuclear weapons could

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:15,620
only be possessed by countries that we
like and they cannot be possessed by cut

4
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:18,770
trees we don't like.
So if Katrina's we don't like try and

5
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:21,530
get nuclear weapons,
we will move heaven and earth to stop

6
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,570
the.
That's the basic story.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,410
I was a codicil to that.
We basically would prefer that no other

8
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,590
countries get nuclear weapons either
because it just complicates our lives

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,380
right now.
In a perfect world,

10
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:37,070
it would be nice if there were no other
nuclear weapons states except the United

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,230
States right there.
There were already several other nuclear

12
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,670
weapons states other than the United
States.

13
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,010
We've learned how to live with other
nuclear weapons states.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,630
Right,
and if you look at the kinds of policies

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:52,631
than it takes to keep other powers from
doing in their national security

16
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:58,040
interests inside their own border with
their own money,

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,660
what it is they conceive as being
necessary for their national security to

18
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:07,640
try and dictate to them what they can
and cannot do is a big job and you need

19
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,770
a hedgematic position to be able to do
with that.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,040
You need decisive,
crushing military superiority,

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,470
and you may even need to be able to
invade them right,

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,750
and if you look at the arguments about
Iran and about North Korea as they've

23
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,540
unfolded over the last 10 years and as
are being discussed today,

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,960
right?
The question lurking in the background

25
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:34,961
all the time is if you can't get them to
negotiate away these capabilities,

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,220
which they seem to want for their own
reasons,

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,910
you should be willing to fight a
preventive war,

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,290
not a preemptive war,
not attacking them before they attack

29
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,080
you when you think they're getting ready
to attack you,

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,000
but attacking them now because you think
there might be a problem later and you'd

31
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:03,500
rather not deal with it.
So you're going to have war now to avoid

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,440
some kind of war later.
Right,

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,930
and that seems pretty good if the war is
cheap,

34
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,720
but the wars are not cheap,
right?

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,830
Because rubbing out another country's
nuclear weapons is turns out to be a big

36
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,470
job.
You've got to destroy factories,

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,010
laboratories.
You've got to wreck their economy.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,400
You've got to keep the economy squeeze.
You have to kill people or get or kidnap

39
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,540
them,
scientists,

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,280
engineers,
right?

41
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:36,281
If you want to prevent a moderately
technologically advanced country,

42
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:38,060
and here we're talking about North
Korea,

43
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:42,770
which is really nothing special from
getting this old technology of nuclear

44
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,270
weapons.
It's no an old technology.

45
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,830
It's not a mystery,
right?

46
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,080
You really need to be able to to,
to get your,

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,520
your hands around their neck and squeeze
it and keep squeezing.

48
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,590
Right?
So the question is,

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
how many times with how many places are
you willing to do this?

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,390
How often are you willing to wage
preventive wars?

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,360
How many countries do you want to be at?
A constant,

52
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,410
this kind of relationship with,
right?

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,820
These are the questions you have to ask
to help.

54
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,100
If we had an.
I'd like to have an honest debate about

55
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,300
this.
The United States,

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,800
right?
I don't even think we have an honest

57
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,460
debate because the way,
the way the debate has happened is it

58
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,170
will be very bad if they got nuclear
weapons.

59
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,410
We have to do something about it.
All options are on the table.

60
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:31,120
What kind of euphemism is all options
are on the table wars on the table?

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,680
Well,
what kind of wars on the table?

62
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,070
How many wars are on the table?
What are the likelihood of success?

63
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,840
What are the unintended consequences of
war to prevent nuclear proliferation?

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,940
All right.
These are questions we should debate.

65
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,230
We should ask.
We should answer right now.

66
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,020
My problem with nuclear weapons is
rather different.

67
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,800
I believe that America knows how to
deter countries to have nuclear weapons.

68
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,890
Countries that have nuclear weapons are
not going to attack the United States

69
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,900
because if they do,
we're going to annihilate them.

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,350
It will be very sad for us.
It will be even sadder for them,

71
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,560
right?
They're mostly small nuclear powers.

72
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,230
We are graded large nuclear power,
right?

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,240
The whole thing would be very,
very,

74
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:14,200
very sad and tragic and it's easy for
the other side to know how tragic it's

75
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,810
going to be because our nuclear forces
are not a secret,

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,440
right?
We have 1500 warheads on a variety of

77
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:24,940
delivery systems and we can wreck pretty
much any country in the world,

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,060
right?
That's the residual of our Cold War

79
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:32,630
force and we are getting ready to spend
a trillion dollars modernizing that for

80
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:37,631
us to keep it tip top shape.
I think deterrence we can do so.

81
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,780
What do I worry about?
I worry about not nuclear weapons in the

82
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,270
hands of states,
but nuclear weapons that are not in the

83
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:44,200
hands of states.

84
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,110
I worry about nuclear weapons that are
lost.

85
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,750
Nuclear weapons that are stolen,
nuclear weapons that are Adelaide,

86
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,390
right?
Nuclear weapons that are sold off the

87
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,860
back of trucks.
Right?

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,160
So what do you do about that?
Well,

89
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,420
people who believe in the
nonproliferation story will say,

90
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,130
well,
this is just another reason to prevent

91
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,720
more states from getting nuclear
weapons.

92
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,290
I said,
yes,

93
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,690
but what about all the states that
already have nuclear weapons,

94
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,070
including some that I'm guessing don't
really have very great can really

95
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:16,090
terrific controls.
So my view is our nuclear

96
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,340
nonproliferation proliferation policies
directed at the wrong thing and the

97
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,640
problem,
but we want to do is make sure that

98
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:23,980
nuclear weapons are in the hands of
states,

99
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,240
remain in the hands of states,
any state that has nuclear weapons.

100
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:33,130
We should be talking to them about best
practices to ensure that nobody sells.

101
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,680
Nobody steals,
nobody loses.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,540
Nobody breaks.
Right?

103
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,760
This,
this requires a lot of application,

104
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,380
a lot of organization,
right you to be a responsible nuclear

105
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,010
power is hard work.
It took us a long time to learn how to

106
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,580
do it right.
We've actually in the past taught others

107
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,030
how to do it.
This should be the thing that we focus

108
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,680
on in the world from the nuclear weapons
problem,

109
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,780
right?
Because once nuclear weapons are not in

110
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,320
the hands of states,
in the hands of individuals or groups,

111
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,460
then deterrence becomes hard because a
rev,

112
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,560
a radical group,
a terrorist group,

113
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,680
a millennial group,
and I don't mean the generation,

114
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:17,510
I mean people who imagined some magic
moment where history is going to be

115
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,860
transformed,
right?

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,881
They,
they,

117
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:20,960
you can't deter.
You got,

118
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,590
they've got nothing that they value that
you can threaten or retaliate against.

119
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,100
Countries have many things they value
that you can threaten to tolerate

120
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,190
against.
These groups may have nothing to you can

121
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,620
retaliate against,
so it's very important to keep nuclear

122
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,670
weapons out of their hands.
