00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,010
I think the fact that there can be this
exponential warping and it has this

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,430
really dramatic implications.
It's pretty important.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,820
It's important for the reason that I
just said which is that it might explain

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:20,480
why mass gales are different.
It could be relevant for other places

5
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:23,480
where you'd want different math skills
such as inflationary cosmology,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,920
but we also found something else that
was very interesting that you could

7
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:32,921
actually have an infinite dimension of
space that's an extra dimension of

8
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:36,960
fourth measure of space that you don't
see and this was really radical in a

9
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,940
sense that since the basically
physicists always thought that if you

10
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,430
head extra dimensions,
they had to be tiny because we don't see

11
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:44,960
them.
It's pretty intuitive.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,820
If something's really small you don't
see it,

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,020
and so the idea that you had very curled
up or finite sized extra dimensions and

14
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:54,290
that was basically what people thought
was essential for us not to see them.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,150
It turns out that this strong warping
that we discovered could also mean that

16
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:02,690
gravity is so concentrated that you
don't see it an extra dimension of

17
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:05,300
space.
So that could have radical implications.

18
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:05,930
Obviously for it.
