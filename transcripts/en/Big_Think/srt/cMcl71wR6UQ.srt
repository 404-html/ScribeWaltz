1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
It means a lot.
It definitely means a lot.

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,150
Um,
because

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,540
I think there were so many people

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,900
who doubted that it would actually
happen.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,650
There are so many people who said get,
that's cool,

6
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,990
but it's not going to happen or he's
gonna get assassinated.

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,561
Or,
I mean,

8
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:36,530
I was watching the Nike Aeration and
watching him getting sworn in.

9
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,930
I was like,
as there's going to be the shot now,

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,880
like I was so scared.
And so it meant so much,

11
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:47,750
I think to our generation and I'm
coining our generation generation.

12
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:52,751
Why not?
Because I think that he exemplified all

13
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:57,770
the possibilities of what you can do if
you just believe and try hard enough.

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,750
He is the most
relevant.

15
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:07,310
How ratio augers story that we have had
in this country in a long time.

16
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:12,311
And you know,
for young people,

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,990
especially young people of color,
who

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,260
didn't think that that was possible,
that meant a lot.

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,660
And I think that that motivated so many
of us,

20
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,340
and there's a series of events that have
motivated our generation to be one of

21
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,900
the greatest generations since the great
depression generation.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
I like one of those was hurricane
Katrina,

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,370
one of those was having a Dick in the
Office for eight years who hung out with

24
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,050
a Bush.
Um,

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,913
and then

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,700
after that it was getting to that point
of so much frustration that the audacity

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,530
that we actually had the audacity to go
outside of our box and elect a young

28
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,230
African American president.
And that is what's redefining our

29
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:05,890
generation.
And not only just the economic

30
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:09,310
situation,
but I think that

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,010
we were so complacent during Bush's
term.

32
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:22,011
We were so overwhelmed by how ridiculous
it was that we didn't feel like we can

33
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:27,351
do anything about it.
And Obama's when shows that we can,

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,970
if we put our minds to it.
And

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,770
I think that's what it meant to me the
most,

36
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,550
is that it was very motivating of my own
personal.
