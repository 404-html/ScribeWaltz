1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,780
I think if you are a true food lover,
you are a healthy eater.

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,643
Well,
first of all,

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,800
the term Foodie is completely ridiculous
because for someone,

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,500
when you meet somebody and they say,
I really love to eat.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,530
I think the appropriate answer is who
doesn't?

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,080
So I mean,
look around.

7
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,850
Who's you know,
who's not a food lover?

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:33,010
Everybody's a food lover.
The question is,

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,520
do we responsibly do eat for your own
benefit to you?

10
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,700
We fear planets benefit and do you eat
the best food possible?

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,400
If the answer to all of those things is
yes,

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,860
then you're eating well.
If you're eating,

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,620
you know if your style of eating is bad
for your body,

14
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:50,230
if your style of eating it's bad for the
planet,

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,240
then you are not really eating good
food.

16
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:54,340
You're eating lousy food and there's,
as we know,

17
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,341
there's plenty of lousy food around
the principled,

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,720
the principled way to eat.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,770
If you were going to say,
I want to eat entirely for my own

20
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,200
benefit,
I want to eat entirely for the benefit

21
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,810
of the planet.
I want to eat in the most responsible

22
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:15,350
way possible to minimize my carbon
footprint,

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,440
to minimize my impact overall,
to minimize my effect on animals.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,470
You would be a Vegan.
That's the bottom line.

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,560
The veganism is the most principled way
to eat.

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,440
That there is from the perspective of
your own body,

27
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,290
from the perspective of the planet,
from the perspective of animals.

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,410
Very few people are going to be vegans.
Let's be real.

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,190
So,
um,

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,610
what's next?
I mean,

31
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,170
on the one hand you have vegans and on
the other hand you have people who eat

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,010
whatever they feel like eating.
There's a middle ground.

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,550
The problem with the way most Americans
eat right now is that we are about as

34
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:58,010
far from veganism as we could be.

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,010
So if Egan would get 100% of his or her
calories from plants,

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,620
most Americans get 90% of their calories
from processed food,

37
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,820
junk food,
and animal products.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,300
So the goal,
I think is to move in the direction of

39
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:20,060
eating more unprocessed plant food than
we do now.

40
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,220
And everybody's got a different starting
place.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,340
If you eat 20 cheeseburgers a week or
the equivalent,

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,970
you might look at eating 15
cheeseburgers or weak or the equivalent.

43
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,660
If you're eating 15 you might look at
eating 10 and so on.

44
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,320
And I think if people think about what's
best for their body,

45
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:39,710
what's best for the planet,
the answer is eating unprocessed plant

46
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:44,711
food and then think about how can I eat
more of that stuff at the expense of me,

47
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,403
which was,
you know,

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,230
which was the question.
But also at the expensive processed food

49
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,064
and junk food.

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,980
The idea is to eat as many of them
processed plants as you can.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,990
What are plants,
plants or vegetables,

52
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:03,010
fruits,
legumes,

53
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,170
which means beans,
nuts and seeds.

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,140
Um,
what am I leaving out?

55
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,360
I think that's about it.
So the,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,520
the idea is to eat as many unprocessed
plants as you possibly can and to eat

57
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,130
those instead of eating processed foods,
junk foods,

58
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,620
and animal products.
What works for me,

59
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,730
what's worked for me for just about
three years now.

60
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:32,650
It works for me is to eat very,
very strict diet of plants only and

61
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,710
unprocessed plants only from the time I
wake up in the morning until dinner

62
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:40,420
time,
so from the time I wake up until roughly

63
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,940
dark,
I eat a lot of fruit.

64
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:47,170
I eat a lot of vegetables,
I eat some whole grains and sometimes I

65
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,120
have some beans and that's pretty much
it.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,510
And then at night I eat whatever I want
and that's the,

67
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:57,130
which includes meat and which includes
wine and which includes pasta and bread

68
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,070
and stuff like that.
That's a huge change for me.

69
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,920
I think that if you think of your diet
as a seesaw with the,

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,700
you know the animal products,
the process through the junk food on the

71
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:11,200
heavy side as it is for most people and
the unprocessed plants on the light side

72
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,390
as it is for most people.
I think for me,

73
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:17,860
my cso went from looking something like
this to looking something like this.

74
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,860
I think that to the extent other people
can eat that way,

75
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,861
they will have a,
have a lesser impact on the planet,

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,720
improve their health,
probably lose weight,

77
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,793
feel better.

78
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,500
Think I just saw it.
It changed the way because if some of

79
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:39,790
the things we've been talking about
here,

80
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,480
one is that I,
I recognize that um,

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,790
one of the highest contributors to
greenhouse gases and global warming is

82
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,070
the,
is the industrial production of

83
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,420
livestock.
So I decided,

84
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,490
okay,
that was one good reason to eat less

85
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,040
meat.
The other good reasons he lets me is

86
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,550
that I was in my mid fifties and my
health wasn't what it used to be.

87
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,800
So I was overweight,
I had bad knees,

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,120
I had sleep apnea,
I had high cholesterol,

89
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,850
I had high blood sugar or borderline
high blood sugar.

90
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,160
I think that's enough.
So,

91
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,070
um,
I decided

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,860
to change my diet and it's,
it's so obvious to everyone who pays any

93
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,400
attention to nutrition at all,
that if you want to be healthier,

94
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,190
the way to do that is,
you know,

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,530
as I've already said,
is to eat fewer animal products and eat

96
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,060
less processed and junk food.

97
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,000
So I started to do that and,
and it worked.

98
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,490
I lost 35 pounds,
um,

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,710
gained five of them back,
but hey,

100
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,540
uh,
slept,

101
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,760
sleep apnea went away.
I slept better,

102
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,120
my knees bothered me much less.
In fact,

103
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,860
I ran the New York marathon last year.
Um,

104
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,590
my cholesterol is back to normal and my
blood sugar is back to normal.

105
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,080
So it all worked.
And it's not a coincidence.

106
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,600
I mean,
no one would say it was a coincidence,

107
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,880
actually not.
Um,

108
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,630
there's some things I don't like,
but I think that it's important to

109
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,000
recognize that there's no sort of
single,

110
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,910
I mean,
arsenic and cyanide aside,

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,050
there's not really a single ingredient
that's going to outright kill you.

112
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:15,460
I mean,
there's actually some evidence that a

113
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:20,230
single can of soda can trigger diabetes,
but there's not a lot of eps evidence

114
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:22,090
about that.
In general.

115
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,750
One ingredient,
one little kind of food,

116
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,840
one one meal,
one day,

117
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,540
even one week.
That's not what's determinant of your

118
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,730
overall health or of your impact on the
planet.

119
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,270
What determines is your overall diet,
and if it's moving in the right

120
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,760
direction,
which for most Americans is towards

121
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,480
plants and away from animal products and
processed foods,

122
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,130
then I think,
you know,

123
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:45,551
hip,
hip,

124
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:46,260
hurray,
you're,

125
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,590
you know,
that's the way to go.
