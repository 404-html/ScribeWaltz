1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,560
In my life as a professional engaged in
the business of education,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
I frequently find myself involved in
conversations about college and career

3
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,880
readiness.
Almost always that phrase,

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,881
college and Career Readiness Precedes a
conversation between two people,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,560
both of whom went to college,
a particular kind of college even,

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,310
and the conversation is usually about
college.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,300
I think our society hasn't been serious
enough about the career part of that

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,410
equation.
There is a presumption among some people

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,950
that the body of knowledge necessary to
be ready for college level work and the

10
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:50,991
body of knowledge necessary to enter a
career with prospects for promotion are

11
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,710
exactly the same.
I believe that there are students,

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,850
in fact,
the vast majority of students whose

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,500
education after high school will look
nothing like mine.

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,530
I left my public high school in South
Carolina and moved to Massachusetts and

15
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:15,270
went to an ivy league university and
spent four years there,

16
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,460
graduated and went on with my career.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
That is now an unusual experience to a
ridiculous extent except among education

18
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:28,410
policy people.
They're going to be many more students

19
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:33,411
who leave high school and go directly to
work and start on a path of learning

20
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:38,460
from work that's going to lead in very
different directions.

21
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:43,110
Then my career has led and I don't
believe that we have done enough at the

22
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:48,111
policy level to explore what those
different pathways might look like and

23
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:52,050
if you ask employers,
industry leaders,

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,410
they tend to agree with me on that.
We're not thinking enough about middle

25
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,960
skill jobs.
We're not thinking enough about

26
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:05,961
technical jobs below the level of
engineer and I think our society and

27
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:10,770
it's policy makers really need to pay
some careful attention to that.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Probably if if and when we start to pay
attention,

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,720
we will come upon the tragic absence of
apprenticeships in our American society

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,750
in Europe as many as a quarter to a half
of any group of teenagers at any any

31
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:37,671
point is pursuing an apprenticeship,
which means that they're getting both

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
academic training and work training
while being paid by an employer.

33
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,030
They are learning on the job to pursue a
particular career and that can be an

34
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,660
apprenticeship in software development.
It can be a PR,

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,510
an apprenticeship in hotel management.
It can be an apprenticeship in any

36
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:02,511
number of things in the states.
We have shamefully convinced most high

37
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,940
school students that they either need to
go to Harvard or they need to go to

38
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,320
Mcdonald's,
and the truth is significantly more

39
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:16,321
complicated than that in the middle of
where job growth growth is,

40
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,260
where there are jobs that are not being
filled today and too few people in our

41
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,430
public policy community are really
focused on what students who are going

42
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:31,210
to pursue a career as their pathway out
of poverty,

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,290
for example,
really need to be getting from their

44
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,990
education.
Really need to be getting from the

45
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:42,991
public policy people who are dedicated
to creating opportunities for them and

46
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:47,950
allowing them to pursue pathways that
look nothing like what we think is

47
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,784
traditional.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,590
Because the reality is the notion that
you go off to college,

49
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,220
live in a dorm,
go to some football games,

50
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:02,221
graduate in four years and go on with
your life is a persistent myth that has

51
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,860
very little to do with the lives of most
people.

52
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,590
Uh,
pursuing a degree after high school

53
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,890
right now,
and the sooner we get to the point that

54
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:16,060
we take the career side of the college
and career readiness equation,

55
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,680
much more seriously,
the better off our society will be.

56
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,790
The fewer young people we will have who
were in a position of not being in

57
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:29,350
school or at work.
And the better off we will be in terms

58
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:34,351
of filling existing jobs,
requiring high levels of skills for

59
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,050
which there are no employees that.
