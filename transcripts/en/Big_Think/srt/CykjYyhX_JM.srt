1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,760
Well,
I never really thought of the media was

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,230
some kind of bullying.
Something has changed.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,900
I mean the media now is so diverse and
so complex and there's so much of it,

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,030
you know,
you can find problems with

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,440
anything I suppose,
but the fact of the matter is a lot of

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:29,270
media today isn't targeted to me a
reason to target with any person in

7
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,580
particular.
They look for certain market segments

8
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:34,250
and they go for them and they really
don't care anything about anybody else

9
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:37,060
or what anybody else thinks.
And uh,

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,740
you know,
professionally I was part of that

11
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,290
process for a long time.
But I do believe today if you're an

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,340
active,
involved,

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,230
educated,
thoughtful person,

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,680
you can find a mix of media that appeals
to you,

15
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,540
satisfies you more readily and better
than any point in time in history.

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,430
So you can say,
oh my God,

17
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:57,500
the media,
they're so exploitative.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,150
They lean towards a sensational thing or
they don't have enough international

19
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:04,760
news coverage.
But you know,

20
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,740
it's your decision what you want to
watch.

21
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:10,100
And there's just so many other options.
I really have a hard time feeling sorry

22
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,690
for anybody who has that point of view.
