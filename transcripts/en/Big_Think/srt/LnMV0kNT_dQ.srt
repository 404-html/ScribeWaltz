1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,080
What I'm talking about is something that
will take a generation to do what I need

2
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:20,200
to start there is that if we're looking
for a healthcare fix for something as

3
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,940
complex,
uh,

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,043
with,
with,

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,570
with the previous choices we've made in
healthcare,

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,820
that's going to have a fundamental
impact on our system.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,560
It's hopeless to too many of us depend
on the current forms of financing.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,610
I have spent our whole lives
participating in it for an instantaneous

9
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:38,620
change and frankly the whole healthcare
industry,

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,390
which is almost a fifth of our economy,
has been set up with an existing system.

11
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:46,240
So the first thing you need is a
generation commitment.

12
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,970
I,
it's taken roughly 50 years to create

13
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:51,340
this mess.
You're not going to solve it in 12.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,730
You're really gonna have to be committed
to fundamental change over time.

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,150
That's a very hard thing for our,
or frankly any political system to do

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,880
other than accidentally we did it
accidentally with Medicare and Medicaid

17
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,440
and,
and company funded insurance to do it

18
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,530
intentionally as much harder,
but that,

19
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,170
that's number one.

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,450
It's just a realistic sense of what it's
going to take.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,960
Beyond that.
I think there are really three important

22
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,910
elements.
Number One,

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,380
I believe,
uh,

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,190
and I think many Americans do that there
really does need to be a true cradle to

25
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:25,060
grave safety net for all Americans for
catastrophic health,

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,470
which is really the initial starting
point of many of these debates in some

27
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,540
cases over a hundred years ago in the
developed world.

28
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,520
We still don't have that and I think I
think at two,

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,390
one will be up to near two and a half
trillion dollars of spending next year.

30
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,770
The number one question we need to ask
ourselves is how on earth do we spend

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,100
two and a half trillion dollars on
healthcare a year and not have a true

32
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:50,290
safety net for health catastrophes?
For All Americans?

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,740
That's number one.
And to me what that's about is

34
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:54,970
catastrophic insurance.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,740
It actually is an insurable good.
Unlike so much of what is uninsured and

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,180
healthcare,
and I start there and it needs to be a

37
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:04,120
national pool because we can't get into
the situation.

38
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:08,830
We see now when we have private
insurance insurers competing for profit

39
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:13,000
growth in part on how successful they
are on underwriting out the worst cases.

40
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,380
We can't just let the public pay for the
worst cases.

41
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,690
It's actually an extraordinarily
inflationary approach to creating an

42
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,040
insurance.
But we need a national poll.

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,000
Beyond that though,
we have to look at funding non

44
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:28,480
catastrophic care,
which does include late life care

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,640
because it's plannable,
right?

46
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,360
Unlike most insurance events,
it's,

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,200
it's something that we can plan during
our life and that we do fund during our

48
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,160
life,
uh,

49
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:40,090
but also a lot of disease management
issues and frankly a lot of routine care

50
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,340
in the ways we fund other things in our
economy.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,470
How do we do that?
We do that out of income,

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,440
out of savings,
out of credit against future savings.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,760
And so what I would like to see over
time is a shift in the enormous

54
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:55,720
resources that we currently pay to
support the insurance system back to

55
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:58,750
consumers to allow them both to fund
their current,

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,070
uh,
medical expenses and save for future.

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Once it has a couple of benefits.
Benefit number one is it returns us to

58
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,750
our role as consumers.
Uh,

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,240
it,
it,

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,180
it,
it does something.

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,240
We have to start with one,
I think now,

62
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,850
uh,
indisputable fact,

63
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,390
which is our 50 year reliance on
employers and insurers on governments to

64
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,410
control costs have failed,
right?

65
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,980
W W we will hear endless details of how
we can do it better in this odd,

66
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,870
this new regulation will finally do it.
But if you follow the last 50 years of

67
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,970
healthcare,
we've tried a lot of different things

68
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,050
that Medicare,
medicaid,

69
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,700
and private insurance and that theory,
that big will exercise,

70
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,100
leverage and leverage will keep prices
down.

71
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,340
You know,
if 50 years of the past experience

72
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,630
hasn't taught us,
that doesn't work,

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,820
then I guess we'll need more years.
But I,

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
I at least not many others believe at
some point you say,

75
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,330
okay,
this doesn't work.

76
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:56,320
What will.
Well,

77
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,650
the one thing we really haven't tried is
to do what works everywhere else,

78
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,780
which is to have a mass of desegregated
thinking consumers,

79
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,700
uh,
pushing prices,

80
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,040
forcing quality,
forcing accountability.

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,990
That's number one.
I,

82
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,750
I do want to come back to criticisms
with that approach because I think

83
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,430
there's some important criticisms of
that approach,

84
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,320
but that is,
you know,

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,340
where I start the second is we have to
avoid the use it or lose it.

86
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:28,441
Approach to financing healthcare and
reliance on insurance and on government

87
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:32,890
programs means that every dollar we put
into the system is going to be spent on

88
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,100
healthcare.
If you think about an individual's own

89
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,120
life,
uh,

90
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,210
you save money for rainy days,
uh,

91
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,420
but if it doesn't rain,
you may not apply an umbrella.

92
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,910
The healthcare system doesn't quite work
that way,

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,530
right?
Once a lot of the money we take from

94
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,710
people to pay for insurance premiums,
medicare tax,

95
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,880
a medicare premiums down the road is in
case you need it.

96
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,390
But the very fact it's there means it
will be spent on healthcare.

97
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,240
Now from an individual's perspective,
that may seem irrelevant,

98
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,640
but from a society's perspective,
it's a real problem because at coming up

99
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,050
very soon or 20 percent of GDP,
the dollars we're spending on healthcare

100
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,150
are things we can't spend on.
The other good things in life,

101
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,170
and you may be aware of my article,
I talk about how we don't even know if

102
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:23,200
we're making the the expenditures that
are best for our health.

103
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,810
We just know we're making the
expenditures that provide the most

104
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,310
health care.
Those are different things.

105
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,080
Nobody can answer the question,
would we as a society be better off all

106
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,600
giving each ourselves another week
vacation?

107
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,030
We're spending another 150 billion on
healthcare.

108
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,250
They're almost treated differently,
but they're not different.

109
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:44,251
Of course we're at a point in our health
where over 50 percent of annual deaths

110
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,960
come from conditions or causes that have
more to do with lifestyle.

111
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,850
Uh,
this is of course heart disease,

112
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,440
diabetes,
accident,

113
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,460
suicide,
homicide.

114
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,300
Then they have to do with health care.
We've done a great job in healthcare to

115
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,430
get to that point.
But being at that point,

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,190
if we're interested in improving our
health,

117
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,220
we don't know that these investments are
better made in healthcare or all the

118
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,040
other aspects of health,
whether it's recreation or environment

119
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,580
or nutrition or what have you,
that are being crowded out by society's

120
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:19,120
decision to fund healthcare in a use it
or lose it way.

121
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,200
So this is less important for the
individual,

122
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,970
perhaps more important for us as a
society.

123
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,020
So what I'm seeking to do is I'm seeking
to say rather than look for a magic

124
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,340
bullet,
single way to finance health care,

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,700
which I think comes out of that early
misconception I talked about that

126
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:38,090
healthcare is sort of a lump emergency.
Need it,

127
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,890
we know what it is,
pay for it.

128
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,080
That's not true anymore.
It's much more complex than that.

129
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,190
We need to match the way we finance
healthcare to how we use it to what it

130
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,930
is.
There are emergencies that are

131
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,610
catastrophic.
Uh,

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,790
not all of us will have them.
It's completely appropriate for

133
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,920
insurance to finance them.
Insurance is actually the most efficient

134
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,740
way to finance them.
Insurance that the least efficient,

135
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,660
most costly,
most distorted way of financing

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,553
everything else.

137
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,710
The first one is just a financial one,
which is people saying,

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,380
I can't afford it.
I have enough trouble affording my

139
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:10,940
deductible.
And they are right.

140
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,800
The key to this is that generational
shift I talk about every year.

141
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,330
We need to reduce a bit our reliance on
insurance and take some of the resources

142
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,000
we use to pay those premiums and get
them to consumers.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,010
We need to gradually over a 20 year
period increased the deductible

144
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:31,310
insurance policies from what they are
now to general catastrophic.

145
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,230
What that will do is it will move more
healthcare resources to individuals,

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,660
uh,
enabling them to finance their care.

147
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,390
Now,
the only good news about spending two

148
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:44,420
and a half trillion dollars on
healthcare is that all of us,

149
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,350
and I mean all of us are spending an
incredible amount of money on care.

150
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,700
We may not be aware of it.

151
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,030
We may think somebody else is paying for
it.

152
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,300
That's an illusion.
You know,

153
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:59,090
one of things I looked at it in my
article was hire higher 23 year old

154
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:03,740
today and he spends his entire career
with my company and he has a spouse and

155
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:08,741
a couple of kids and a few years and
retires at 65 and lives to lady,

156
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,240
um,
and what would the amount of money that

157
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:17,780
goes into the system for that 23 year
old and started them at entry level

158
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,040
salary $30,000 a year,
uh,

159
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,960
which is roughly 60 percent of the
average household income in our country.

160
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,160
And had him grow that his income grow at
three percent over the course of his

161
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,270
life,
gets a salary,

162
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:34,271
have little over $100,000 by retires.
And I made an assumption which hasn't

163
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,160
been true for 50 years,
which is let's say the growth of all

164
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,070
healthcare is only equal to the growth
of income,

165
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,870
of course has been running one or two
points above income.

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,790
The amazing thing is that 23 year old is
looking at one point $7,

167
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:51,791
million dollars being spent on his or
her behalf to fund his household,

168
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,980
had medical care over their lives.
That's everything that's,

169
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
uh,
their own share of,

170
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,960
of,
uh,

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,900
health insurance,
their out of pocket.

172
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,240
Um,
uh,

173
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,990
their medicare premiums when they're
seniors,

174
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,530
the stuff that they actually see,
but it's also the stuff they don't see

175
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,150
what their employer paid on their
behalf.

176
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,360
The Medicare tax that came out.
Um,

177
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,820
and uh,
um,

178
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,410
uh,
what's interesting is I realized later

179
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:23,160
that I understated it because I didn't
include the amount of general tax

180
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,080
revenues that subsidizing our
healthcare,

181
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,730
which is another big bite.
But let's,

182
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,240
let's forget that for a moment.
I think if you said to the average 23

183
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,610
year old,
you want to participate in this

184
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,370
insurance system,
or you want a million dollars over your

185
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:38,070
life to spend on your own care,
and if you don't spend it on your own

186
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:38,904
care,
uh,

187
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,840
you can put it away.

188
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,520
The only thing I'm,
I ask you to do is I'm going to insist

189
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,040
you buy catastrophic insurance.
I don't think there's any question what

190
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,600
the average 23 year old and say now you
say an average 23 year old may not be

191
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,330
smart enough to make that decision or
longterm,

192
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,330
but let's look at the impact on
everybody in this country have a

193
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:59,331
healthcare system that costs the average
employer who pays insurance 12 grand a

194
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:04,260
year per employee 12 grand.
So if you're earning the average income

195
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,030
in this country,
$50,000,

196
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,300
your employer is paying $62,000 was
forget about social security tax and

197
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,980
Medicare tax,
a moment for the privilege of employing

198
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,940
you and you're getting only 50 grand.
That is an extraordinary aggressive tax.

199
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,800
The interesting thing is if you
transferred that 12 grand to the average

200
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,400
family,
they could buy catastrophic care for the

201
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:28,830
whole family and have a significant
amount of money,

202
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,290
leftover savings,
the health savings account or per year.

203
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,610
So you have to be willing to do both.
You have to be willing to reduce the

204
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:38,400
coverage of insurance,
but transfer those resources to

205
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:42,690
individuals and if you're not willing to
do both and people would be afraid that

206
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,241
you are.
Of course,

207
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,360
the you can't have a consumer driven
system.

208
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,020
The second concern I think a lot of
people have is consumers aren't wise

209
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:54,021
enough or smart enough or capable of
driving pricing and quality in our

210
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:59,331
healthcare system,
and I think as a lot of fundamental

211
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,660
reforms have to deal with that seems to
be comparing a proposed new approach was

212
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,870
something that doesn't exist today.
Consumers make all the decisions on

213
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:09,000
their healthcare today.
Not the negative ones,

214
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,940
but you can't.
You can't treat somebody without their

215
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:14,190
choosing the treatment without they're
agreeing to the treatment.

216
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,290
I'm not proposing getting rid of
doctors.

217
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,100
I'm not saying let's take the
professionals who advise you now out of

218
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:23,160
the system and you design your own
treatment and find someone to do it.

219
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,580
What I'm saying is right now we have a
system where doctors advise a patients

220
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,540
make the ultimate decisions subject to
insurance company via.

221
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,290
I am removing the insurance company from
that equation,

222
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,050
but I don't think that most consumers
would say,

223
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
well,
that puts me in a terrible position.

224
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:45,870
I rely on my insurance company to help
me through my life self care decisions

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,150
there.
There's another thing that I think again

226
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,130
comes out of the island nature of health
care.

227
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,420
Very few of us are true active
comparative shoppers and everything we

228
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,120
buy.
We all benefit from the existence of

229
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,940
Walmart,
whether we shop there or have ever in

230
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,560
our lives compare the price of
toothpaste.

231
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,820
What happens in a consumer driven
economy isn't that every consumer after

232
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:10,200
getting hit by the bus,
goes to the Internet and calls up a

233
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,670
emergency surgeons to see who to hire
and at what price.

234
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,290
What happens is is you benefit from the
fact that the entire structure of

235
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,430
providers is altered to attract
consumers as opposed to serve insurers

236
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,670
and governments.
That's the.

237
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,070
That's the dynamic I'm trying to capture
in a consumer centric approach.

238
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,280
That dynamic of providers who answer to
us patient consumers and not to

239
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,800
intermediaries,
and if you spend time in a hospital

240
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,800
watching a patient be treated,
not for a second,

241
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,980
can you forget that that patient isn't
the customer of that hospital.

242
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,500
Can't forget it.
You see it in the care in almost every

243
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:48,700
element of the care and if you've been
in the rest of our economy and bought

244
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,020
anything in the rest of the economy,
you know,

245
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,920
that's true.
Nowhere else.

246
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,450
And that's a crucial thing.

247
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,690
I'm not sure there are,
there are many.

248
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,470
Um,
I think some of the objectives,

249
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,310
uh,
that we've talked about today are things

250
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:11,311
that people are increasingly aware may
matter a in resolving this sort of trap

251
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:14,380
we're in,
of ever reducing access ever lower

252
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,740
quality and ever higher prices.
I think one of them is there's an

253
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:22,741
awareness that a lack of competition and
a lack of price transparency makes it

254
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:27,350
difficult for consumers to exercise,
um,

255
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,880
any of the disciplinary force they do in
most other industries.

256
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,730
There's been a movement in some states,
certainly for greater price

257
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:37,090
transparency.
Unfortunately it's not true price

258
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:40,930
transparency is list price and of course
hospitals don't charge this price for

259
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,610
anything.
Um,

260
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,460
so it's been fairly meaningless,
but it's a step.

261
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,620
It's an understanding of,
of the right direction.

262
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,720
One of the interesting things that's
occurring,

263
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,440
and we've seen it occur and other
government programs as well,

264
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,250
is that there is the beginnings of
something of a shadow economy and

265
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,890
healthcare for people who are outside
the system,

266
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,410
uh,
for many of those who either don't have

267
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,620
access to health insurance or can't
afford health insurance.

268
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,860
Um,
there is increasingly a cash and credit

269
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,110
based economy around health care
services.

270
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,250
There are parts of this country you can
drive around and see services advertised

271
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,540
on billboards on a cash only basis.
Um,

272
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,100
you obviously see some of these clinics
that have opened in walmarts and cvs is,

273
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,100
they'd get at one of the,
uh,

274
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,420
you know,
one of the things you would expect to

275
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:29,950
see in a more consumer oriented system,
which has real value services,

276
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,960
uh,
for some of the less complex,

277
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,300
a more easy to replicate a treatment,
uh,

278
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,760
possibilities such as it is many in
primary care.

279
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,280
Um,
but I think we have to be,

280
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,870
we have to be candid about the walls
around the political process.

281
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:51,620
Now,
the reality is most Americans are happy

282
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:54,530
with their health insurance.
And I think some pulsate it's 55 or 60

283
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,370
percent,
uh,

284
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,620
and probably a percentage of those who
have health insurance,

285
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,440
it may even be higher and as long as
that's the case,

286
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,100
we're not going to expect any politician
to propose fundamental reform.

287
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,230
They can't.
There are enormous interest groups,

288
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,310
uh,
that existed in the,

289
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:10,910
in the provision of healthcare,
um,

290
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,970
who would be opposed to anything that
negative that affects the status quo

291
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:16,010
negatively from them.
And obviously anything we had real

292
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:19,160
discipline on price would negatively
affect the status quo for these interest

293
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,590
groups.
No politician's going to buck that for a

294
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:26,480
public that believes it's got a good
deal at 55 or 60 percent approval.

295
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
You can't go at the fundamental of the
system.

296
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,510
One of the things that I,
I mentioned in my article and the

297
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:40,160
reasons I spent a lot of time on numbers
is that I think this is actually an

298
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:43,160
illusion.
I think much of healthcare policy has

299
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,970
been about perpetuating this illusion
that somebody else's magically paying

300
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:48,470
for your care.
Uh,

301
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:52,580
one of things I talk about is a very
common among my fellow liberals is to

302
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,301
say,
well,

303
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,510
if we eliminated advertising and we
eliminated the profit motive in order

304
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,880
things I mentioned in my,
in my articles,

305
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:01,760
if you confiscated the profits of every
single American company,

306
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,360
forget about the drug companies and the,
and the hospital companies and the

307
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,850
device manufacture.
Just take every prophet,

308
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,250
every dollar of profit in the American
economy.

309
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,660
You'd pay for something like four or
five months of our healthcare in two and

310
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,100
a half trillion dollars.
We're not there yet.

311
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
We'll be there next year.
I think the number of this year is

312
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,790
likely to be somewhere between two,
three to four,

313
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,180
but two and a half trillion dollars.
The only people who can pay for

314
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,640
healthcare is all of us and we're all
paying for an enormous amounts,

315
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:31,610
right?
You hear people talk all the time.

316
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,260
And I,
one of the reasons I,

317
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:34,890
I,
I,

318
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,560
uh,
have so few friends left,

319
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,810
is one of the things I do at dinner
parties is talk about,

320
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,780
I asked people to mention a healthcare
bill I have and I break it down,

321
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,500
what do you think the costs of that are?
But you'll see a $5,000 bill for

322
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:48,500
something that probably had five or $600
and marginal cost,

323
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,900
uh,
and you'll recognize just how

324
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:54,680
extraordinary the inflation is,
but you'll also recognize that what your

325
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,130
friend was worried about was the three
or $400 they had to pay against it.

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,230
And,
um,

327
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,450
you know,
the difference in that is costing us all

328
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:04,520
a fortune.
The moment at which everybody says,

329
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:08,480
you know,
it's kind of like having a credit card.

330
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,390
I can go out and buy a $2,000 plasma
television,

331
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,090
not pay for it at that moment and tell
myself,

332
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,190
hey,
this plasma tv costs me nothing.

333
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,950
It's the damn credit card bill.
It's costing me a fortune.

334
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,940
That's what we've done in healthcare.
Um,

335
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,690
and unfortunately we have divided the
funding among so many different places,

336
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,160
right?
Ourselves.

337
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,540
Um,
our,

338
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,000
uh,
our employer in many cases,

339
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,540
various targeted taxes,
the government general revenues that

340
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,770
people don't sit there and say,
wow,

341
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,730
the average middle class family is
probably looking at 20,

342
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:47,630
30 percent of their income,
somebody somewhere taking out and paying

343
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,190
for healthcare.
That's extraordinarily regressive.

344
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,320
And I think if there's awareness of that
or when there's awareness of that and it

345
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:58,350
may take more time and more spending and
more afraid,

346
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,160
safety net and frankly more people
suffering and being hurt,

347
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,020
uh,
for us to get the realization that there

348
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:08,130
is no free ride in healthcare,
it's costing us a fortune and we're all

349
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,110
being hurt by the lack of discipline in
the system.

350
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,890
I think only then you'll look at the
true fundamental reform being

351
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:17,790
politically possible for politicians to
take the enormous political risk of

352
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,470
saying to some of the interest groups in
health care.

353
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,450
I'm sorry,
but the pie hasn't been.

354
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:21,560
Again.
