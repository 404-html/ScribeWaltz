1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,370
Ms,
perhaps the first or second day.

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,620
And my brother had been elected to the
congress and he asked me whether I

3
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,430
wanted a tour of,
of,

4
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:24,220
of Washington.
And I welcomed the,

5
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:27,190
uh,
the opportunity and he brought me around

6
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:32,191
to the House of Representatives and
brought me to the United States Senate,

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,280
brought me over to the Supreme Court of
the United States,

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,440
pointed out the White House along with
those magnificent monuments,

9
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,090
the Lincoln,
but Washington monument.

10
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:45,520
But he gave advice to me then,
which,

11
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:46,720
uh,
really,

12
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,501
uh,
stuck with me.

13
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:51,280
I was
probably 12 years old at the,

14
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,120
uh,
at the time,

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,680
and he said to look,
you'll,

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,740
you'll visit the buildings now.
You'll see these buildings.

17
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,560
That'd be,
but he said that the really importance

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:03,730
of this visit is that you take an
interest in what is happens inside these

19
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,760
buildings,
uh,

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,460
for the rest of your life.
And I thought,

21
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,440
well,
that's a nice sort of idea,

22
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,280
but,
uh,

23
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:09,831
you know,
when,

24
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,250
uh,
when are we going to get hot dogs or

25
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:15,370
something or other,
or go to a baseball or a football game.

26
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:19,030
But the resonance of that message,
uh,

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,260
stayed with me,
uh,

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,111
with me,
uh,

29
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:22,270
all of my life.
And,

30
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:23,070
uh,
uh,

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,460
it was good advice at that time.
And it's advice I share with a,

32
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:30,220
when young people come from a
Massachusetts,

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
uh,
and visit the,

34
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:32,381
uh,
the capital,

35
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,760
it's,
it's the way,

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,020
uh,
only way really our democracy is going

37
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:41,021
to work is if people take the interest,
take the time involved themselves in

38
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,261
the,
the,

39
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,430
the political life of our country.
It's enormously.
