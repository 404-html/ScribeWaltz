1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,340
I suppose I'm an opinion maker.
I publish a lot.

2
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,460
I give a lot of speeches.
Uh,

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,010
I try to analyze things,
provide leadership.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,200
I don't do it within an organization.
The university has been a base for me to

5
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:26,010
do it to the outside.
I spend a lot of time abroad.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,480
I think it's very important for
Americans to do that now because our

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,500
role in the world is so confused at this
point in time.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,490
So I think,
uh,

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,850
by writing and teaching,
I'm an opinion makers.

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,960
I think they're very important.
I've,

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,210
I'm a generalist in a world is full of
specialist.

12
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm a generalist.
I've caught in a number of different

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,550
disciplines.
I know a great deal about a lot of

14
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,200
subjects.
Uh,

15
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:06,830
I have tried to focus on big questions
in the sub.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,570
I've tried intentionally to be a
generalist and that's unusual in the

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,990
modern world and a lot of people are
very suspicious of that,

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,010
but I think it's very important for
somebody to try to figure out how the

19
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:23,150
whole thing fits together.
And I think the lack of that is a real

20
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:27,080
problem that we have.
So I think the most important thing I've

21
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:32,081
done is to try to be a generalist and to
provide some leadership and some

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,060
perspective in that.
