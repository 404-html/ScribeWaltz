1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,520
The idea at the end of the Cold War.
And it started with George Hw Bush and

2
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:14,521
then continued with Bill Clinton was
what George Hw Bush called it a Europe

3
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,740
whole and free Clinton called it a
peaceful,

4
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:21,670
undivided democratic Europe.
The idea was let's take advantage of the

5
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:26,410
end of the Cold War to remove the
division in Europe and bring the former

6
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:31,000
communist part of Europe into the rest,
integrate it into the rest of Europe.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,900
And there was,
you know,

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,040
there was the effort with central and
eastern Europe to bring those new

9
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,460
democracies in there where the wars in
the Balkans,

10
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:44,770
in Bosnia and Kosovo,
uh,

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,420
to try to end the repression that was
being carried out by the government in

12
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:51,050
Serbia,
uh,

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,680
to try to move you,
the former Yugoslavia onto a different

14
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,830
path.
And the Russia part was related to this,

15
00:00:56,831 --> 00:01:00,220
trying to bring Russia closer as well.
But especially on NATO,

16
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:05,221
the idea was that the United States
could use this alliance to help anchor

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,970
countries like Poland and Hungary and
others in central and eastern Europe

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,290
into the West.

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,090
Because basically what NATO said to
those countries was if you can develop

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,450
democracy and markets and respect for
human rights and and respect for borders

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,090
that you can join this organization but
you have to carry out internal reforms

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,020
in order to join NATO.
And it was hugely important for the

23
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:39,070
stability of central and eastern Europe
and a huge success story after the Cold

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,070
War that these young democracies did it,
I mean they built democ democratic

25
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:49,470
market oriented states,
protected human rights and you know,

26
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,630
agreed that they weren't going to change
borders and it,

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,510
because there were a lot of,
a lot of issues from how those borders

28
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:59,350
had been drawn decades before that
people were worried about him.

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,011
You know,
for example,

30
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:01,660
Hungary and Romania,
you know,

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
worked out their issues and these
countries were able to join NATO,

32
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:12,730
which gave the European Union more
confidence about the stability in that

33
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:15,940
part of Europe,
which enabled those countries in 2004 to

34
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:19,360
join the European Union,
which you know,

35
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,280
has really been in terms of the American
effort to promote democracy after the

36
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,114
end of the Cold War.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,410
Central Eastern Europe really is one of
the huge success stories.

38
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,990
It's also,
uh,

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
should have been sort of a cautionary
tale about what was required because a

40
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:41,401
lot of the people in the George h w Bush
administration in the period of 89 to 91

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,060
who were there when central Eastern
Europe started on this path saw and in

42
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:50,500
central and eastern Europe,
you know,

43
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:54,370
the bad guys were toppled.
Statues were pulled down and the

44
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,670
populations really wanted to join the
west.

45
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,180
And when these guys are end after 2001,
they're looking at Iraq and they're

46
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,220
thinking about it the way they saw
things in central and eastern Europe.

47
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,210
You get rid of the regime and you're
topless statues and the population

48
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,450
welcomes you as liberator's and wants to
join the west.

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,020
And they really took the wrong,
less,

50
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,880
I mean,
less than a central eastern Europe was

51
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:22,510
how much assistance was required,
how much,

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,900
how important it was that you had
institutions like NATO and the European

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,560
Union that could help bring these
countries in,

54
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:30,640
in these countries,
really saw themselves as,

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,810
as part of the West,
and that they had been denied that by

56
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,610
the Cold War.
And,

57
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,260
uh,
you know,

58
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,810
things didn't turn out that way in a
raft.

59
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,080
[inaudible].
