1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,550
You know,
history has tended to move people toward

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,910
mutual acceptance.
You might say,

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,050
you know,
in other words,

4
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,340
the moral compass has expanded,
uh,

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,720
over time.
If you compare us to the time back when

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:25,630
people in one hunter gatherer village
thought the people in the next village

7
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,250
or subhuman,
um,

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,600
that doesn't mean that continued
progress is,

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,590
is guaranteed.
Okay.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,080
What is,
what is guaranteed?

11
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,030
And this is what's interesting to me and
this is,

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,690
this is what leads me to think that
it's,

13
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,040
it's not crazy to say that,
uh,

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,060
there's some larger purpose with a moral
dimension unfolding through human

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:51,761
history.
What,

16
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:56,761
What's interesting to me is that the way
history seems seems to kind of be set

17
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:58,240
up,
although I know set up is kind of a

18
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:02,080
biased a term because I'm,
I'm not sure that any anybody or things

19
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:03,160
set it up.
But,

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,660
um,
the,

21
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:09,661
uh,
the way the system works is that if

22
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:13,360
people don't make the moral progress,
they pay a price.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
Okay.
So right now in the history of the

24
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:18,100
world,
if people in the different abrahamic

25
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,240
faiths,
Islam,

26
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:20,470
Judaism,
Christianity,

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,590
don't get better at accepting one
another,

28
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:27,280
don't get better at tolerance,
it can be really bad for the world on an

29
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:28,570
epic scale.
You know,

30
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,290
it could be,
we can be talking about the collapse of

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,330
the society and,
uh,

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,610
I think this is built into the system
and we've seen it time and time and time

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,960
again,
that history forces people to either

34
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:47,380
expand their moral compass or pay the
price.

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,190
And so all I can say for sure is that,
uh,

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,520
for pretty sure is that,
that I think the salvation of the world

37
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:56,620
in the sense of just holding the system
together.

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,990
You know,
having some degree of peace and order,

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,220
uh,
depends on further moral progress.

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,670
Uh,
that doesn't mean that the outcome will

41
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:07,390
be good.

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,220
But it's interesting to me that,
that the system drives,

43
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:15,970
drives us toward this point where we
either make the moral progress or we pay

44
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,140
the price.
So,

45
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,360
uh,
and this is actually reminiscent of

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,130
something that various biblical prophets
were kind of saying in one sense or

47
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:26,200
another.
And not just biblical prophets.

48
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,400
I mean,
I would say,

49
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,301
uh,
Mohammed,

50
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,460
I would say abrahamic prophets in
general.

51
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,810
A common message is to say that,
uh,

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,660
salvation is possible.
So long as you align yourself more

53
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,970
closely with the moral axis of the
universe.

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,680
Now usually these profits,
they didn't use the term moral access to

55
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,630
the universe.
Of course they use the term God,

56
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:52,540
but they did think of God as the moral
axis of the universe.

57
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:56,260
And I would say that even now,
even if you're secular,

58
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,910
uh,
you,

59
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,240
you,
you can still that the salvation of the

60
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,090
world and this concrete sense of holding
it together,

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,170
um,
is going to depend on humanity,

62
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,230
aligning it self more closely with the
moral axis,

63
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,560
uh,
of the universe.

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,510
If you agree with me that that access
involves things like,

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,380
uh,
acceptance of people who are different

66
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,270
from you and,
and overcoming,

67
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,130
you know,
prejudices and biases.

68
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:24,610
And so on.
