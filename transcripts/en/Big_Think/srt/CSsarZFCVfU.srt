1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,600
If there is a single force as a
biologist,

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,880
I would have to begin with the force of
evolution.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,170
Uh,
clearly,

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,790
uh,
I believe in evolution.

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,780
I believe in the,
in the theory of natural selection.

6
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:23,430
I think it's had an enormous impact on
who we are as a species and where we are

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,340
today.
Um,

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,470
I believe in the power of technology.
I think particularly if you look at the

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:38,331
history of human endeavor,
you could write that history based on

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,330
the kinds of technological advances we
know from the bronze age on the first

11
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,590
time someone picked up a stick and
realized it could be a tool,

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,390
uh,
to what is happening today in,

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,500
with the Internet,
for example.

14
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,070
I think that has been a tremendous,
tremendous,

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
uh,
force,

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,760
uh,
that has affected the way we have

17
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,770
developed as a species.
Um,

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
I think the other would be the move away
from subsistence to creating excess,

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,660
which is another way of saying,
uh,

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,430
the ability to move from living hand to
mouth to find the leak creating wealth

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,520
than what wealth allowed individuals to
do,

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,570
uh,
both in terms of creating a greater

23
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,010
comfort in the way we live.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,040
But I think also in allowing us to
leisure time that allows us as humans to

25
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,680
create art,
for example.

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,550
I think the great force in higher
education in the United States has been

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,700
a,
is really been several things actually,

28
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:56,090
now that I think about it.
The first I think was the commitment

29
00:01:56,091 --> 00:02:01,091
really from the very beginning of this
country to free public education.

30
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,830
Um,
that I think was a revolutionary idea in

31
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,750
some respects.
And I think it is one that has served

32
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,590
the country very well until relatively
recent times.

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,210
And I think if I have one concern about
how that is now playing out today in

34
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,210
2007,
uh,

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,230
I worry about the enormous difference in
the quality of the very best and the

36
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:31,430
very worst of our public schools in this
country.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,740
Uh,
the gap between what happens in

38
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:38,480
Princeton high school and what happens
in the high schools in Trenton,

39
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:41,870
which are just 20 miles away,
are night and day.

40
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,620
And I worry about the degree to which
are striving for free public education

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,600
has really been diminished in this
country.

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,760
Uh,
I think the same thing could be true

43
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,070
about great state universities.
They,

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,100
they were created a so that at every
individual capable of doing work at the

45
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,700
university level,
what have an opportunity to go to

46
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,200
college.
Uh,

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,540
as those state colleges and universities
are being financially squeezed by their

48
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,380
state legislatures,
they have only one choice and that is to

49
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,780
raise tuition.
And as they've raised tuition,

50
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,260
those state colleges and universities
become less and less accessible to those

51
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,610
who are in the bottom of the income
bracket.
