1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,650
Everything worth doing in life,
learn to ride a bike,

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,630
learning to walk.
When I was a kid,

3
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,850
learning to walk,
I fell and cracked my skull,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
but I needed to learn to walk,
taking a test,

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,520
getting married,
getting a driver's license.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,420
All of those things,
they give you an improved capability or

7
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,260
an improved richness in life,
but they all come with a degree of risk

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,640
that is exaggerated.
If the thing that you want to do is fly

9
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,520
a rocket ship,
rocket ships are dangerous there.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,670
It's a controlled explosion.
If you drew a cartoon of a rocket,

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,430
what it would be?
Would it be a bomb with six seats on the

12
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,264
top?
I mean,

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,200
rocket ships are crazy dangerous on the
first flight of the space shuttle.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,130
When Bob Crippen and John Young,
we're sitting there back in 1981 and

15
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,660
they blast it off out of Florida.
Now that we go back and we look at what

16
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,060
the actual history of the space shuttle
was,

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,290
their odds of dying that day in the
first eight and a half minutes were one

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,124
in nine.

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,800
Terrible odds.
One in nine.

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,550
I mean,
look around you and had 10 people and

21
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,750
realize that just to try that one and
nine times they would have died.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,670
They got away with it and we learned a
lot from it,

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,540
but even when I flew on my first shuttle
flight on the 74th shuttle flight,

24
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,760
we'd learned enough things.
We'd improved it,

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,470
but the odds of dying that day for my
crew were still one in 38,

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,500
which is no insurance company would be
happy with.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,860
It's hard to get life insurance as an
astronaut actually.

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,310
But.
But the question you really need to ask

29
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,460
that is,
do I want to learn to walk?

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,760
Do I want to ride this bike?
Do I want to get married?

31
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:46,170
Do I want to learn to drive a car?
What risks are worth taking in my life?

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,630
Because even if you decide,
okay,

33
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,820
I'm going to take no risk,
I'm going to stay at home and hide under

34
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:51,570
my pillow.

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,810
There's still risk with that and you're
still gonna die eventually anyway.

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,540
So it's kind of a measure of what was
worth doing in your life and therefore

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,500
what was worth taking a risk for.
Once you've got that behind you and

38
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,334
said,
okay,

39
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm going to be an astronaut,
I'm going to fly a rocket ship.

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,470
That's a risk I'm going to take now.
It changes your whole job.

41
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,700
Your job is not to be afraid.
Your job is not to be,

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,150
uh,
an incompetent nervous passenger.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,190
Your job now is to defeat the risk.
Like when you learn to ride a bike,

44
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,560
if you just stay as a passenger in the
bike,

45
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,350
you're never gonna know what to do with
the handlebars and you're never going to

46
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,380
master riding a bike.
And once you can ride a bike,

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,280
you know you've got a freedom you never
had before and rocket ships or just the

48
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,114
same.

49
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,710
You have to decide what risks are worth
taking and then start changing who you

50
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,930
are,
learning how to turn the handlebars so

51
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:50,010
that you could make this thing do
something that otherwise might hurt you

52
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,070
or kill you.
And then once you've got that done,

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,430
it can take you to places and give you a
richness in your life that you never

54
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,060
would have had access any other way.
And,

55
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,890
and in my case,
when you make it through that launch,

56
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,100
when you've guided that rocket up
through the atmosphere and the engine

57
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:10,630
shut off,
suddenly you're in the rarest of human

58
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,570
experiences.
You're weightless and the world is

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,600
pouring by at five miles a second,
and you can see across an entire

60
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,670
continent and,
and your,

61
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,970
your piering into something that is
brand new for humanity.

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,640
So,
uh,

63
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,880
I think it's worth asking yourself what
risks are worth taking.

64
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,080
And once you've decided to take them,
then change who you are so that you can,

65
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,470
when you can defeat,
you can master that thing and open a

66
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,870
door for yourself that otherwise was
just shut.
