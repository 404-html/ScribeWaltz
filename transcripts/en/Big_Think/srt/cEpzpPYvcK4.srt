1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,150
Well,
I think there are lots of things that

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,170
that can be taught.
So,

3
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:13,670
um,
you know,

4
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,220
the ultimate that it's a very good
question.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,480
Uh,
but it,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,260
what is true is that in the world of
business,

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,450
fairly quickly,
people find themselves in a leadership

8
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,920
position in the sense that they're
responsible for a group or they're

9
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,950
responsible for a team.
And for,

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,970
for managing that team,
motivating at getting people to follow a

11
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:44,111
path to achieve some common objectives.
So there are techniques that you can

12
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:49,260
teach that help people to better
understand what's involved and,

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,670
and motivating teams and groups of
people.

14
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:54,140
And I think it's,
you know,

15
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,570
it's an ongoing process,
but there,

16
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,800
there are lots of people who believe
that leadership can be taught.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,360
Um,
and,

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,060
uh,
lots of corporations that take it very

19
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:07,610
seriously.
Corporations like General Electric,

20
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,110
which have,
you know,

21
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,950
made a reputation for,
for developing business leaders.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,153
Yeah.

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,020
Well,
I think,

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,650
uh,
how to function.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,860
Getting people to understand better,
how to function in teams,

26
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:25,820
how to work together.
Um,

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,400
how to set goals,
how to organize activities in ways that

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,450
lead you to achieve the common,
the common objectives of the team.
