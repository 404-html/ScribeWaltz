1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,443
Okay.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,040
It's usually Sam,
South African.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,750
I've retained the accent.
And I think that must have some sort of

4
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:16,870
deep psychological reason.
Um,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,270
and you know,
I think more and more for,

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,131
uh,
for people,

7
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,160
this is,
you know,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,130
the reality of,
of life in a,

9
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:27,190
in a globalized world,
it's less and less,

10
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm the exception.
And you know,

11
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,740
you could complain about it endlessly
and say you have no home.

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,980
And,
but it's also this incredible privilege

13
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:38,530
to move between countries.
And,

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,260
um,
so I try and remind myself of that

15
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:42,280
anytime,
you know,

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,580
I,
I'm about to fall into the trap of,

17
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:46,930
of self pity,
you know,

18
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,240
having family members.
My parents are now in Australia and my

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,640
sister's in London,
I'm in New York.

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,540
And it is a dilemma of,
you know,

21
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:58,541
how does a family ever then find its way
back to one another after so long living

22
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:02,380
apart.
But at the moment it's still feels more

23
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:03,214
like,
um,

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:03,760
good.
