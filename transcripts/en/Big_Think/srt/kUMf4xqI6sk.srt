1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,500
If you look at the products and services
that exist in this world,

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,560
sometimes it is truly staggering the
number of choices that people are given.

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,960
There is this feeling again amongst
people that I spoke to who,

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,700
who are known champions of simplicity,
that too much choice can actually

5
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,350
stifle,
uh,

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,330
uh,
customers enthusiasm or,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,260
or stall the,
the selling process because you're just

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,970
giving them too much to think about.
So I just do my own casual research and

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,680
I,
because I'm a techie kind of a guy,

10
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:41,690
I look at like,
uh,

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,910
Dell's website versus hps and then
apples and it's,

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,310
it is quite extraordinary.
If you look at at Dell's website there,

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,410
I might get these numbers slightly
wrong,

14
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:56,760
but I'm pretty sure I'm right.
26 distinct models of laptops.

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,310
This was as a couple of months ago when
I last look.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,720
Um,
uh,

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,630
HP has 41,
I believe it is an apple has three.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,650
And what's extraordinary is that if you
look at the PC category,

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,240
um,
you know,

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,180
share of market,
apple never gets bored and like 10%,

21
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,670
but because they do these fewer things
better,

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,220
um,
their share of the profit in the

23
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,130
category is actually more than hp and
Dell combined.

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,110
So that lack of choice isn't really
hurting apple at all.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,770
You might even say it's helping them.
You don't want to dumb things down and

26
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:37,080
you don't want to get people to feel
like they don't have enough choice,

27
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,820
but,
but you want to give them the right

28
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,690
choices as opposed to infinite choices.
You want to make it easier for them

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,770
simpler.
So I think apple has done a terrific job

30
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,540
of that.
And there are other companies in the

31
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,480
world that,
that treat their customers in that way

32
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,840
where it's actually a way of giving a
customer more respect,

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,660
um,
and demonstrating that you understand

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,810
what drives them because you're not
saying we don't know what you want.

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,010
So here's 40 things to choose from.
We're saying we get that you have this

36
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:08,250
particular need and this is a great
solution for you.

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,500
And that proves to customers that you
share their values.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,430
And when a person feels that a company
shares their values,

39
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,240
they tend to give them their business
and that makes them more loyal

40
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,400
customers.
There's a lot of,

41
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,670
um,
concern at there for apple these days

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,880
that maybe it's losing its sense of
simplicity.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,390
Steve jobs is gone and Tim Cook doesn't
share those same values,

44
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:37,360
whatever that product lines are getting
bigger and um,

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,160
it's less simple to choose what you're
looking for.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,990
Product naming could be an issue.
Now this is where I'm going to start

47
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,750
sounding if I haven't already like an
apple fanboy,

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,910
and I don't mean to cause I try to be
objective,

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,630
but I think a lot of it is the result of
apple just being the most overanalyzed

50
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,483
company on Earth.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,250
Because if you look at what they're
doing compared to what other companies

52
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:02,680
are doing,
it is vastly simpler.

53
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:06,340
I think what the real issue is is that,
uh,

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
audiences mature apple has tens of
millions more customers today than it

55
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,850
did when Steve Jobs was CEO.
And they're just,

56
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,610
there's a wide range of needs.
Um,

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,820
people say,
Steve would never do that when certain

58
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,770
things,
when in fact Steven did do that.

59
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,190
The ipod was,
this revolution changed the way we,

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,590
we listened to and discover music and it
was a super big hit.

61
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,670
And then a couple of years later,
therefore ipods and nobody had any

62
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,890
problem with that because that was steve
jobs doing it.

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,970
So now we had a tremendous hit,
have an iphone and now there are three

64
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,470
models of I funds,
you know,

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,130
they still got one more to go before
it's as bad as ipod was.

66
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,100
But the reason they had all those ipods
and the reason they have all these

67
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,550
iphones is because each one is for
distinctly different needs.

68
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,730
So to me,
that's not a sign of complexity.

69
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,340
That's just a company maturing,
having a larger audience and,

70
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,020
and,
and maturing a particular product line.

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,770
And the same is true of I ipads.
You've got the pro version for people

72
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,060
who need to create,
you know,

73
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,680
with the pencil.
Um,

74
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,670
and you've got more of a consumer level
IPAD.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So those things don't bother me at all.
Naming is a different issue because you

76
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:22,600
know,
you get like an iphone,

77
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,920
there's a success and a success plus and
an se that doesn't have a number on it.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,540
Uh,
what's going to happen when the seven

79
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,910
comes out?
Is it still an se or is it going to be a

80
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:34,270
seven s II and what does it have two
letters and the other ones have one

81
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:38,500
litter and that kind of a thing.
It does start feeling a little bit like,

82
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,770
um,
like many companies out there,

83
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,740
big companies,
a lot of numbers and letters and that

84
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,410
part does not make me happy as just as
a,

85
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,850
as an apple fan.

86
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,760
I think it must be a better way to do
that.

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,773
Uh,
you know,

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,320
could be just like an ipad or Imac and
not have any number attached to it and

89
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,600
just,
it has a year in parentheses when they,

90
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,420
when they speak about it or when you get
service or whatever.

91
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,420
Maybe you just have an iphone or an
iphone plus,

92
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,560
um,
that sounds similar to me,

93
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,000
but you know,
who am I?

94
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,030
There's all kinds of behind the scenes
reasons why things happen.

95
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,320
But I think,
again,

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,000
whether or not something is truly simple
almost doesn't matter.

97
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,170
It's the perception of simplicity.
And I think today the perception of

98
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:28,030
simplicity with apple is a bit more
challenged there.

99
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,120
Those product issues,
uh,

100
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,620
which may or may not be an issue
depending on your point of view.

101
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,400
But then there's something like apple
music that has been generally,

102
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,210
uh,
not well received when it comes to the

103
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,044
interface.

104
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,550
It's an,
it's confusing.

105
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,560
Um,
and you do have to wonder,

106
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,260
how did apple ever released that
product?

107
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,880
You know,
why didn't they look at that?

108
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:53,260
And they have their super high level of
their high standards when it comes to

109
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,770
simplicity,
who didn't raise their hand and say,

110
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,910
I don't get it.
Can you make that more clear?

111
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,300
So I don't know.
I don't know what the answer is there.

112
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,230
I just think it's,
um,

113
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,310
maybe some growing pains.
Maybe apple needs a,

114
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:11,390
a minister of simplicity to oversee it
all.

115
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:16,391
Who knows?
But I don't think that apple is losing

116
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,160
its love of simplicity.
If you listen to anything,

117
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,880
Tim Cook says anything.
Johnny Ive says they're not just saying

118
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,040
things to try to fool us.
That's what they talk about,

119
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,510
making products that people can love,
and you have to have a simple product

120
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,470
for someone to fall in love with it.
So there's no doubt in my mind they have

121
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,770
the values they need to execute on the
values,

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,500
but I think they'll,
again,

123
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,840
the fan boy speaks.
I think there'll be okay.
