1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,150
I try to think like a man.
Uh,

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,520
I think that's one of the things that
allowed me to,

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,500
to get as far as I did get in my
profession.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,530
But I never forgot that I was a woman.
So,

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,011
you know,
I would,

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:23,220
I would always ask a man like,
this is the disastrous situation we're

7
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:24,270
in.
I'm terrified.

8
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,160
Why aren't you scared?
And they would say,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,421
God,
yes,

10
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,590
we're scared,
but you know,

11
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:29,910
we're men,
we're not going to show it.

12
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,840
And I thought,
wow,

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,520
I can pretend that I'm not scared and,
and maybe if I act courageous,

14
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,090
eventually I will be courageous and
it'll be a self fulfilling prophecy.

15
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,560
And that's pretty much what happened.
You can learn some of the skills that

16
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:48,561
men have and be more like them in a good
way and without losing the things that

17
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:53,610
make you inherently a strong woman.
And then I think you've got the best of

18
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:57,240
both worlds.
I think that women are wired to be good

19
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,410
leaders.
We just,

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,330
we just don't use all of our skills and
we don't pick up the things that the men

21
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,450
are doing really well and learn.
Some of those skills from them.

22
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,080
When the women who do that are very
strong women?

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,810
Well,
I mean if you look at the way that a man

24
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:21,280
is a man does not know how to multitask
because he's not going to be giving

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,610
birth to triplets were multitasking
would really be important.

26
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:28,990
So he compartmentalizes,
his brain is filled with little drawers

27
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:31,630
and he puts everything in these little
drawers and he pulled out a drawer and

28
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:35,560
when it's time to deal with whatever the
content is and when he's finished it,

29
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,890
he puts the door back and he doesn't get
distracted and so he's focused.

30
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,600
A woman's brain is kind of like my chair
in my bedroom and I was going to

31
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:46,180
college.
All my clothes and possessions were

32
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,780
always heaped on this chair and that's
kind of how a woman's brain and she has

33
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:53,970
everything is all mixed in,
all mixed up and it's a whole like a

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,350
big,
big glob of thoughts.

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,540
And in work it's probably better to be
focused to get a job done and

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,500
concentrated enough to do a good job
with one task and then go on to the

37
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,990
other.
Because if you have 14 balls in the air

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,020
and you drop 12 of them,
you know they're not going to remember,

39
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,740
oh,
you kept two balls in the air,

40
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:17,140
they're going to go get dropped 12 balls
and they're broken.

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,730
We're a guy's only juggling one ball.
So he can keep that ball going forever

42
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:23,680
and you know,
pitch it,

43
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,890
get it in the right hands,
solve the problem,

44
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:29,860
and then get the next ball.
And we,

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,320
we can learn to do that.
It's hard.

46
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,360
It took me many,
many years to learn to do that,

47
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,470
but we can learn that.
