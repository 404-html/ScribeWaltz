1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,080
I think the Darra certainly tensions.
There are certainly some skepticisms.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,640
Um,
and I think,

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,560
you know,
there are some young people who wish the

4
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,600
old folks would stop talking about back
in the day.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,910
Uh,
but that's true of all young people when

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,460
they talked to old people,
right?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,980
It's not just a,
a true of our community,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,890
it's true of all communities.
But one thing that I think is important

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,000
understanding is that there have been a,
there are generations in our community,

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,890
right?
And thank God for that.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,940
Right?
Uh,

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,180
one of the things that's so tragic about
the lgbt community is that we have a

13
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:41,640
generation,
many of whom were lost to the AIDS

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,610
crisis.
And so unlike a lot of communities,

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,620
I think something that's very specific
to our community,

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,820
uh,
is that,

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,890
you know,
we have the stonewall generation that

18
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,630
was there,
the participate in the protests that

19
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,260
were part of that early,
uh,

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,320
uprising of gay liberation,
uh,

21
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,050
that are really feeling of,
of liberation that came out of that

22
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:58,630
movement.

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,300
Uh,
and then there was a period of time

24
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,610
where we lost a lot of our brothers and
sisters,

25
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,230
especially our brothers,
uh,

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,120
to the aids to aids.
And there is a pain there and there are

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,530
scars there that are,
that will never go away,

28
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,950
nor should they.
So this idea that we're all kind of free

29
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:18,360
and all this progress has been made and
that the young people in this generation

30
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:21,240
that are coming up now have no worries,
right?

31
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,380
The fact of matter is there are actually
rising std rates and rising HIV

32
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:28,470
infection rates in certain segments of
this generation.

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,660
A part,
certainly my young men of color,

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,100
young men in the African American and
Latino communities there arising HIV

35
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:37,680
rates among this members of this
generation.

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,380
Uh,
there are all sorts of considerations

37
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:42,540
that,
and struggles that this generation has

38
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,920
to,
has to work with.

39
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,561
And so,
and,

40
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,890
and,
and the progress that's been made will,

41
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,050
will yield its own struggles,
right?

42
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,980
I mean,
you know,

43
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,100
it's one thing,
the struggle to earn the right to marry.

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,010
It's another thing to struggle to make
your marriage work.

45
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,190
Right?
Then once we have the right to marry,

46
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,190
then we're going to actually marry each
other and make it work.

47
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,620
And that's not easy,
right?

48
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,610
Nobody's ever been married,
will ever tell you that.

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,860
I mean,
what's the biggest crisis of the,

50
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,430
uh,
the,

51
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,770
the,
the worst thing that's happened as a

52
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:13,950
result of the goodrich decision in
Massachusetts is that the good rich has

53
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:15,480
got divorced,
right?

54
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:15,991
You know,
and,

55
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,630
and you know,
and I,

56
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,870
I feel badly for them,
but the end of the day,

57
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:23,871
like that court ruling was named after a
lesbian couple that were heralded as

58
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,280
heroines of our movement.
And they should have been,

59
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,720
they were very,
very important,

60
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,790
but they're now divorced,
right?

61
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,790
So that's its own struggle is to figure
out how to make families,

62
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,730
how to make our families work,
how to marry each other and love each

63
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,870
other and stay true to each other.

64
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,790
And that's,
that's a human struggle,

65
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,100
right?
That's a human struggle that transcends

66
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,100
all histories in all communities.
Uh,

67
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,170
and it's one that this generation is
going to have to struggle with in a way

68
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,350
that other generations have never had to
because they didn't have the right to.

69
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,640
But these reits also will,
we'll bring out their own struggles.

70
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,500
And I mean,
I see this all the time.

71
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,701
Uh,
and,

72
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,271
and,
you know,

73
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:01,900
so I think we all need to be more alert
to the differences that we,

74
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,510
uh,
experience and,

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,311
and,
and,

76
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,730
and,
and give witness to based on where we

77
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,860
are in history.
But I think we also have to understand

78
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:09,290
that,
you know,

79
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,790
we all have struggles and as a result,
we are all struggling people.

80
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,490
And that,
that should be able to elicit a certain

81
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:19,330
kind of empathy that can sustain us,
I think,

82
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,570
more strongly and more deeply than it
than it currently does.
