1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,890
You know,
his epitaph may very well be.

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,220
He went for it.
I mean,

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,001
you know,
I mean,

4
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,220
mind you,
he went for something completely

5
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:19,980
different than he said he was going to
go for.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,660
I mean remember,
everyone seems to have forgotten that

7
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:25,450
the,
the whole decrying of nation building.

8
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:29,260
It's a weird that everyone just sort of
forgot that that nine slash 11,

9
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,990
as terrible as it was,
would completely switch around your

10
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,060
philosophical underpinnings.
I mean,

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,400
that's like,
it doesn't really make sense to me,

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,960
you know,
so,

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,210
so I wouldn't go so far as to say that
George Bush definitely has a core and

14
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,370
knows who he is.
I don't know about that.
