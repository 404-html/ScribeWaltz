1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,243
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,920
part of it is blind luck taught us.
Everything is blind luck,

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,400
you know,
really just rewind everything we've said

4
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,810
this interview and you can add blind
luck.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,620
Certainly in my career I've been
incredibly lucky that we say I was,

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,160
I wasn't as good as spin made me look.
It wasn't as bad as gear made me look

7
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:27,750
when it failed.
Uh,

8
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:32,070
I had a lot of great luck would spin as
well as some good hard work and some

9
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,960
good instincts.
So,

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,460
um,
you know,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,350
I think luck is important even in
creativity because people walk in the

12
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:43,800
door and if they like it,
they call their friends and they walk in

13
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,634
the door,
you know,

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,160
sometimes you meet somebody randomly and
you say,

15
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:50,700
why don't you try writing for me?
Or how would you like to be a

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,850
photographer for me?
You know?

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,370
And it happens.
The environment though to sustain the,

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,520
the atmosphere of creativity is you have
to have the balls to risk doing

19
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,300
something edgy and having it failed.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,350
I used to say,
oh,

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,690
my photographers who came to work for
me,

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,613
you know,
I said,

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,620
I love your portfolio.
Take pictures that you would put in your

24
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,350
portfolio.
Do not give me middle of the road

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,800
average photography that you think is
safe,

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,850
so I'll hire you.
Again.

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,530
I'm telling you,
you got three assignments.

28
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,320
I don't care if the first two are crap.
You still get a third.

29
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,260
So in that confidence,
come out and take your pictures because

30
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,640
that's the voice I want in the magazine.
I say to my right,

31
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,030
it's the same thing.
Don't get me a safe middle of the road

32
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,040
piece.
Give me an edge.

33
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,390
Eps.
Find the truth.

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,550
The truth may not be pleasant.
We'll publish it either way,

35
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,880
if it's true,
but go out there in the conference.

36
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,670
I'm still going to hire you unless you
steal from us,

37
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,950
then I'm not going to argue and that
happened.

38
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,680
But you know,
basically one has to foster confidence

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
amongst one's creative people.
There's nobody less creative,

40
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,100
less confident in the creative field.
And I say that myself is when I'm

41
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,140
writing,
let's conference anybody on the planet,

42
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm sure.
Um,

43
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,090
but you must foster confidence.
People must feel they can actually go

44
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,950
and be artists for you.
Now,

45
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:10,890
a lot of editors and publishers don't
want artistry.

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,550
They want straightforward industrial
produce a product as to fill the space.

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,450
Don't upset your advertise.
A complaint I have about Conde Nast is

48
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,180
that they are more concerned about not
upsetting their advertisers than they

49
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,160
are about delivering a gps.
Yeah.

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,060
Then we fear will deliver great pieces
and so when New York had those two

51
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,910
exceptions,
but you have to foster confidence that

52
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:37,911
people can go out and actually reached
the brass ring in each assignment and

53
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,980
then you get critical and that begets
other creators.
