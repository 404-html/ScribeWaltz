1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,270
I think I could speak for all the World
Bank employees.

2
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:15,230
It's a,
it's a job that is a very,

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,450
it gets,
it grabs you really strongly and you,

4
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:23,720
you do get up early in the morning and
you look forward to the day are very

5
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:27,650
interesting work because what could be
more interesting than to work on some

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,000
hundred and 50 countries on the boat,
a hundred sectors,

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,980
uh,
and on global issues,

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,220
uh,
from such an outpost as the World Bank,

9
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:42,221
which is owned by 195 countries of the
world and from which you do look at the

10
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:45,760
world as if it was a whole planet.
Uh,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,840
not from the country point of view but
from a sort of overall global point of

12
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:54,530
view.
So it's a very interesting job to be in

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,440
and you get to learn a lot of things
about a lot of countries and a lot of

14
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:03,860
people and the culture of the
institutions is interesting.

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,860
It's one where there are 150 or 60
nationalities in the house and you never

16
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,320
think about the nationality of your
colleagues.

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,490
You forget about it.
Everyone has the same jargon.

18
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:21,491
And codewords and you forget that
someone is Italian or Bangladeshi or

19
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,590
Tanzania.
And so it is a little bit,

20
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:27,860
it has the culture of the world as I
would wish it to have.

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,680
I would wish to world had that sort of
culture one day.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,730
Uh,
it's beyond the Knight Nation State and

23
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:37,400
the nationality culture.
It's sort of one level above.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,230
And that also makes it very fascinating.
And the third thing that,

25
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,420
uh,
had me taking at the World Bank,

26
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:49,421
it's very libertarian institution.
There was a lot of room for debates on

27
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,510
what worked and what didn't work.
They were a lot of arguments,

28
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,230
academic arguments or even practical
arguments one way or the other.

29
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,920
And you could do many things.
And I did in my time,

30
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,830
uh,
I pioneered many new things and I was

31
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:08,480
never whistled back in that way.
That was part of the reasons why I saw

32
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:09,530
like the institution

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,710
[inaudible].
