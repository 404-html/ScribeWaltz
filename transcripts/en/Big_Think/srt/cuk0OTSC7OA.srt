00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,450
The measure of a good life is really to
be contented with yourself,

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,730
uh,
to,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,560
to,
to be happy in what you are doing,

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,070
uh,
to be happily in the relationships that

5
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,430
you're in.
And,

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,270
and Ah,
darn it,

7
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:32,500
if you are not,
then have the energy,

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,860
the decision to change and make it
happen.
