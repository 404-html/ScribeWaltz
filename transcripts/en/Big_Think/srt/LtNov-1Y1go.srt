1
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,210
When I was at Harvard Business School
back in 1990,

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,350
there were probably eight people in the
nonprofit club.

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,600
Um,
and I think we looked at slightly

4
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,600
askance by the folks because it wasn't
the venture capital club with the

5
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:25,420
finance club.
Now today on campus,

6
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:29,380
the largest single club at Harvard
Business School is the social enterprise

7
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,980
club.
So in 20 years or less than that,

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,200
you have had a shift in something pretty
fundamental in this country around I

9
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:42,760
think young people wanting to take more
responsibility for those around them,

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,290
seeing their responsibility slightly
more broadly defined than just motivated

11
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:52,291
self interest in getting involved.
So we have so many more young folks in

12
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:56,770
our colleges and our Grad schools today
mentoring our students,

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,130
volunteering,
getting involved in service movements

14
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,630
like Americorps and Vista.
So I,

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,330
I think the pendulum is certainly
swinging to a direction where many young

16
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:12,331
people are taking more responsibility
for those around them and realizing

17
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,130
that's not at odds with,
you know,

18
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,310
good old motivated self interest in free
market capitalism.

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,600
And in fact,
you know,

20
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:23,620
we all remember that and Smith wrote a
book called the wealth of nations.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,400
And talked about free markets and
capitalism,

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,890
why they were good ultimately for our
society.

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,310
He also wrote another book.
It was talking about the theory of moral

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,360
essentials in what he said is you can
have a free market in,

25
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:40,120
it's going to work best,
but at the same time,

26
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:45,121
at some point you have to realize that
just getting more and more and more is

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,460
actually not in society's best interest.
So even Adam Smith as our free market

28
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,290
economy,
free market economies would say there's

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,380
a concept of being responsible for
others in wrote a book about that.

30
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:00,610
Equally,
I think we are.

31
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,200
Don't remember he actually wrote a few
books.

32
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:07,201
One of them talked about moral
essentials in the danger of just seeing

33
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:12,421
in a creative process without any sense
of what's enough or any sense of

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,540
distribution that I have the opportunity
now to help others.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,890
Uh,
you know,

36
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:20,470
that's equally part of keeping a very
strong,

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,441
uh,
in,

38
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,800
in well functioning capitalist society
in check.

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,900
Certainly many,
many more Grad schools are offering loan

40
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:31,930
forgiveness or loan reduction for those
going into the nonprofit sector.

41
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,200
Um,
and I do think with the rise of social

42
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:39,460
entrepreneurship,
the rise of nonprofits hiring better and

43
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:44,020
better people growing more quickly,
that we're attracting incredible talent

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,080
into the sector.
And the reality is is people are getting

45
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,420
paid more and more.
So the gap between the nonprofit and

46
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:53,400
private sector is shrinking.
And certainly the last 10 years it's

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,470
shrinking from when I started back in
2000.

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,210
Um,
the other way I think about the is I'm

49
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:03,370
not a huge proponent of,
of handouts,

50
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,780
so I have not seen with people who are
able bodied enable minded,

51
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,910
they were handouts are producing good
outcomes in a sense of entitlement is a

52
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:17,290
very destructive sentiment.
And if you ever want to play the victim,

53
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,760
you're not going to get a hit.

54
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,180
So when I think about that pendulum,
it's,

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,300
there's a lot of personal accountability
that has to be invested in any nonprofit

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,550
organization.
I think that is serving someone who is

57
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,110
able bodied enabled minded.
I mean,

58
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,000
there,
there are needs for charitable acts or

59
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,180
needs for handouts for someone who
really cannot provide for themselves or

60
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,810
we slipped to a place where they
literally cannot take care of

61
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:43,870
themselves,
but that's not a majority.

62
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,130
I think,
of what we're trying to do here,

63
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,880
especially at Europe.
We believe you've got to combine deep

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,240
personal accountability,
taking charge of yourself.

65
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,980
Not saying woe is me,
but saying I want a chance.

66
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,420
I want an opportunity.
I mean,

67
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,880
America needs to be an opportunity
society.

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,000
And so the young adults we serve want an
opportunity.

69
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,610
They do not want a handout.
They want a hand up.

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,830
And so my belief is that pendulum in
terms of maybe reaching out and

71
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:16,570
supporting others also has to be
balanced by a healthy dose of personal

72
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,570
accountability for those being helped in
without.

73
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,290
Which I think,
uh,

74
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,380
I don't think the system will ever work
well.
