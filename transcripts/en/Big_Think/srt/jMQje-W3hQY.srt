1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,630
It's a loaded question with me actually
because,

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,860
um,
I'm,

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,220
I'm from Iran.
Originally.

4
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:21,260
I was born there,
um,

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,100
and the first several years of my life
we lived there and the plan was to stay

6
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:25,940
there.
Of course,

7
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,560
this omic revolution,
uh,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,540
last up.
And so,

9
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,700
uh,
we moved to Los Angeles.

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:35,030
I was raised in Los Angeles,
but my formative years were actually

11
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:40,031
spent in New York from 18 onwards.
So I have a sort of ultra hyphenated

12
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:46,190
identity,
I guess is Iranian American and um,

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,960
Los Angeleno and New Yorker by coastal,
by cultural,

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,820
well,
at the time of the hostage crisis,

15
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,690
they were still in Iran.
Um,

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,760
and they,
because my,

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,580
my mother and my father were both
educated,

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,800
um,
abroad to a degree.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,090
They,
you know,

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,980
when they got to the u s they spoke
English,

21
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,620
they were able to,
um,

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,020
work here.
Um,

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,180
it wasn't horrible.
Um,

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,050
but for them,
a lot of the fear came in just getting

25
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:22,860
out of Iran.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,360
You know,
the airports were shut down when they

27
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:26,670
tried to,
to get out because of the Iran,

28
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,350
Iraq war.
And,

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,310
um,
you know,

30
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,970
they were basically sort of Gypsies
through much of Europe.

31
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,160
You know,
they were in Turkey than they were.

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,430
That's from there.
They went to France to Germany,

33
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,070
you know,
and then they've just finally went to

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,460
Los Angeles by default because that's
what all the Iranians were doing.

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,720
Um,
but it wasn't so bad for them.

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,560
And I imagine it wasn't so bad for a lot
of Iranians because they all thoughts

37
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,270
was temporary.
You know,

38
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,030
they didn't even,
they only had two suitcases with them.

39
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,040
Um,
so,

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,740
and,
and all their stuff is still and in

41
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:06,420
house they own any Iran to this day
that's left pretty much untouched.

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,620
Everything as it was when they fled.
Because when,

43
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,720
when they talk,
people talk about Iranians flaying maybe

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,790
they really did flee.
Um,

45
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,790
some of them made the decision quite
rapidly for some of,

46
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,900
for some people like my family,
it was an almost overnight a decision

47
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,720
because it really never seemed like it
would be permanent.

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,460
Um,
that's a very tricky question as well.

49
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,960
Um,
I,

50
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,010
as I get older,
I tend to become more Iranian.

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,410
Um,
but

52
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,370
I guess I've,
I've now,

53
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,310
since the novel came out,
been forced to consider myself as an

54
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:50,311
Iranian American more and more so my
family is fairly traditional Iranian

55
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,910
family.
Um,

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,180
but the novel really split me into,
um,

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,530
made me sort of consider being a
California and,

58
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:03,190
and a New Yorker.
So in some ways I emerged more confused.
