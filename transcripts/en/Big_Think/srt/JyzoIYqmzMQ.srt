1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,820
When do you start talking about hope?
Some people think it's immediately a

2
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:07,560
kind of Pollyanna ish thing,
like,

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,760
oh,
it should be hopeful,

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,500
or it's kind of a greeting card.
Um,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,730
sentiment.
You go kind of doe wide and start

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:19,170
thinking soft thoughts about how we
should all be hopeful in one another.

7
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,870
And of course there are some important
things to be said in favor of those

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,210
kinds of things,
but we think of hope as also an

9
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:29,211
extremely difficult and important and
foundational sort of state that can be

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,210
discussed in ways that aren't.
So saccharin.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,450
One of the interesting things that
philosophers talk about with respect to

12
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:44,451
hope is of course it's rationality.
So there's a sense in which you can't

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,780
hope for everything you can wish for.
Lots of things for which you can't hope.

14
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,781
I can wish that the bears won the
superbowl last year.

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,880
Uh,
but I can't hope that they won the

16
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,220
superbowl last year because we know that
they didn't.

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,550
And so it seems almost like you're
misusing the word to say,

18
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:06,480
I hope that they won last year,
or I hope that the weather was different

19
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,990
yesterday than it was.
So there's a kind of semantic content

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,740
that suggests that there are rationality
constraints on hope,

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,950
which philosophers tried to look at an
analyze.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,060
There's a kind of orthodox account.
People call it the Orthodox account

23
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,880
because most people share it,
uh,

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,710
that says that hope involves at least
desiring something and believing that

25
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,330
it's possible.
So in this case,

26
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,000
you wouldn't believe that the weather
yesterday could be different than it

27
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,850
was,
and so you wouldn't believe that's

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,230
possible.
And so you can't really hope for it.

29
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,290
So that's that condition that's
constraining the rationality of hope.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,460
And then there's this kind of debate
about what further conditions might be

31
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:45,294
required.

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,750
One thought experiment that people have
discussed frequently is that of the

33
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,210
Shawshank redemption.
So this is a Stephen King short story

34
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:57,720
that was turned into a film.
You have two characters and,

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,800
and read both of them really desire
something to get out of prison.

36
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,880
Both of them regarded as possible.
It's explicit in the story and in the

37
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:09,030
film,
but somehow one character,

38
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:14,031
andy is hopeful and says he's hopeful
and that he's acting in such a way as to

39
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,310
make it come about.
Even if he thinks it's extremely

40
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,700
unlikely.
And the other character red says he

41
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:25,050
can't allow himself to hope.
The fear of disappointment is too great

42
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,020
and will crush him.
So they both meet those conditions.

43
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,710
It's something they really desire and
it's something they believe to be

44
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,750
possible.
And yet one hopes and the other

45
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:37,200
despairs.
So cases like this make people think,

46
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,270
oh,
we need some other kind of condition to

47
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,940
really explain the difference between
hope and despair.

48
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,210
And that's where some of the debate is
at the moment,

49
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,120
trying to find this elusive third
conditions.

50
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,030
And different people have different
things they want to add to the Orthodox

51
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:54,480
conception.
My own favored approach,

52
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:59,481
which I'm in the middle of writing up a
is what I call the focus or attention

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,630
account of hope.
Uh,

54
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,620
so it basically says something like the
difference between hope and despair is

55
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:10,621
the extent to which you're focusing on
the very slim odds of the thing coming

56
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,520
about or whether you're focusing on the
fact that it's possible or that you take

57
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,730
it to be possible.
So if you're focused on the thing as a

58
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,430
possibility under the aspect of its
possibility,

59
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,710
if you want,
then you're hoping for it.

60
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,120
If you're focusing on the fact that it's
incredibly unlikely and the odds are so

61
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,870
such long shot odds,
then you're despairing of it.

62
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,230
So you can desire it in the same way you
can believe that it's possible in the

63
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,050
same way.
And it's this focus that really makes

64
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,290
the difference between hope and despair.
It might even be a kind of spectrum

65
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,520
thing where you can move back and forth.
The focus might be under your control

66
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:50,020
sometimes other times given the
circumstances or the the strength of the

67
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,840
desire that might not always be under
your control.

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,470
So I also kind of talk a little bit
about the way a certain kind of,

69
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,190
if you want,
mindfulness training can lead us to be

70
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:05,191
more hopeful people cultivating the
virtue of hope by learning how to focus

71
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:09,760
on something under the aspect of its
possibility rather than allowing our

72
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:13,600
focus or attention to always drift
towards the fact that it's so unlikely.

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,480
Um,
you can even hear this in the way that

74
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,710
someone might say something about what
they hope for or despair of.

75
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,160
So in the Andy and red case,
Andy might say,

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,240
I know that it's really unlikely,
but at least it's possible and sort of

77
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,540
focus on the possibility.
That's the hopeful sort of approach.

78
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,290
And Red might say,
I know that it's possible,

79
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,650
but it's really unlikely.
Same desire,

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,160
same estimation of the probabilities,
but you can even hear in the way it's

81
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,180
stated,
I kind of difference in attitude that I

82
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,970
take to be the essential difference
between hope and despair.

83
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,770
So one more locus of discussion is the
relationship between hope,

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,020
optimism and action.
I think a lot of people regard hope in a

85
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:06,550
way as unserious because it gets
detached from action in a certain way.

86
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,300
So hope is something that you do when
you can't do anything else.

87
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,130
It's the kind of curse that is left in
Pandora's box because you still have it,

88
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,880
even though there's nothing else you can
do with respect to achieving the goal

89
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,510
and question.

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm just hoping for it.
It seems possible,

91
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:25,270
but there's not much I can do.
I'm just sort of passively hoping.

92
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,030
Um,
that obviously seems like a bit of a

93
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,090
character of the way in which hope might
actually work.

94
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,420
And so we're curious,
and people in both psychology,

95
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,880
sociology,
or other social sciences as well as

96
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:40,900
philosophers and religious studies
people in our project think about the

97
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:45,901
way in which hope underwrites action,
hope manifested itself in action.

98
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,500
Hope is the result of actions.
So agency and hope is a really

99
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:54,970
interesting set of issues that we think
is underdeveloped.
