00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,350
Aiden's
in California,

2
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:10,190
I'm a musician and a songwriter and I
really would like to know what makes

3
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:13,220
music so human and powerful in its
nature.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,320
Thank you.
Well,

5
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:16,420
I didn't,
as you know,

6
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:20,320
I know everything.
I don't know why,

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,260
but it sure is deep within us.
Now.

8
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:28,261
I remember when I was in school,
people in psychology class talked about

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,660
dogs responding to octaves.
That is the doubling of the frequency.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,650
And so there may be something to that
that,

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,330
uh,
there are natural residences that appeal

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,120
to us that as something to do with our
voices.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,250
But I have also,
I mean,

14
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:49,750
I'm not an expert in this,
but I've been to China and people will

15
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:54,751
listen to sort of western disco music,
but other music like swing music,

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,570
um,
that,

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,940
that doesn't appeal to them if they
don't like it.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,540
There's something about the traditions
that with tonal language speakers versus

19
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:11,110
us that uh,
doesn't Jive,

20
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:14,290
doesn't fit in.
But then in Japan it's not a tonal

21
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,150
language,
but they also got something that sounds

22
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,260
more like Chinese to me.

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,190
I don't know.
It is deep within us and I will say,

24
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,690
uh,
if you want to get to Carnegie Hall,

25
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:23,710
practice,
practice,

26
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:27,370
practice,
I will say scales are very important.

27
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:29,500
Do Scales.
That's what it's all based on.

28
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,380
Somewhere down there.
And uh,

29
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,020
if you're going to play the blues,
I'm looking at you with your guitar.

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,130
If you're going to play the blues,
you got to get a couple of minor chords

31
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:40,660
in there.
You got to have a major third and

32
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,410
seventh or something like that.
But I'm not sure why,

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,120
but it's got to be just ultimately based
on trying to attract a mate that's got

34
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:53,260
to be what's down in their
carry on it.
