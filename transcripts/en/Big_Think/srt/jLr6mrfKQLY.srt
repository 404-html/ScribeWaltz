1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,280
There is a shortage of people who have a
technology background and it's really

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:06,890
becoming a business problem.
And it's one of the number of things.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,770
Number one,
things that ceos complain about,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,700
two members of Congress when I see them,
is that it's difficult to get visas.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,150
So you might have someone from Pakistan
who has a master's in computer science,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,010
uh,
wants to come to United States and get a

7
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:21,560
job.
I would argue that that's credibly

8
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:25,970
beneficial for our economy.
And if he doesn't come here and millions

9
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:28,520
like that,
then what companies will do is end up

10
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:33,521
employing people in other countries,
which is okay from my selfish interest,

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,590
but not as good for the country overall.
And so the,

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,830
as you know,
there's an enormous outsource community

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,380
in India with hundreds of thousands of
people,

14
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:44,660
which is fantastic for India.
And I'm supportive of that.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,200
But putting on my us hat,
I'd love to have many of those people in

16
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:49,500
the United States,
uh,

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,250
working for companies,
creating jobs and then at some point

18
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:56,030
spinning off and starting new companies.
So anything we can do that it is more

19
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:57,770
training and,
uh,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,370
and more visas for qualified people,
I think is great for this country.
