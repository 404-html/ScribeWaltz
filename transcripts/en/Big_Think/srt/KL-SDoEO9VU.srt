1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,930
Have a very optimistic view of,
of market work,

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:08,931
which sometime is associated to,
to Adam Smith is the view that you have

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,650
self regulation of the market and the
natural forces,

4
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:18,651
natural market forces can take care of
everything and in particular can ensure

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,080
that inequality will never increase to
such an extent that it becomes socially

6
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:30,621
and economically and politically useless
or even dangerous for that matter.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,930
Now I think in fact,
if you,

8
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:38,931
if you reread the Adam's meets or if you
try to look at the economic developments

9
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,550
route eastery you see that,
you know,

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,940
you cannot expect everything from the
market.

11
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:49,110
You cannot just rely on natural forces
to solve all problems.

12
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:54,111
And I think one of the conclusion from
the history of political economy and the

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,930
history of economic growth and
inequality is that,

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,040
uh,
you need a strong public institutions in

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,130
order to put these poor,
full market forces,

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,081
uh,
in,

17
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:08,400
in the,
in the right direction where market

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:13,401
forces can produce a lot of innovation,
a lot of incentives for [inaudible]

19
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,140
entrepreneurship.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,520
And this is very positive,
but it would be a mistake to,

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,320
to,
to rely on and count on these natural

22
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:25,790
forces to sort of self regulate a
themself.

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,600
And,
and if you look,

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,140
uh,
in in particular the period going to the

25
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,830
financial crises of 2007,
2008,

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,260
you have a very large concentration of
economic gains in poor,

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,360
relatively small group of the
population.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,660
And I think everybody agrees today's as
this has contributed not only to the

29
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:54,141
stagnation of median household income,
but also to the rise of ouch all debt,

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,120
which in turn put pressure on the
financial system and probably did

31
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:05,121
contribute to fragilize the financial
system with consequences that we know in

32
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:09,960
terms of financial crises,
recession and unemployment,

33
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:13,110
which we are now starting to get out of
this.

34
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:17,820
But there has been many years of lost
growth and the lost a lot of,

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,830
uh,
social suffering because of this.

36
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,780
So we need a strong public institutions
in order to regulate this,

37
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:28,310
uh,
this market forces and the sometime,

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,990
uh,
there's really accessive face in these

39
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:34,070
forces.
There are cycles over history.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,750
You know,
probably after the Great Depression

41
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:41,490
after World War Two,
people realize that market forces need

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,520
to be a strongly regulated and then
starting in the 70s and the 80s with the

43
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,960
radio and,
and touch our revolution.

44
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,290
And even more so after the fall of the
Soviet Union,

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,680
we entered in the 1990s and 2000 in a
new cycle of sometime unlimited face

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,230
into self regulation of markets.
And to a large extent we are still in

47
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,850
this phase and a,
and I sing the reaction to policy

48
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,851
reaction to the financial crisis of 2007
2008 has been too limited so far.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,490
And this could happen again.
You know,

50
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,260
we've asked a lot to our central banks
in the US,

51
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,270
in Europe and of course it's easy to
print a billions of dollars or billions

52
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:31,930
of euros to avoid complete bankruptcy of
the financial system,

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,010
which is what happened in the 1930s and
which and dinner peanut complete

54
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,000
catastrophe.
So it's,

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,770
you know,
it's better to avoid that.

56
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,940
But at the same time,
printing money is not enough to solve

57
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:46,370
the structural problem that we need to
sell.

58
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,201
So,
you know,

59
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,960
the good news is that we avoided the
complete bankruptcy and complete

60
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,880
depression.
But the bad news is that we did not

61
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,850
really serve the structural problems,
which might in the future create a new

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,833
new crisis.

63
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,550
Okay.
