1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,650
Hi Bill,
my name is Sam.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,430
My question for you is why are we trying
to live on Mars and recreate earth there

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,840
by making it an atmosphere and soil and
water we can drink and such.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,520
Why can't we take those ideas and
motivation and directed at our own

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,970
planet that we clearly need the help
with?

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,110
Why?
Why is it easier to start fresh on

7
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,830
another planet that get people talking
about our own?

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,510
Sam.
Sam,

9
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:35,630
you are my man.
Sam,

10
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,760
you're thinking as I do.
Okay.

11
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,110
I meet a lot of people.
You know,

12
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:42,860
I'm the CEO of the Planetary Society.
We advanced based science and

13
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:46,910
exploration.
I encourage you to join and as I say

14
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:51,320
about the planetary society,
we are not crazy.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,610
You meet a lot of people.
I meet a lot of people who want to go to

16
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:59,840
Mars and make it like earth.
Just as you're the very idea that you're

17
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,840
questioning and I think people don't,
first of all,

18
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:06,050
just don't grasp the scale of it.
It's a planet.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,570
It's a whole planet.
It's not

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,300
a,
it's not a wetland that you can reclaim

21
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,700
and build a parking garage on top of.
It's.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,010
It's a whole planet.
Furthermore,

23
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:24,011
this planet where you and I are from is
perfectly suited to us.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,410
We our ancestors and their ancestors and
so on,

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,360
grew up here,
tuned to these environments,

26
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:37,361
to these climates that we have here on
earth and so people want to go to Mars

27
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,630
and the spirit of adventure.

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,060
Now,
as you may infer from my accent,

29
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:46,061
I'm from the United States and my a lot
of my ancestors came here from Denmark

30
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,750
and Europe and they set up shop and what
the colony of Massachusetts and then

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:59,381
they went all the way across North
America to a through Wyoming,

32
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:03,800
the state of Wyoming and now to the west
coast to to Washington state and

33
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,750
California,
and they did that in this great

34
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,140
tradition of pioneering spirit.
Just keep going,

35
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,730
keep expanding,
keep spreading out,

36
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,170
and human kind has done that.
You know,

37
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:16,940
everybody's from Africa or ancestors are
all from the continent of Africa and we

38
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:21,290
spread all over the world,
spread to Australia across open ocean.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,910
The polynesians in canoes.
Oh right,

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,920
we're spreading now,
man.

41
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,480
We're going okay,
and so people think,

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,030
oh,
let's spread out and go to Mars.

43
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,390
It's a whole nother thing to go to Mars.

44
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,750
I tell people this all the time.
There is nothing.

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,240
There's hardly any water.
There's a little bit.

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,550
There is nothing to eat.
There is no air,

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,440
there's no air.
What?

48
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,310
We can build a bubble and you were
moving into cook the Martian rocks and

49
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:51,140
get the oxygen out of it.
Okay?

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,260
It's just not so easy.
Just as you asked them,

51
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,230
why don't we do that here on earth or do
use that same technology here on earth

52
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,120
and this is part my little mission as a
human.

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,370
No,
not CEO of the planetary society is

54
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,060
reminding everybody that we've got to
take care of the earth in order for us

55
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,090
all to live here.
There are seven point 3 billion people

56
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,790
as we're recording right now.
By 2050,

57
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,970
there will be nine and maybe even 10
billion people by the middle of the

58
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:19,750
century and they're all gonna.
Want to eat something and drink

59
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,190
something and water and wash and carry
on,

60
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,810
and that's going to take us taking.

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,710
It's going to require us to take much
better care of our own planet.

62
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,000
Now,
with that said,

63
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,210
I like to remind everybody also,
although you don't want to go to Mars

64
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,140
and have a permanent settlement,
there are colony.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,680
You do want to have a base there just as
humankind has a base in the Antarctic

66
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,750
where scientists go and study the
Antarctic,

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,450
learn about the environment,
learn about our planet,

68
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:57,010
learn about ice,
and the are the earth's history and the

69
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:00,150
climate today,
and the greenhouse gases and the

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,120
effective industrial emissions and so
on.

71
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,960
All of these discoveries are made in
Antarctica.

72
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,270
If we were to discover evidence of life
on Mars,

73
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:14,890
something that was once alive,
they're the equivalent of a what a

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,850
geologist called stromatolites
fossilized bacteria that have turned to

75
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,850
stone.
It would be astounding if we found

76
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:26,851
something still alive there.
There are these recurring slope linear,

77
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,820
which is geology expression.

78
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,360
For what look like rivulets look like
little rivers.

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,350
They may be just rockfalls turned over
gravel.

80
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,650
That as a slightly different color than
the surrounding rock,

81
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,710
but everybody thinks right now that it's
water.

82
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:49,711
Everybody's pretty sure by everybody
talking about people at the National

83
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,280
Aeronautics and Space Administration,
NASA and European Space Agency,

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,070
Isa Jackson,
Japanese aerospace,

85
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,270
exploration,
Roscosmos.

86
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,780
Everybody believes that there's
recurring flows of water every Martian

87
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,870
summer when what must be some
subterranean,

88
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,871
some under sand ice melts and if we.
If you have liquid water anywhere on

89
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,780
earth,
there's something alive everywhere.

90
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,340
There's liquid water.
There's something alive.

91
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,000
If there's something alive on Mars and
we could prove it,

92
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,590
show it to ourselves with our spacecraft
or with human explorers walking around,

93
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,240
I would change the world.
It would be equivalent to the see the

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,690
discoveries that copernicus made,
that the earth goes around the so all

95
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,880
the planets go around the sun,
not the other way around,

96
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,410
or Galileo.

97
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,890
We're not the only a body out in the
cosmos.

98
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:40,450
We got the moon.
We in fact,

99
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:44,440
Jupiter has its own moons and these
other discoveries that were so profound

100
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,140
a,
if we were to find life on another

101
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,950
world,
it would.

102
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,710
It would change this one and there's one
more element that we at the of this that

103
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,830
we at the planetary society celebrate
these discoveries.

104
00:05:56,831 --> 00:06:01,800
There's of life on Mars or on the moon
of Jupiter that is twice as much sea

105
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,290
waters,
the earth's called Europa.

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,510
You can see it with binoculars,
uh,

107
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,730
at night.
If we make this discovery of life,

108
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,370
it will not have been done by an
individual,

109
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,030
by Galileo or copernicus or Irene Curie.
It would be done by a society who

110
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:24,410
invested it's intellect and treasure in
this quest.

111
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,460
Let's go see what's out there.
Let's learn more about ourselves,

112
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,730
our past and,
and we all want to know whether or not

113
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:35,900
we're alone in the universe.
So if we look on these two worlds,

114
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:40,850
the earth and Mars and find life on both
of them that would suggest that life is

115
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:44,210
very common in the cosmos and this
would,

116
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,500
this would affect the way each and every
one of us feels about what it means to

117
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:53,501
be a living thing in the cosmos.
Would it means to have this place in

118
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,030
space?
As a great question?

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,960
Carry on.
