1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,990
Talking about three or four years old,
I drove Walgett time,

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,900
do all the time.
Every second.

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,403
I worked at my,
when I worked at my father's flowers to 

4
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:19,744
it,
he was at from the old country and he 

5
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:25,000
was a Greek immigrant law with my 
mother.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,110
But when I worked at,
I worked at a store.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,690
I just had a good week.
A shot always did.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,990
I drew all the time.
And when I was in the store and I wasn't

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,620
actually working,
I was drawing,

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,191
drawing,
drawing,

11
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:39,880
drawing,
drawing.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,730
Yeah.
It was at a high school music and art.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,280
I call it the greatest school of 
learning since Alexander sat at the feet

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,250
of aristotle.
Uh,

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,910
but,
uh,

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,310
uh,
I took design courses,

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,390
you a long history of art courses along 
with academic courses.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,900
And I had a flat for whatever that 
means,

19
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,124
but that the,
at the very beginning of the design 

20
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,820
courses,
they were,

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,080
uh,
basically,

22
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,620
uh,
you know,

23
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:17,150
kind of a retro,
uh,

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,100
uh,
you know,

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,050
condensed means and Herbert and Herbert 
matters and the poor clays.

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,883
And we did design with circles and then 
we did a design with circles and 

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,800
triangles and circles,
triangles,

28
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:30,634
squares,
etc.

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,910
Time.
And I'm aT the end of my very first term

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,560
after doing that for a term,
I go along with all my other courses.

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,791
Uh,
he,

32
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,030
uh,
uh,

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,003
mr pAtterson gave us an eight to a 
beautiful 18 by 24 sheet of strathmore 

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,140
expensive sheets must have cost at least
accordIng to those days,

35
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,930
which was big bucks.
And uh,

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,860
he said,
uh,

37
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,903
what we're going to do it in the next 
hour and a half will be a one half year 

38
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:03,550
mark for the term,
you know,

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,420
we had done dozens and dozens of them 
and he said,

40
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,700
um,
and the subject,

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,720
this time is rectangles,
period.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,753
And everybody started to.
And I just sat there for an hour and a 

43
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,174
half and I didn't move,
just kind of looked around the room and 

44
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,510
he was furious,
you know,

45
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:29,800
you could see walking around with it.

46
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,600
Everybody visited help cutting out 
squares and you know,

47
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,880
and to a shape.
He had dual doing mala bitches,

48
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:40,290
you know,
malibu red shaped for blue chip.

49
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,990
And I didn't move and a lady said time's
up and he started to pick up english,

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,460
but she was turning red and he came up 
to me to me any,

51
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,490
any went that grabbed my 18 by 24 sheet 
and I said,

52
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,380
hold that,
met it Mr.

53
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,560
Patterson.
And I go by my name,

54
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,394
my signature in the corner,
and I handed him a 18 by 24 rectangle 

55
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,190
and he still didn't get it.
He was furious and tornado.

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,440
And I said,
oh my god,

57
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,610
he didn't get it.
I,

58
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,444
oh boy.
and I came into the next morning and 

59
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,810
there were two or three teachers in the 
hallway who stopped me and they said,

60
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,733
george,
what you get for mr patterson's class 

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,130
was brilliant.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,710
So he obviously had gone into the locker
room,

63
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,620
was somethIng you and as they will leave
in school.

64
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,950
And he said that george lois,
he said,

65
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,660
terrific student athletes.
He to an 18 by 20.

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,510
Yeah.
He really did nothing.

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,460
He just had to be an 18 by 24 rectangle.
Anyway,

68
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,563
that was kind of a.
I've always said that was my epiphany 

69
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,500
myself and induced an epiphany when I,
when I realized that,

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,470
uh,
and,

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,760
and I made the public who relate to high
school of music and art that any,

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,230
that,
any problem,

73
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,780
any design problem and a communications 
problem,

74
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,470
that there's a chance to do something 
unusual,

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,880
exciting,
dramatic,

76
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,540
unique,
um,

77
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,280
and um,
and I,

78
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,270
and my whole career is based on the fact
that everything I work on,

79
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,860
what I have to create,
whether it's a advertisement or,

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,110
you know,
a,

81
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,210
a,
a,

82
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,600
a music video,
a magazine cover,

83
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,150
promotion piece,
uh,

84
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,403
that the,
that the got to be totally surprising 

85
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,330
and unique and almost and thrilling.

86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,460
I'm a social somehow in that first year 
at,

87
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,450
at,
at high school in Michigan on,

88
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,270
I knew I was going to be some kind of a.
I'm a commUnicator,

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,550
a designer,
and,

90
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,960
and also,
uh,

91
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,020
uh,
I wish really inspired me greatly by,

92
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:06,940
uh,
uh,

93
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,260
the work of paul rand who at that tiMe,
uh,

94
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,783
uh,
that was 45 and I was 14 years old and 

95
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,660
he must've been like 26 or something.
He was wanting to king.

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,100
Uh,
and he,

97
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,060
uh,
was,

98
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,440
he was a writing and creating his own 
advertising for People for,

99
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,370
for uh,
uh,

100
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,450
clients like all backs and he was doing 
an ibm logos,

101
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:32,360
et cetera.
And um,

102
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,073
he was turning to look at his work.
not that my work is anything near what 

103
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,164
his is,
but,

104
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,610
um,
I,

105
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,370
uh,
I was thrilled with the idea that a,

106
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,450
a,
that you could work in a,

107
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,570
as a communicator,
as a designer,

108
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,510
as an advertising guy and uh,
and,

109
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,410
and create your own work and not be a 
whore and not,

110
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,620
and not do a,
you have awful,

111
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,730
terrible work.
so that,

112
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,573
that.

113
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,620
Well,
I started in advertising.

114
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,190
I after highschool and music and art,
uh,

115
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,450
that was,
that was basically my,

116
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,284
uh,
my graphic arts training as far as I'm 

117
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,790
concerned.
They was in for incredible years.

118
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,020
uh,
I then went to a it to it and I,

119
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,400
uh,
and it,

120
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,263
uh,
I met my future wife that first day of 

121
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,600
school and I was nuts about it.
And um,

122
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,810
I realized they have to want it to after
a weekend of attracted,

123
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,160
they weren't anywhere near as good as 
the high school music and art.

124
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,090
But I stuck it out because I went,
I went into buy the lever and um,

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,000
I went to the first year and then the 
second year I,

126
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,231
I,
you know,

127
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,064
I didn't cry.
I didn't quite know what to do when I 

128
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,540
can,
because I know the school was so awful.

129
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,790
And um,
but I want to buy first clashes.

130
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,970
At the second year they had a,
again,

131
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,790
I ran into another great mentor,
a male teacher,

132
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,990
but marsha levitt and he looked at me 
and he was,

133
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,140
he showed what I did for him and he 
said,

134
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,130
george,
yes,

135
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,720
and why in school and I should,
I'm trying to make a living,

136
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,960
you know,
and he shed,

137
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,830
get out of,
you're not going to learn any more here.

138
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,664
And he gave me a pivot of piece of paper
with a woman's name who had had a woman 

139
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:15,784
art director,
which are very unique back then who had 

140
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,030
an art studio.
And she sent me to him the next night.

141
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,590
The next morning I and I left school in 
Michigan in before my,

142
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,623
actually my first seven years started.
I'm a show and achieved good promotion 

143
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,310
and advertising,
etc.

144
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,380
It was a great,
great first job because she would have a

145
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,530
superbug designer.

146
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,010
It shows what happened was I lost my 
exemption for the army.

147
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:47,201
It was during the korean war and I got 
drafted and a lot of going to Korea came

148
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,470
back alive.
And um,

149
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,193
uh,
she wanted me to be a partner with her 

150
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,140
but I didn't want to.
And she said,

151
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,974
what do you want to do?
I really want to work at cbs television 

152
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:00,914
because there was a really dynamic time 
with her incorporate imagery and 

153
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,840
corporate design with the great bill 
golden that,

154
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:09,800
the head of it.
Okay.

155
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,280
Just if they had just done the cbhi.
So I went into,

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,660
at cbs and it was a,
I tell you,

157
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,810
hey,
of design and advertising,

158
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,033
but somehow it wasn't a big,
it wasn't big time advertising to go 

159
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:23,160
with,
uh,

160
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,310
you know,
we worked on products,

161
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,990
etc.
And from then,

162
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,890
so I left there,
you know,

163
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:29,724
and,
and bill golden a shed to me in 

164
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,430
[inaudible] 53 or four,
whatever it was,

165
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,264
54.

166
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,160
Uh,
george,

167
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:42,170
you can't go out there.
It's a world that the world is terrible.

168
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,960
They will feel exchange.
They will hatch.

169
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,190
And he was right,
you know,

170
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,750
um,
he said,

171
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:48,584
you not going to be happy,
they're not going to appreciate your 

172
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,630
talented and I should.
Well,

173
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,320
I,
I,

174
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,750
somehow something drove me to,
to do it and uh,

175
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,260
you know,
I,

176
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,060
I went and I went and I had that I had 
the job I went to was pretty awful.

177
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,450
And I ended a lot of,
a lot of stories,

178
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,343
a seemingly are apocryphal,
but actually true when I kind of acted 

179
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,400
up in my first agency,
can overturned the desk at shadows,

180
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,560
did some kind of crazy stuff that,
uh,

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
after that I,
uh,

182
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,443
I went and I worked with somebody great.
The other greAt pioneers in advertising 

183
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,630
in and in an inadvertent designer.
Her blue bow and I worked there.

184
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,750
Then I went to the door,
then brought back and work with them for

185
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:37,340
bill burn back into and bob gauge and,
and um,

186
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,960
and so and,
and again,

187
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,670
I guess something insane,
uh,

188
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,223
uh,
I left doyle dane to a bar back and I 

189
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,094
told him I was leaving to start the 
second creative agency and work with 

190
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,920
bill back and started the only creative 
agency where the reason I started it,

191
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,173
it was based on the fact that he had 
worked with paul rand early in his 

192
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:01,120
career and somehow he understood that 
for your work,

193
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:01,954
but good to have a graphic designer,
especially a one who is prolific and 

194
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,793
could write like poetry in that you 
could do better advertising if you 

195
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:11,920
worked,
if,

196
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,490
if the,
if there are automatic,

197
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,343
the could work,
could conceive advertising with the 

198
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:18,294
writer,
which up to that time basically all 

199
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:23,220
advertising was a attractor.

200
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,063
Sat in a room with his stomach was and 
waited for the creative director for 

201
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,030
the,
for the copywriter come in.

202
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,163
So I'm a piece of paper and say,
make a layout yet later shout and the 

203
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,790
layout,
you know,

204
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,010
the typical awful,
you know,

205
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,570
unambitious layout.
So I left oil.

206
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,480
Dan brought back when I left orlando 
brown back,

207
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,040
bill bernbach said to me,
george,

208
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,640
you don't know what's out there.
Uh,

209
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:51,474
you know,
uh,

210
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,300
uh,
uh,

211
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,080
the uh,
uh,

212
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,563
you know,
they,

213
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,033
they,
they,

214
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,043
and he,
and he literally shut that door they 

215
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,140
brought back,
which was basically a creative freak.

216
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,220
They,
that they come,

217
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:06,054
how they were miraculous.
A group of people as somehow together 

218
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,360
could forge a great advertising and it 
couldn't happen again.

219
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,530
Uh,
not in,

220
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,363
not in this philistine world,
but I started the agency called pepper 

221
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,970
kang.
Lois was that west to writers actually.

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,833
And um,
and we were successful almost 

223
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,890
immediately,
almost immediately.

224
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,910
And,
and then after a couple of few ca,

225
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,893
one,
two to three years coming out of all my 

226
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,780
say what to other agencies,
uh,

227
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:37,470
you know,
uh,

228
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,410
you know,
call allie and slos.

229
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,333
And then another guy left my agency and 
started going into business with Mary 

230
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,030
Wells and started married,
know well,

231
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,100
which green and before you knew it by 
the mitch by the mid sixties,

232
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,360
uh,
uh,

233
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,213
you know,
I realized that I had triggered with 

234
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,130
starting not second,
the creative agency.

235
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,023
I had triggered something call the 
creative evolution in advertising and 

236
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,320
um,
and uh,

237
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,990
and,
and it,

238
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,500
it,
it became the,

239
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,940
uh,
the uh,

240
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,410
golden age of,
uh,

241
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,581
of,
of,

242
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,414
of advertising in the sixties and 
seventies basically was a golden age of 

243
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,830
advertising and advertising.

244
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,220
This been,
uh,

245
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,440
you know,
uh,

246
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,330
think I hate the show,
which is true.

247
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,730
Um,
you know,

248
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:31,564
when I first started the show well 
before to me that I got a call from one 

249
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:38,110
of the producers and he said,
you know,

250
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:42,340
we're looking at where we're shooting.
We're doing little spots with the people

251
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:45,190
who were the original mad men.
He said,

252
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,253
of the period ending I was shooting.
And then they'd named for five or six 

253
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,060
people and I'd never heard of a couple 
of them.

254
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,690
and I'm a andw ,
w,

255
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,410
w,
wherever,

256
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,720
whoever we talked to.
But matches your name.

257
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,554
I said,
time out.

258
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,630
You're doing a show on the advertising 
section.

259
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,570
You'd never heard my name.
He had on order.

260
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,150
We've heard out of bullshit.
You never heard my name as well.

261
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,220
Uh,
okay.

262
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,040
I said,
if you want to know what happened in the

263
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:13,874
sixties,
if you wanted a real understanding what 

264
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,144
happened at 60.

265
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,830
I did a book in 1972 called george.
Be careful,

266
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,470
which is basically a,
you know,

267
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,380
my story about,
uh,

268
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,111
you know,
uh,

269
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:31,111
going up in New York and growing up in 
the New York school of design,

270
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:36,430
I became what it is one to in New York 
shoulder and how I started,

271
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,503
you know,
uh,

272
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,800
the creative agency world and how that 
became the but,

273
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,420
but,
but it's all about the center.

274
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,060
And um,
and I call the george be careful because

275
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:47,980
when I was a kid,
uh,

276
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:48,814
you know,
I remember the hand of god coming into 

277
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,600
my,
into my bedroom.

278
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,170
We'll michelangelo's hand said good 
george,

279
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,370
be careful.
And my mother's,

280
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,580
my mother told me,
Georgia all my life.

281
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,490
My mother told me,
my father,

282
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,580
my sisters and my coaches and sports.
My,

283
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,423
uh,
uh,

284
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,100
my,
uh,

285
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,140
when I went into the army and I told him
to be careful and then again,

286
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,340
when you go into advertising,
so that's when everybody tells you to be

287
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,174
careful,
you know,

288
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,460
anything,
anything unusual,

289
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,040
anything over the top,
anything edgy,

290
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,510
you can't do that.

291
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,910
So if there would george be careful with
my anti slow anti slogan and if you want

292
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:33,361
to know anything about the advertising 
in the sixties and the appetite,

293
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,500
he read that book goodbye.
You know,

294
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:36,951
and I,
you know,

295
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:37,784
I wish I could fuck you.
And I called it and he called me back a 

296
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,234
couple of days later.
I told him to go get the book on amazon 

297
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,050
because it was out of her.
He called me up a couple of days later.

298
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,080
They say,
oh jesus,

299
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,050
wow.
We could have done a show on that.

300
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,220
I didn't know shit,
you know,

301
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,770
because of course that would think the 
sixties.

302
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,413
Anybody who knows anything,
the media world and anything know 

303
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,983
anything about it.
When you mentioned the sixties and you 

304
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,714
mentioned advertising in the sixties,
they don't think now they think of the 

305
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,613
madman,
of that thumb show before that they 

306
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:11,210
thought of it as a lower gauge of 
really,

307
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,073
uh,
uh,

308
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,940
of the eight that I was talking to you 
about,

309
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:14,774
about drinking or you know,
when you're leaving doyle dane bernbach 

310
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:21,200
and doe and burbank with a giant part of
it obviously.

311
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,243
And then with the other three or four 
agency after that came out of my agency 

312
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,983
that was the most a roll cage in media 
communications since the year 10 to 12 

313
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,910
of the 12 apostles.

314
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,360
Well,
um,

315
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,490
just to oversimplify,
the big idea is to,

316
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:44,324
is the,
uh,

317
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,820
is the,
is the,

318
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,900
is,
is a concept that,

319
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,030
that,
that takes the unique selling,

320
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,073
the unique virtues of a product and,
and shaping it into somebody's into 

321
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:07,511
people's minds a that somehow forces a,
a,

322
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,963
a,
a extraordinary sales increase in 

323
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,500
whatever you're talking about.
Uh,

324
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,520
but,
you know,

325
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:20,030
and I always talk about the big idea.
I'm kind of call the best of mr.

326
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,280
Big idea.
Um,

327
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,770
you know,
but what I'm really talking about is,

328
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:26,870
uh,
is to creativity and I,

329
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:30,680
and I say creativity can shovel almost 
any problem,

330
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,001
you know,
the,

331
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,070
uh,
you know,

332
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,440
the creative act,
there's free of habit by originality can

333
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,274
overcome everything.
But at the same time that I talk about 

334
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,580
the creative act,
I really,

335
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,423
I really tell people who are,
who are trying to be to create a work 

336
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,340
that creativity isn't really a creative 
active back to discovery.

337
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,800
And they look at you like her,
you know.

338
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,840
Um,
and I,

339
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,310
I did a book called,
um,

340
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,130
george on his creation of the big idea,
you know,

341
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:01,964
where I show 100 things.
I did on the right hand patient on the 

342
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:08,570
left hand page before I show something 
in my dna.

343
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:11,500
Something in my understanding of,
of a shutdown in years of,

344
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,450
of,
of,

345
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,283
of,
uh,

346
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,780
something of my understanding of,
uh,

347
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,160
of,
of movies,

348
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,010
of ballet,
of a sports show,

349
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,873
but have a fumo of dirty jokes.
Whenever it is something in there that 

350
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,900
inspired what I did.
And I tell,

351
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,170
I tell the young people especially,
um,

352
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,153
you know,
uh,

353
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,270
uh,
that,

354
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,770
that background that,
uh,

355
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:34,271
that,
uh,

356
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,104
of,
of high art and pop art at an 

357
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:40,260
intellectual background of understanding
the world around you when,

358
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:40,830
uh,
and uh,

359
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,370
and,
and,

360
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,940
and,
and especially,

361
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,893
uh,
you know,

362
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,810
the 7,000
years of art is,

363
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,350
is,
is,

364
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,650
uh,
is,

365
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,960
is essential to doing creative work 
that,

366
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:58,200
some of that and that one,
once you have that,

367
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,930
that understanding,
you know,

368
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,010
and,
and that,

369
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,860
that ssl of,
of,

370
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,030
of,
of,

371
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,300
of trying to understand everything when 
you have any kind of a problem,

372
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,310
if you then look at the problem and look
at the competitor and etc,

373
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,410
then look at it and get your basic 
information.

374
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Once you really understand the problem,
the answer is the answer was there.

375
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,510
It's like floating by,
you know,

376
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,363
you got to do is grab it.
It really isn't an act of creativity 

377
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:35,760
from active discovery.
I sound very mystical talking about it,

378
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,594
but I absolutely,
that's absolutely what creativity is to 

379
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,680
me.
I fight,

380
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:45,450
learn all there is to learn about 
something and I know I'm ready to,

381
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,730
to,
to come up with an answer.

382
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,690
It's there and it's not a bolt of 
lightening what it is,

383
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,190
it's coming out of your own,
uh,

384
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,150
out of your own essential belief in own 
understanding of the world.

385
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,760
The method is,
uh,

386
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,390
is to be interested in everything.
And the,

387
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,420
and the organic part of it is the 
passion for,

388
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,540
for everything around you.
The passion for,

389
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,410
you know,
I mean,

390
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,530
I know when I,
when I teach a class,

391
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,423
you know,
at school of visual arts as a favor to 

392
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,900
somebody and I'll,
I'll stay till clashes,

393
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,450
get 25 kids,
uh,

394
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,350
once the,
uh,

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,950
uh,
one,

396
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,190
the,
if any,

397
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,750
have been to the museum of metropolitan 
museum of art did here.

398
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,923
Okay.
Have you ever been to the moment this 

399
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,450
year?
One hand?

400
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Uh,
and if had anybody have any of you never

401
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,360
been to a museum but not,
not,

402
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,840
you know,
five people,

403
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:49,674
eight people,
you know,

404
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,670
I must style.
Did you know,

405
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,430
I'm just truly astounded,
you know,

406
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,593
talking to design students,
people who were supposed to be 

407
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:57,540
communicated,
you know,

408
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:02,060
you don't know,
you know,

409
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,933
that total.

410
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,490
And that's why when people say today,
wednesday,

411
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,310
the second agent,
the second a credible solution to know,

412
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,511
I said,
I mean,

413
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:17,340
you got,
you got the,

414
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,290
he got the internet and you've got 
google,

415
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:23,580
we got all the information at your 
fingertips to know and nobody they don't

416
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,990
know shit.
Nobody knows shit.

417
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,623
You know,
one of the classic books and 

418
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:32,664
advertising,
one of the great books and advertising 

419
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,910
the confessions of an ad man.
Uh,

420
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,711
you know,
by,

421
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,060
uh,
by uh,

422
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,950
uh,
david ogleby,

423
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,090
every word in there is the wrong 
absolutely wrong.

424
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,263
We want in.
When I was working at doyle dane 

425
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,754
bernbach in 1959,
I got conned by his copy chief into 

426
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,570
coming to see ogilvy and I said,
I should do.

427
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,150
You're talking to the wrong guy.
Yeah,

428
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,970
I mean,
uh,

429
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,010
uh,
and they.

430
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,030
And he begged me to come and I went and 
uh,

431
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,900
ogilvy's trying to hire me as their head
art director.

432
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,763
You know,
I think at one point I said I need to 

433
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:14,290
head off to act different if I could 
become the they creative creative chief.

434
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,250
He was the creative chief,
creative chief.

435
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,490
I could,
I could do great arbit sizing.

436
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

437
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,720
But,
and I told him,

438
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:25,710
I said,
mr olubayi,

439
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,360
I don't know why you're trying to hire 
me because I don't understand one word.

440
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,800
It,
I don't believe I don't,

441
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,810
I don't agree with one word in your 
book.

442
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,390
I mean he had,
you know,

443
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,430
here's the rules of addition to the 
logo.

444
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:36,610
It's got to be here.
And he's got me.

445
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,450
He's got rules.
There are no rules and advertise.

446
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,140
It's impossible.
You know,

447
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,710
I mean,
the only rule in advertising,

448
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,170
if there are no rules,
you know,

449
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,750
the best of what shanti and our look at 
the new standard,

450
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,290
you know,
I mean it's a company of a,

451
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,633
of a,
of a famous people have people want to 

452
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:08,320
be famous with blurbs all around it and 
supposed to be.

453
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,563
And uh,
you know,

454
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,700
just fuck that.
Supposed to be creativity in journalism.

455
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:14,320
My god,
it's unbelievable.

456
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,750
It's shocking.
I mean,

457
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,700
how can,
how can 200 magazines,

458
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,500
you know,
do the same cover,

459
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,423
you know,
that's always there and advertise to go 

460
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,344
home and watch advertise.
I watch avatar commercials on tv and I 

461
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:31,340
don't really,
I,

462
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,130
I'm not kidding.
I don't really,

463
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,550
I don't really understand what,
what the hell.

464
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,623
I mean half of them,
I don't understand what they're talking 

465
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:40,680
about.
Yeah.

466
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,610
And,
and most people don't understand,

467
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,400
even if they see something that they 
kind of enjoy,

468
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,560
they don't remember the name of the 
product,

469
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,580
you know?
So I mean,

470
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,414
I think,
uh,

471
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,580
I don't,
I don't see any,

472
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,830
I mean these people to keep talking 
about,

473
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,250
we're on the advent of coming up with 
the creative evolution.

474
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,250
I don't see it.
You know,

475
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,950
I don't.
At the same time,

476
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,630
I know there's got to be content that 
they,

477
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,493
I don't,
I'm not sure who's telling them what to 

478
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:04,984
do.

479
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,950
Yeah.
You have to have an understanding.

480
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,523
You have to understand,
have an that everything that I got back 

481
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:15,700
to what I said before,
everything you do,

482
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,880
you have to have a shower from.
If you come up with an idea,

483
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,160
a big idea it,
if you,

484
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,860
if you show it to somebody,
your wife,

485
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,490
your friend or a client,
they should go holy shit.

486
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,470
They shave your head coach and go back 
and forth,

487
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,983
you know,
it should be such to be such and such a 

488
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,894
surprising idea.
The only chance you have to do anything 

489
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:37,784
unless you remember bullshit.
It has to be a shock when you first see 

490
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,620
it,
you know,

491
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,230
and what people do is they,
they,

492
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,410
they,
they just.

493
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,230
So the,
so the work is so unAmbitious,

494
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,400
you know,
uh,

495
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,890
I mean television commercials are little
films,

496
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,273
you know,
something's going on and you don't know 

497
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,880
what's going on and you say,
well,

498
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,840
what is it about?

499
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,600
And then you're looking for who the 
client is.

500
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,220
And then when you see it,
you say,

501
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,900
oh,
I don't get it.

502
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,903
You know,
um,

503
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,120
shot that night trying to,
to.

504
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,040
It's a wasteland of creativity 
unfortunately.

505
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,250
And I can't believe they didn't talent 
that day because I know I pay people.

506
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,170
I have fans profess,
you know,

507
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,393
a love of my work at set of a set of 
standard kind of be something you gotta 

508
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,630
learn from it.
I went and got to be learning from it is

509
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,570
that when you do something,
it should be,

510
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,140
it should be a knock out,
an idea,

511
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,490
you know,
and,

512
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,330
and in most cases,
certainly in the,

513
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,200
certainly in an editorial and in which I
already did for 10 years for esquire and

514
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,280
I and I,
you know,

515
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:42,900
and then now in the museum or not,
but,

516
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,763
but,
uh,

517
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,290
but you have to,
you know,

518
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,740
when you're,
every cover is when it hit,

519
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,710
when it was on a newsstand,
peep some people.

520
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,870
WhAt I mean,
the,

521
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,460
the culture went ape shit on to,
on some of them.

522
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,600
They looked at It like,
whoa,

523
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,120
um,
um,

524
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,300
you know,
go to a new standard today.

525
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,990
There's not a metal boat.
Forget about something being culturally,

526
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,723
being a culture busta.
There's nothing there that you could 

527
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,063
possibly remember.
There's an lead today in about her that 

528
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,760
today,
but with three magazines I talk about,

529
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,870
they're getting awards,
etc.

530
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,390
Etc.
And you look at the covers and uh,

531
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,930
uh,
I don't know nothing,

532
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,470
you know,
they're all the same cover,

533
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,383
you know.

534
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,840
No,
that's the,

535
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,830
that's the big problem,
you know,

536
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,664
I mean,
I'm talking about people or about a 

537
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,610
young design is not,
not being ambitious enough,

538
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:41,270
etc.
Etc.

539
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,910
One of the problems is,
is that,

540
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,510
uh,
you know,

541
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,580
certainly in,
in magazine design,

542
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,710
there's a lot of terrific talent,
uh,

543
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,210
doing editorial.
I mean,

544
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:53,200
when you get this society publication 
designer sends via,

545
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,510
there were awards every year,
a book,

546
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,480
you know,
and uh,

547
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,930
and you look through it.
And if I've terrific spreads in it,

548
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,630
a lot of exciting stuff going on,
you know,

549
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,760
there's talent there and then they 
showed the best coverage of the year and

550
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,860
at they are nothing,
you know,

551
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,160
everything who was the editor,
uh,

552
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,950
you know,
Carolyn Hayes came to me.

553
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,933
He had just basically taken over the 
ship of their magazine even though he 

554
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,970
had been responsible for the last five 
or six or seven issues.

555
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,410
And uh,
he,

556
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:25,244
he had,
he had been leading in 1960 in 1962 

557
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,001
about,
uh,

558
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:29,880
my,
uh,

559
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,170
my ad agency.
And they,

560
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,790
and the reason he,
it struck them was because it was an art

561
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,700
director with the first ad agency 
publication lowish,

562
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,570
where there was an art director in the,
in,

563
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,140
in a,
in a masthead.

564
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,280
And the stories were all my advertising,
you know,

565
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,730
every month there was a big story in the
New York times,

566
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,564
at least about campaigns I had done.
So he was looking at the avid art 

567
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:57,420
directors are exciting work and 
something made him call me,

568
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,300
uh,
to get advice on how to do coverage.

569
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,400
I'd never done a cover in my life.
and,

570
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,200
and when he called me,
I what I saw him,

571
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,034
I didn't,
I didn't know.

572
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,903
I thought he was trying to get 
advertising for our ad agency and I was 

573
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,303
being nice to talk to them because I had
been reading a magazine and it was a 

574
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,733
terrific magazine.

575
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,250
And he and he basically said,
I need advice,

576
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,120
how do you.
And I said,

577
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:18,990
well,
how do you do them now?

578
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,070
How do you do your covers now?
He said,

579
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,090
well,
you know,

580
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,520
a five,
you know,

581
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,000
four or five or saturday and sit down 
with,

582
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,450
for their three or four feet out in 
november,

583
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:30,990
we have a long discussion about,
and we try to come up with the,

584
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:31,760
uh,
the,

585
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,370
the,
uh,

586
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,370
what topic and the issue of coming up 
should be the subject of a color.

587
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,900
I said,
yeah.

588
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,510
And then he said,
and that we owe to go away.

589
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:43,920
We come back two,
three days later,

590
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:44,754
we,
each of us,

591
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,753
uh,
have one or two ideas on what the cover 

592
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:51,870
should be and maybe it's five or six of 
them that we really don't quite know.

593
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,280
So we pick them out,
we comp them up.

594
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:54,540
And I said,
oh my god,

595
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,710
goop,
fucking grope.

596
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,173
And he said,
huh?

597
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,190
I said,
group grope.

598
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,573
I said that you have to,
when you're work with a male and police 

599
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,310
and,
and,

600
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:06,070
uh,
you know,

601
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,480
and I said,
no,

602
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,500
of course not.
I said,

603
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:11,334
well,
obviously you don't have anybody there 

604
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:15,660
who knows how to somebody younger 
constitutionally,

605
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,160
howard,
why don't we do this?

606
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,343
So go out.
And basically I was saying get a 

607
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,130
freelancer.
So he said,

608
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,390
well,
how do you.

609
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,111
I said,
well,

610
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:25,880
you know,
uh,

611
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,410
you got to get somebody who understands 
the culture,

612
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,860
who's kind of added a culture,
who,

613
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:31,980
uh,
who's literate,

614
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,040
uh,
who,

615
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,970
who understands,
who loves politics,

616
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,140
who loves to,
you know,

617
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:40,510
who likes,
loves the opera theater,

618
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,380
music,
and uh,

619
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,740
and uh,
and,

620
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,170
and,
uh,

621
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,003
you know,
when you tell a dirty joke and he know 

622
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,490
spark somebody understands the culture 
and,

623
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,713
and I,
and I shot to give them a couple of 

624
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,960
names that make with people might be 
able to do it.

625
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,760
And he said he was,
he was southern southern liberal,

626
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,950
kind of an oxymoron.
And he said,

627
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,110
hey pal,
can you do me one favor?

628
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,130
I don't know what the hell you're 
talking about.

629
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:10,131
Can you do me one cover and the one 
cover?

630
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,080
Uh,
and uh,

631
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,253
I said,
once you get a bunch of next day she 

632
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:16,500
would do,
went to the next cover,

633
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,071
do.
And he said,

634
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,900
next tuesday,
but now let me give you time.

635
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,540
I said,
I'll do it for next tuesday.

636
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,570
What's an issue?

637
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,810
I don't have it here.
I said,

638
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,290
describe it to tell it,
to scan a sentence for each story.

639
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,470
So told me this,
this,

640
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,300
this,
this,

641
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,200
and one of the things he mentioned was,
um,

642
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,603
uh,
a spread with a photo and a short piece 

643
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,150
on floyd patterson,
who was a champion of the world.

644
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,193
And sonny liston was the challenger and 
floyd was in the upcoming fight with a 

645
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,650
big favorite big five to one favorite 
too fast for listing the shadow shadow.

646
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,490
Um,
and I said,

647
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,070
well,
surely issues that have come out,

648
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,103
uh,
the issue will come out a week before 

649
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,400
the fight.
I said,

650
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,280
okay.
I went away and I did a cover.

651
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:09,250
I got a guy who looked like a,
like,

652
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,550
like patterson,
you know,

653
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,690
six foot,
not too muscly.

654
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,700
And I showed him and a call the fight.
I basically shut.

655
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:19,534
Everybody was wrong about it and he's 
not gonna win the fight and he's going 

656
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,224
to get,
you're going to get destroyed by 

657
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:23,800
linkedin.

658
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,480
And I show parish and laying flat,
you know,

659
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,730
in the middle of the ring,
left for dead.

660
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,440
You know,
nobody,

661
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,120
nobody in the arena,
the,

662
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,100
the,
his handlers are gone.

663
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,870
The pressure's gone,
20,000

664
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,880
people are gone and it was a metaphor 
for a metaphor,

665
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,300
not only for sports but boxing,
you know,

666
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,110
you lose your,
if you're losing it,

667
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,103
you're dead,
you know,

668
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,500
and uh,
but a metaphor for any walk of life,

669
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,610
you know,
when you're lucia,

670
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:57,250
they leave me for dead.
I'm anyway.

671
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,260
And I and I and,
and the cover and w when he shut,

672
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,510
he called me up and he showed my god I 
never saw a couple of my life.

673
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:08,660
And I said,
yeah,

674
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,080
right.
HE said,

675
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,360
but you're calling the fighting.
No shit,

676
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,160
you're crazy.
Supposedly long.

677
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:23,161
I said 50 slash 50 chance to right know.
And if I'm right,

678
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,110
you're a genius and if a long time you 
know,

679
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,093
hey,
you know,

680
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,500
you played the game but I had on blight,
you know,

681
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,350
I've been told that I am absolutely 
right.

682
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,700
And anyway,
he,

683
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,830
I found out many years later he ran 
because he said he would quit if he,

684
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:45,541
if a publisher turned it down,
which in fact when the issue came out,

685
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,070
the publisher on king rich wrote a 
editorial saying,

686
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,100
you cover,
she our cover.

687
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,890
We have nothing to do with it,
you know,

688
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,880
and it's absolutely true.
Anyway,

689
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,360
when the cover came out,
when,

690
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,650
when the issue came out,
the,

691
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:02,350
uh,
every,

692
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,243
it was a laughing stock in the sports 
world and they hold the young five or 

693
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:12,370
six days later listening,
destroyed them and they were junior ship

694
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,040
landed the biggest douche standard sales
history.

695
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,590
And found out later there were guys,
uh,

696
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,040
the that I've met only a couple of years
ago.

697
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,910
They said when I,
when the cover came out,

698
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,760
they thought it was.
She ended up esquire because they didn't

699
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,040
almost unexpected paycheck.
Anyway.

700
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,140
They were so deeply and read the 
magazine.

701
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,670
I found out later that they were really 
in trouble naturally.

702
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,993
And what happened from the time I 
started doing a coverage to for almost 

703
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:49,600
10 years is to show the circulation went
from 500,000

704
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,620
to 2 million and uh,
you know,

705
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,320
and,
and,

706
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,150
and w with cover after cover,
uh,

707
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,690
you know,
some incredibly controversial,

708
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,860
uh,
but you know,

709
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,270
any math,
the only mash magazine in America that,

710
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,750
that dad speak out against the Vietnam 
war.

711
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,790
And in fact,
we,

712
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,630
we,
we,

713
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,710
we were tHe leading,
uh,

714
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,810
we were the leading people in the media,
in,

715
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,770
in,
in America against the Vietnam war.

716
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,720
And,
uh,

717
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,553
and in the support of muhammad ali,
which I would've hated to a fighter at 

718
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,300
the time of,
uh,

719
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,250
after it became a muslim and a and a,
and refused to fight in,

720
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,850
in that terrible war,
you know,

721
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,913
so,
uM,

722
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,170
uh,
and,

723
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,053
and,
and it only happened because of page 

724
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,240
because people say,
boy,

725
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:42,730
he took trump boss covers when I was in 
boston,

726
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,110
the recovered it took him boss to run 
it,

727
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,220
you know.

728
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,490
And in fact,
you know,

729
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,400
uh,
you know,

730
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,560
I said I'd call them up and I'd say a 
watch.

731
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,190
I was sending a cover that one.
And I,

732
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,850
and I always chose my own shop,
a topic for what he showed me.

733
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:01,390
Sometimes he show,
he talked about the,

734
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,440
uh,
what was coming up with a magazine.

735
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,274
And I,
and I knew the topic that he was 

736
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,820
basically excited about with the one I 
had to do because it was that important.

737
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,050
But in many times I,
I picked the,

738
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,830
you know,
like that cover I did,

739
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,580
like I told you about for the first 
issue with listed,

740
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,710
whether it was just the spread that they
put it in at the last Minute,

741
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:22,710
you know,
but,

742
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,990
uh,
uh,

743
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,320
but I,
I call him up and I say,

744
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,120
I said I about the get the high world 
and uh,

745
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,180
and I said this one's going to read and 
get us in trouble and didn't say,

746
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,520
yeah,
you know,

747
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,740
and when I'm in trouble,
I meant a,

748
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,713
he would lose,
not only would it be get bombed to his 

749
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,960
bike saturdays and congressmen and god 
knows who and,

750
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,551
and,
and,

751
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:45,830
and.

752
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,050
Right.
And people writing in your death threats

753
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,380
sometimes,
you know,

754
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,990
losing a advertising client because he 
had,

755
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,760
they had many clients down southville 
where they get a lot of uh,

756
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,470
uh,
you know,

757
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,770
men's wear and a lot of mills went down 
south and,

758
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,763
and,
and there was a time of the jim crow 

759
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:10,810
south.
I mean,

760
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,310
it was a time of real racism going on in
America with dick.

761
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,890
I wish racism in America,
but that,

762
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,340
which one?
It was a rabbit and ramping,

763
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,930
no,
it's changing for worse because I'm,

764
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,960
um,
somehow,

765
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,300
you know,
growing up with the internet and growing

766
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,760
up on the stuff on the screen and 
filling it,

767
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,970
filling the page with information,
look at,

768
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,860
look at motion magazines,
state,

769
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,300
look at even the great magazines today,
you know,

770
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,430
and like a vanity fair.
It's just jammed with and New York that,

771
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,360
that is just jammed with information and
copy of cetera.

772
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,230
It's almost like it's an extension of,
of the tb,

773
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:58,080
of the,
of what people were used to.

774
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,410
I mean,
when you're talking about white space in

775
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,280
which we used to be a big thing in,
in,

776
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,850
in,
in school,

777
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:06,684
in graphic art school in god.
Yet we've tAlked about hate that white 

778
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,284
space.
But they knew what they were talking 

779
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:12,330
about.
They were talking about she,

780
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,390
which sometimes wait,
that's an idea that should,

781
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,080
that so that you need the expansIon you 
need to know.

782
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:20,914
And you know,
the great pioneers in advertise in 

783
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,473
editorial design in,
in the twenties and thirties was a guy 

784
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,550
named dr argo and alexey brodovitch for 
vogue magazine.

785
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:33,384
And,
um,

786
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,310
and uh,
you know,

787
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,163
the,
the irving penn's and avid dons and all 

788
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,660
graphic design learn somehow from that 
kind of experience of the,

789
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,351
of,
of,

790
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:45,741
uh,
of,

791
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:46,574
uh,
of a spread that had some kind of 

792
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,690
vitality to it.

793
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,840
And um,
and uh,

794
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,800
when you look at the internet,
there's a load of information,

795
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,873
but there's no,
they're not designed right calorie and 

796
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,680
then no attempt for design,
vitality.

797
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,080
I mean even most people's websites where
you have a chance to,

798
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,973
to do something,
to express something and it's not so 

799
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:15,864
much,
you know,

800
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,420
I'm not down on the ipad or whatever 
they do,

801
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,980
but I'm,
I'm,

802
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,180
I'm,
I'm for the magazine.

803
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,740
I fought a visual,
a excitement of magazine.

804
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,850
I mean,
to this day,

805
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,980
yeah,
when I get magazines and they don't have

806
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:34,140
to be even be a great magazine,
you know,

807
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,730
you turn the page read,
you know,

808
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,760
you know,
when you lay it on your,

809
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,790
when you lay it on your knees,
that's like a lap dance.

810
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,820
You know,
I mean,

811
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,880
it's a official thing,
you know,

812
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:46,790
and I can't see,
you know,

813
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,713
uh,
you know,

814
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,560
I mean if I was a really young,
a young man today,

815
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,990
a good to shape,
what would,

816
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,800
what would you do?

817
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,970
The website we do and I'd be,
I'd created a magazine.

818
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,720
Yeah.
I create a magazine,

819
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,300
have people say,
holy shit.

820
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,140
Did you see that cover?
Then open,

821
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:05,851
like,
wow,

822
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,830
we should do it.
It's the,

823
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,060
it's the,
it's the,

824
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,770
it's,
it's a,

825
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,900
it's a revolution in journalism,
you know,

826
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,920
the,
the,

827
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,780
a graphic dEsigner,
you know,

828
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,643
who,
who understands them ideas and 

829
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:19,314
understands that I,
that I did what their make that makes 

830
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,810
world go around,
could change the world with a magazine.

831
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:27,000
If it did one talent could do it right 
now.

832
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,590
And everybody was stopped at the 
magazines.

833
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,500
I've tried,
I've tried it.

834
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,800
It's funny because some people said,
well,

835
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:46,801
you know,
have you ever thought about cheyenne had

836
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,290
been,
you want a movie director or this,

837
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,031
of that?
And I said,

838
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:53,140
yeah,
well when I've able to beat it to be,

839
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:58,030
to work on and being a graphic designer 
and being an advertising,

840
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,230
etc.
It was,

841
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,820
I,
I,

842
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,610
I,
I,

843
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,950
I,
I've done hundreds,

844
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,420
thousands of commercials,
you know,

845
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,663
music,
video,

846
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,670
music,
video ever done to this day joke.

847
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:14,520
I'm in cocoa loaded still sessions,
the best music video ever.

848
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,611
Uh,
you know,

849
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:20,050
I thought that the shells,
films that would knock it down,

850
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:21,310
it was so exciting.
Uh,

851
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,690
you know,
I do,

852
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,750
I design logo design packages,
you know,

853
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,584
uh,
uh,

854
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,310
I,
I,

855
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:31,390
I designed an agency or a design space,
you know,

856
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,230
uh,
you know,

857
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,870
I mean every part of,
um,

858
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,260
uh,
you know,

859
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,130
uh,
I could,

860
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,840
I could be a renaissance man in a sense 
doing all of those things.

861
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,230
And um,
uh,

862
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
including,
um,

863
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,070
uh,
I,

864
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,903
the,
the,

865
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,803
the concept for New York magazine and 
actually the first design for the first 

866
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,044
logo for New York magazine I did as a 
supplement for the herald tribune in 

867
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:57,970
1962 or three.
Um,

868
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,130
and in fact it was at my office one day,
I think it was 63,

869
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:07,600
it might've been 62.
And,

870
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:08,434
uh,
he showed me working at a magazine and 

871
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:11,720
he said,
well,

872
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,130
what he,
he took,

873
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,990
what are you doing?
I didn't want to,

874
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,540
I'm,
I'm doing the,

875
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,374
I do the advertising for the New York 
herald tribune and he knew that because 

876
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,810
I was doing a very excited to paint who,
uh,

877
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,840
who says a newspaper has to be taught,
in fact,

878
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:29,860
that was producing a commercial for the 
tribune every night,

879
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,083
get the front page and,
and write a write a script and the 

880
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,050
shooting script in a cab and produce a 
commercial every night.

881
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,150
They would go on every night again,
in any case.

882
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,151
And I,
and I,

883
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,560
it was a big success and I said,
well,

884
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:49,150
I see the selling the hell out of the 
newspaper.

885
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,033
Uh,
danny paper,

886
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,680
the sunday paper,
I can't do anything with it.

887
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,533
Could,
you can't compete with the ties or 

888
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,223
they're sticking it in a show.
I've been doing a supplement of trying 

889
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:04,930
to get them to understand that they can 
do a supplement called New York.

890
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,383
And if you did it right,
you do a beautifully designed to get 

891
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,170
terrific writing,
etc cetera.

892
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,520
And it could be a combination of the,
of,

893
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,600
uh,
I said of the,

894
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,620
of the new yorker andq magazine,
you're telling you about specific things

895
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:20,794
to do,
uh,

896
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,150
and if you did that,
you know,

897
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:24,830
you can sell another 200,
300,000,

898
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,693
400,000
copies just because a terrific 

899
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,960
supplement.
And uh,

900
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,730
and lookIng at it,
and this was,

901
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,550
I've only been doing covers for them for
half a year or so.

902
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,220
And he said,
george,

903
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,470
if you,
if I left esquire right now and you left

904
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:49,190
your agency,
we should do this magazine and we should

905
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:53,880
do bag of scenes because it's a city 
magazine.

906
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:54,714
And he said,
and we could do a city magazine for 

907
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:58,400
seven or eight bucks,
here's a card preppy.

908
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,550
And I remember it was second saying,
holy shit,

909
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,730
that's a real big idea.
That's big thing.

910
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,010
And I've got hiM to do it.
But I had an ad agency and he and he was

911
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,910
doing.
But when you say why didn't,

912
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,390
why didn't I do it now?
I said,

913
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,224
well,
you know,

914
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,480
it's not that I'm old and tired because 
we actually don't.

915
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,800
I suPposedly retired in to the year 2000
and my wife says,

916
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:26,270
I'm not tired,
I'm just,

917
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,970
I'm not retired,
I'm just tired,

918
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,103
but I'm not because I work all the time.
I worked with my A look and we do stuff 

919
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,270
all the tIme with doing advertising.
Yeah,

920
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:40,271
we're working on a script and shooting 
script for a tv special,

921
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:41,940
a set,
et cetera,

922
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:43,280
et cetera.
but,

923
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:44,140
uh,
you know,

924
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,980
you have a hotel.
I might do a magazine.

925
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,160
I would have to do work with a,
a,

926
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,690
a direct,
a,

927
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:54,524
uh,
an editor who basically treated me the 

928
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:04,610
way howard and treated me as a,
as a big talent.

929
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,813
Uh,
he took me at least as good as he 

930
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:09,140
treats.
He treated the gates,

931
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,680
elise,
you know,

932
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,940
and that's what he did with me.
He said,

933
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:15,050
you know,
your ideal,

934
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:15,884
your ideal with the releases and the,
and the male is the initiative and the 

935
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,330
lowest isn't.
And they do that thing.

936
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,910
That doesn't mean he didn't edit those 
guys,

937
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,520
you know,
and which he absolutely did,

938
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,383
you know,
because even a great writer leach 

939
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,040
editing.
Um,

940
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,173
but,
uh,

941
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,310
uh,
he didn't edit it.

942
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,030
He didn't edit or change one thing on 
anything.

943
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:39,650
I have a dead.
I mean,

944
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,910
would I dished up?
And he was like,

945
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,190
holy shit,
wow,

946
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,290
you know,
I love it,

947
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,200
you know,
or a wow,

948
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,590
am I going to be in trouble here?

949
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,900
You know?
And uh,

950
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:50,743
and of course he loved the whole concept
of beIng in trouble because being in 

951
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,950
trouble meant,
uh,

952
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,730
meant that people,
that he knew,

953
00:43:58,731 --> 00:43:59,564
that he knew,
that he knew that a magazine had I had 

954
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,203
to be dynamic and how to have the ideas.
And he also understood something that 

955
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,430
people know it as the worst understands 
today.

956
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,720
And that is,
you don't write,

957
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,700
you don't write,
you don't create a magazine for your,

958
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,340
you don't do a pickup,
you don't take a poll,

959
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,091
you know,
like,

960
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,830
yeah,
like the politician don't find out what,

961
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,130
what they think and what they want.
What do you mean,

962
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:29,250
what they want?
What do you mean?

963
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,084
What they want?
They're supposed to be above and beyond 

964
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,661
that,
you know,

965
00:44:32,661 --> 00:44:33,494
uh,
the culture you're supposed to be 

966
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,590
leading the culture.
She to be ahead because he's supposed to

967
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:41,420
be telling people what the hell you 
think is exciting and dynamic and,

968
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,091
and,
and,

969
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:42,910
and,
uh,

970
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:43,450
and,
and,

971
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,790
and,
and thought provoking and,

972
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,330
and do it and do it your way.

973
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,310
And that's the way you could create a 
great margaret.

974
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,263
And then if you do it to see if you do 
it that way with all that kind of 

975
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,480
passion and a talent,
you'll get an audience.

976
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:58,540
You know,
we got all audience,

977
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,550
our patient with a at esquire 60,
the audience basically.

978
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,303
I'm not sure.
I never find out what the real numbers 

979
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,140
were,
but I think at a trauma,

980
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,590
a,
a half of the circulation.

981
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:14,430
I'm making it up a college with college 
students.

982
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,370
Yeah.
I run into people all the time.

983
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,460
I finish a day who,
uh,

984
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,423
you know,
who were in their twenties when I was 

985
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,840
doing coverage in the sixties,
you know,

986
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:26,580
and uh,
and now nowadays 60,

987
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:30,600
a 60 years old and a boy,
they know every cover they taught.

988
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,510
They can tell you how the coverage 
changed their law,

989
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,460
that changed their lives.

990
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,230
They can tell you,
they can tell.

991
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,000
The people tell me where they were when 
they show the ali cover.

992
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,640
I think sebastian,
they can tell.

993
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,070
They tell me when,
when,

994
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,980
where they were,
when they sort of cover that.

995
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,780
That's the kind of,
uh,

996
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,610
of uh,
you know,

997
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,870
and I will call them a pictorial zola's.
You know,

998
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,483
what's funny is I said toilet zola's to 
somebody a couple of months ago when 

999
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:07,370
they said what to pick zola door.
Um,

1000
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,200
you know,
wHat I explained to jack huge.

1001
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,970
They still didn't get it,
but any case,

1002
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,621
you know,
and,

1003
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:14,010
and I,
and I call myself a,

1004
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:18,600
a cultural provocateur and I call myself
a cultural product toward my advertising

1005
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:19,434
pto because when you create adverTising,
it's not just to sell a product or a 

1006
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:27,330
person or an idea it,
it should go beyond that.

1007
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,403
It should,
it cAn touch sometimes very dynamIcally 

1008
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:35,890
on the,
on the culture and it there's no way you

1009
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:37,730
can't do great advertising mess.

1010
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,753
You understand that it shouldn't,
you shouldn't just be selling a product 

1011
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,183
you shouldn't be talking about in the 
culture or where the culture should be 

1012
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:48,760
headed.
P,

1013
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,970
I talked to that,
but I took,

1014
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,833
I tell students that the young people 
and young people in advertising that 

1015
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,370
they don't know what the fuck I'm 
talking about it.

1016
00:46:56,371 --> 00:47:01,371
They don't Get it until I show examples.
You know what?

1017
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,320
So when you say what excites me most,
an appetite he was on,

1018
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:12,321
I took something and made and made it 
into a giant part of the culture.

1019
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,070
Um,
uh,

1020
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,323
and,
uh,

1021
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,090
that's,
that was the most thrilling,

1022
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:21,690
you know,
uh,

1023
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,770
of the things that I worked on and I've 
done a couple of doesn't like that.

1024
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,740
Um,
the,

1025
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,040
the,
the,

1026
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,670
the,
the esquire covers.

1027
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,510
What I was most excited about was,
um,

1028
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,670
the antiwar stuff,
you know,

1029
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,860
stuff that woke up and help walk,
wake up America and,

1030
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,270
and uh,
and uh,

1031
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:47,330
and uh,
and,

1032
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:52,330
and woke up people to the,
to the greatness of muhammad ali because

1033
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:55,240
when I did that cover of a hammer to 
leave st bastian,

1034
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,950
he was,
he was,

1035
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,170
he was.

1036
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,003
I mean,
if there was a poll on it that 80 

1037
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:03,730
percent of the country,
white and black were against him.

1038
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,013
And,
um,

1039
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,770
and the,
that cover enough of a shelf help change

1040
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,313
the american attitude about the war and 
directly directly helped change martin 

1041
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:23,180
luther king from shane to all of the 
sudden the,

1042
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,140
uh,
all,

1043
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,313
all his older black leaders that he 
would keep out of talking to or against 

1044
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,033
the Vietnam war because she didn't want 
to piss off a johnson because johnson 

1045
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,940
was a,
was a pioneer in,

1046
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,760
in helping,
uh,

1047
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,240
in,
in,

1048
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
in helping,
uh,

1049
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,960
you know,
you're fortunate,

1050
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,300
you know,
what civil rights laws,

1051
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,320
uh,
what,

1052
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,623
uh,
the check and he came out against it 

1053
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,300
defending muhammad ali and against the 
war.

1054
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,490
Uh,
he wAsn't deep shIt with the johnson.

1055
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,970
Uh,
so I mean,

1056
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,420
uh,
I think,

1057
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,653
uh,
a of a lot of things I've done that 

1058
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,470
helped change the culture,
you know,

1059
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,563
I mean,
that's the stuff that you really 

1060
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:13,564
remember.

1061
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:17,800
I mean,
uh,

1062
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,200
yeah,
I,

1063
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,620
I stayed,
I would do a magazine.

1064
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:21,454
You know what?
I probably would start an ad agency and 

1065
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,920
show everybody how much done,
you know,

1066
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,533
uh,
you know,

1067
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,310
additionally,
there was an article I read day.

1068
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,950
I,
what's funny is you're,

1069
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:36,670
you're,
you read 30 magazines,

1070
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,590
you can't remember where you read it,
you know,

1071
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:40,970
in the old days if esquire,
what?

1072
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,550
Esquire,
what am I covered?

1073
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,620
Do you remember where you show up?
But that's beside the point.

1074
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,160
Uh,
but uh,

1075
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,250
uh,
it was an article,

1076
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:54,990
got the head of the largest agency in a 
world publish ashish.

1077
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,020
I guess Joe Levy ain't go with questions
and answer.

1078
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:02,500
It goes on and on and on.
He talks about his technology.

1079
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,953
I mean,
if he had not one fucking word talking 

1080
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:10,150
about his ad age that mentioned 
creativity,

1081
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,820
it's like,
it's like a,

1082
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,650
like it's got nothing to do.

1083
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,190
The product got nothing to do with what 
they do,

1084
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,400
what they know about it.
It's shocking,

1085
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,420
you know?
Uh,

1086
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,780
that's the way it used to be with all 
the ada.

1087
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:26,770
Does she have.
I remember they would agency,

1088
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:31,771
like ogilvy made it,
you know,

1089
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,930
after david ogilvy,
he died and they,

1090
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,010
and they would,
they talked about and the jewish,

1091
00:50:38,011 --> 00:50:38,844
I,
they,

1092
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,010
they sold themselves on the fact that 
there were scientific agency and a sense

1093
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:45,470
that they did this great research,
you know,

1094
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,800
and the little,
and I told everybody,

1095
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:51,260
you know,
advertising isn't a science,

1096
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,430
it's an art.
Tell me shy.

1097
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,170
Um,
and,

1098
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,590
and,
and your most,

1099
00:50:55,591 --> 00:50:57,740
at most,
the most advertised,

1100
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,300
most people in the day,
most people in the who judge advertising

1101
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:02,760
in a,
in a,

1102
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,340
in,
in,

1103
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,340
in,
in the world,

1104
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,530
uh,
in certainly in America.

1105
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,040
They've all got their marketing schools 
and communication schools and when they,

1106
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,563
and they been taught or that advertising
and marketing is a science because how 

1107
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,800
do you teach it for the art?

1108
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,280
You know,
I mean,

1109
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,113
what would the school say for 
advertising and marketing know why I 

1110
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,080
didn't teach that,
you know?

1111
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,520
Um,
so,

1112
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:30,540
um,
so to this day,

1113
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,510
the way you show a client,
most clients or something and understand

1114
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,980
something really edgy and uh,
and they'll look at it and they'll say,

1115
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:40,814
very interesting.
I'll hand it to somebody who's sitting 

1116
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:43,454
next to him with a senior vp and say to 
a very interesting research it and find 

1117
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:49,490
out,
find out if I like it,

1118
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,990
you know,
um,

1119
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,040
you know,
there's,

1120
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,650
there's not,
there's no people that are talking about

1121
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,540
the creativity of something,
you know,

1122
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,040
uh,
uh,

1123
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,210
it's astounding in all walks of life,
you know,

1124
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:09,070
I mean starting with the head of one of 
those giant ad agencies go.

1125
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,033
But I was totally by elgar.
He made it and I remember the woman was 

1126
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:14,890
the head of the agency.

1127
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,650
She went on and on and on and on and on 
about that because the,

1128
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,330
uh,
the way they research,

1129
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:22,210
et etc cetera,
and it's about time were,

1130
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:22,771
were,
were,

1131
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:22,981
were,
were,

1132
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:24,320
were,
were not.

1133
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:26,370
One mention of creativity.
I mean,

1134
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,460
and,
and,

1135
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,740
and people like bill bird back when he 
did doyle,

1136
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,840
dane bernbach or people like me with 
papa kate,

1137
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,300

1139
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,360
that's all we talked about was 
creativity.

1140
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,810
What the fuck else is there to talk 
about?

1141
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,140
That's the name of the game,
mr.

1142
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,063
Product,
you know,

1143
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,310
it's when you,
when you talk to a guy who,

1144
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,680
uh,

1145
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,230

1146
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,430
