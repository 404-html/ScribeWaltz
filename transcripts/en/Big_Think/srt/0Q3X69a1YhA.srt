1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,880
I think I have,
if I want to,

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,790
I like to say three hours a day,
but that's,

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,683
you know,
probably in a day when I'm on my desk 

4
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:14,360
and not a,
you know,

5
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:19,361
in New York City or something,
but I think I read more than most people

6
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:24,680
in those younger than me who are so busy
doing things.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,090
So,
uh,

8
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:26,924
I have the leisure time actually to,
to read and I think that's what we've 

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,950
lost now in sort of science today is 
leisure a quick.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,950
And I had plenty of leisure because 
nothing was happening.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,830
We were trying to find the DNA 
structure,

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,100
one hundreds of new facts,
you know,

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,410
almost every week that we might learn 
about.

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,443
And uh,
so now people really defensively wanted 

15
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,510
to be sure that they're,
uh,

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,720
you know,
people will think they're experts.

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,830
So they become more and more narrow 
experts and not very broad.

18
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,190
And I still can't get over when I was at
a large pharmaceutical company.

19
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,190
They half jokingly,
but I'm sure the reality was true.

20
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,840
He had a thousand PHD technicians.
As you got your phd,

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,333
you were just a technician.
No one was hiring into a very narrow 

22
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,320
thing,
not show any,

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,110
you know,
big thoughts at all.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,060
So,
uh,

25
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,980
uh,
with so many facts,

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,620
uh,
but I missed our thinkers,

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,670
uh,
the uh,

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,370
or smart now,
don't even when I was boy,

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,660
smart people respect it.
Now it's,

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,880
you know,
people will do things who doors.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,220
And uh,
also you find that,

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,500
you know,
there hadn't been one person doing it.

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,090
There are 15 names on the paper.
And,

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,400
uh,
our famous paper for instance,

35
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,810
could have included Maurice Wilkins name
out because he was really part of a,

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,000
you didn't make the final discovery,
but he was,

37
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,660
you know,
part of this stuff just for Ford.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,520
So we asked him to put his name on the 
paper and I said,

39
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:43,450
no,
a three person pepper.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,620
Uh,
but,

41
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,240
uh,
the,

42
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:52,241
uh,
I'm worried about people really

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,400
thinking

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,520
big.
I don't find many people who do.

45
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,530
So now,
uh,

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,173
the,
uh,

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,260
when I was a student at University of 
Chicago,

48
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,513
Robert Hutchinson is free shed.
The function of the College of the 

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,730
University of Chicago is to prepare you 
for greatness.

50
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,340
He used those words because,
uh,

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,713
our educational is largely reading the 
great books and you were reading the 

52
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,050
great books,
not to,

53
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:37,051
uh,
be a teacher,

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,710
but to let you go beyond the great books
on producing another great book.

55
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,750
So that was how he saw it.
Of course,

56
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,480
he would know that,
that wouldn't happen very often,

57
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,240
but it was still there that,
uh,

58
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,010
and it certainly in dreams of people,
you know,

59
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:10,870
that they do something big was the time 
they keep it secret because,

60
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,963
you know,
it's so unrealistic and often then you 

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,440
get braggers who tell you you're doing 
something great and,

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,700
uh,
don't believe them.

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,960
But nonetheless,

64
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,410
you know,
and some sort of quiet way you should,

65
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:32,600
uh,
uh,

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,500
have big dreams.
Stop having 15 names on a paper.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,510
So,
you know,

68
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,383
I accept the fact the rest really didn't
think at all about this and you should 

69
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,660
really,
you know,

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,670
were just technicians in,
in,

71
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,690
you know,
in a real sense.

72
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,400
And uh,
uh,

73
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,430
reserve authors share for people who put
together sentences.

74
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,950
I mean,
you know,

75
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,910
you know,
the,

76
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,440
uh,
the answer,

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,310
whereas a very outset,
factories with the mother of a scientist

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:28,041
now have their second secondhand over 
paper where there are 20 other people on

79
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:35,640
the paper and she'd wonder,
is he going anywhere?

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,930
So,
uh,

81
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,620
and uh,
and another problem may be though it was

82
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,770
against everything we now say we may be 
trained to,

83
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,340
when they scientists,
that's his.

84
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:02,390
We're training people who really don't 
want to think.

85
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,420
They just want to have jobs and uh,
they consume money and uh,

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,440
so you'd lose some,
you know,

87
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:23,441
if you cut off,
people didn't have real dream.

88
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,730
But,
uh,

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,010
if you going into science,
I think,

90
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:35,290
you know,
better go in with the dream,

91
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,124
you know,
then maybe you two would get a Nobel 

92
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:38,764
prize.

93
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,960
It's not that,
you know,

94
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,813
I went in,
I thought I was very bright and I was 

95
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,670
going to get one,
but I'll confessional,

96
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,200
uh,
you know,

97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,053
I knew what it was and quick games he 
was otherwise because I saw that 

98
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,194
structure,
I thought we're going to get a Nobel 

99
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,830
prize.
You know,

100
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:05,831
that was within five minutes.
It was so obvious.
