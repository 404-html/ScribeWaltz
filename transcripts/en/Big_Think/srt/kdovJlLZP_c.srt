1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,470
No one is talking honestly about Iraq

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,010
and it's very,
very hard to say what our

3
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:23,011
responsibilities are given the unholy or
maybe it's holy mess that we have

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,580
created,
um,

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,683
in,
uh,

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,200
in Iraq
we need to shout help.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,220
We need to ask for help from the
Europeans and we need to open

8
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:43,840
negotiations with the Iranians.
We need to be talking to the Turks,

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,250
um,
but um,

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,600
and we need to be planning our own
disengagement,

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,120
but any,
any politician,

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,770
any democratic politician who claims
that we're gonna withdraw from Iraq and

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:07,771
the near future is just lying to the
American people because I'm.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,210
The Kurds don't want us to withdraw.
The Sunni chiefs don't want us to

15
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:16,900
withdraw.
The Shiite government doesn't want us to

16
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,780
withdraw the Saudis,
the Kuwaitis,

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,450
the Jordanians,
the Egyptians,

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,380
the Israelis and the Turks don't want us
to withdraw.

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,650
All of those allies of the United States
in the Middle East are very much afraid

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,040
of anything that looks like a defeat for
the United States and a withdrawal on

21
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:42,970
the schedule.
But it hasn't been proposed by Obama and

22
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:44,110
Clinton,
I suppose,

23
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,420
although they've given themselves a lot
of loopholes.

24
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,330
But withdrawal on that schedule would be
a defeat,

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,253
in fact,
it would,

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,110
it might be a route.
And um,

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,210
and so nobody is going to do that.
Um,

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,020
and how to plan a disengagement because
we,

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,920
we have to get out how to plan a
disengagement that doesn't,

30
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,260
that doesn't leave everyone that we have
worked with in the Middle East.

31
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,890
I'm crying how to do that is enormously
difficult.

32
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:18,190
And none of the candidates are talking
honestly about those difficulties.
