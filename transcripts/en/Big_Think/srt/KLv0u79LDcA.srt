1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,460
So when one country intervenes and
another country's civil war,

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,810
one of the things that happens is it
extends the war and if you think about

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,280
it,
what's happening is you're having more

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,450
resources coming into that conflict and
it's bringing in new resources,

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:22,200
bringing a new interests,
basically complicating and complexifying

6
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,110
that war that was already a very complex
war.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,600
There are ways in which intervention
might be good,

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,610
which is you're trying to pull the
parties apart,

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,250
not trying to pick sides one side,
picking the other side,

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,900
um,
and,

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,460
and that can sort of stop the killing.
But typically before that happens,

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,950
if outside states are getting involved
in a civil war,

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:44,610
it tends to extend it.
So history is mixed on how to best solve

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,240
civil wars.
Um,

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,220
it turns out that the international
community has a strong proclivity toward

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,270
a negotiated settlement.
So you want the parties to both a lay

17
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,410
down their arms and negotiate an end to
the civil war where each of them feels

18
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:01,800
as if they have a part to play in the
configuration of the new state.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,730
That is the absolute preference that the
international community has.

20
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,820
And it pushes to that we're pushing for
that today in Syria,

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,880
Afghanistan,
there's no discussion about negotiating

22
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,130
with the Taliban because we understand
we may not be able to force an,

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,750
an end to this war and that the
volleyball and are not going anywhere

24
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,120
and that we might not,
we might have to negotiate with them.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,680
The problem is in order for a negotiated
settlement to,

26
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,330
to resolve a civil war,
uh,

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,470
requires both sides to stay absolutely
committed to that and to remain

28
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:34,680
committed to that for a long time.
And that requires for both sides,

29
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:37,740
or if it was more than one side,
you can think about the former wars and

30
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:41,880
Yugoslavia more than one side.
That if they renege on the negotiated

31
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,590
settlement,
that it's going to be harmful to them

32
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,670
and to their interests.

33
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,910
So you want to be thinking about how to
ensure that both sides or all sides feel

34
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,000
compelled to stay aligned with what the
negotiated settlement brought,

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,043
uh,
in,

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,440
in order to end the war.
And one way to do that as to ensure that

37
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,590
the security service,
that the armed forces are configured

38
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,930
correctly,
and that they're representative of the

39
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,390
broader nation.
Another way is to have outside

40
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,520
peacekeepers there to keep the parties
apart.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,090
So you can think about the former
Yugoslavia or even Cyprus.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,270
There are peacekeepers there and they've
been there now for decades in both

43
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,570
places in Bosnia.
Uh,

44
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,320
they were supposed to be there for one
year.

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,020
Bill President,
Bill Clinton said we're only gonna be

46
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,690
there for a year.
And that was in 1995.

47
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,540
It's now 2017.
And similarly in Cyprus,

48
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,880
in the 19 seventies,
peacekeepers were supposed to be there

49
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,180
temporarily and they're,
they're somewhat permanently.

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,330
The good news is you haven't had many
deaths as a result because the

51
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:40,440
peacekeepers have Kevin apart.
So negotiated settlements are one way to

52
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,780
sort of end wars and to keep them w
ended.

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
But actually they're quite,
they're there,

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,640
they're not the most common.
Uh,

55
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,350
an alternative is thinking about
military victories,

56
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:53,150
which end today about half of civil wars
prior to the end of the Cold War,

57
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,600
ended three quarters of all civil wars.
So a military victory just means that

58
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,680
once I prevails on the battlefield and
it turns out historically that there are

59
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,980
more robust,
that one,

60
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,230
one side winds and prevails and civil
war,

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,890
you're more likely to have a longer
lasting settlement.

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,170
Uh,
and the question is why is that?

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,830
So I've researched that and it turns out
I believe the reason is,

64
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,170
is because to,
to reason,

65
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,410
it turns out that rebel victories or
even more a robust,

66
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,820
uh,
one is,

67
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,840
is that by defeating the other side,
you've demonstrated that you have the

68
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,760
capacity to beat the other side,
right,

69
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,470
that you actually have the military
might.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,720
So when you think about those negotiated
settlements,

71
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,200
that's what a third party is providing,
is the capacity to keep the players

72
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,910
apart.
And secondarily,

73
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,830
particularly when it comes to rebel
victories,

74
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,320
why they're more robust is they have
legitimacy.

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,680
So they defeated the government and they
usually can bring the population behind

76
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,110
them to support the configuration and
the running of the new government.

77
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,860
And in fact,
the rebels quite often bring opposition

78
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,190
into government in order to more
effectively govern.

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,360
So military victories are an option.
They have been an option historically,

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,680
the issue is the international community
sort of doesn't support it because it

81
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,030
sounds as if we're advocating the use of
force or the continued use of force.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,210
Uh,
I'm,

83
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,570
I'm a pragmatist when it comes to these
kinds of things.

84
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,950
I look at the international community,
uh,

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,060
and where it wants to go and whether it
wants to go into different corners of

86
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,820
the world and it's not willing to go
into every corner of the world,

87
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,340
the international community,
particularly large actors,

88
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:28,150
the Soviet Union in the old days,
now Russia and the United States and its

89
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,310
allies aren't going to go everywhere.

90
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,060
So they're not going to commit to
bringing peace to every corner of the

91
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,580
world.
Think about me and mark today and there

92
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,520
were hanging being targeted.
Me and Mara has had a number of civil

93
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:44,521
wars raging for a number of years,
but the international community does not

94
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:49,270
have the will to go in there and
negotiate separate pieces to bring peace

95
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,660
to that country.
And therefore we have to acknowledge and

96
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,240
recognize that military victories are
out there.

97
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,660
They have concluded civil wars most
recently.

98
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,490
Um,
they concluded two,

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,660
one was Sri Lanka where the government
prevailed over the Tamil Tigers after

100
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,880
decades of fighting.
And now,

101
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,010
yes,
it was a horrific end to that civil war.

102
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,380
There's no denying it.
There were fears of genocide,

103
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,340
but now the international community can
step in and say to the Sri Lankan

104
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:19,040
government,
you need to treat the Tamil population a

105
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,090
equitably,
fairly justly and,

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,240
and perhaps work with the Sri Lankan
government,

107
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,770
uh,
to have them behave,

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,510
to not sort of,
um,

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,440
take out vengeance a revenge against the
timing of population.

110
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,220
And then the other one is in south Sudan
with south Sudan.

111
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:38,270
It was actually a rebel victory.
Uh,

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,100
and basically that was a rebel victory
that resulted in the partition and the

113
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,140
creation of a new state.
Which again,

114
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,320
partition is quite rare.
The international community doesn't

115
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:51,760
support the idea of making new states in
part because most states in the

116
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,990
international system are multinational
and multiethnic and they don't want to

117
00:05:55,991 --> 00:06:00,991
set that precedent of allowing one state
to have in one state to allow for pieces

118
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,140
of it to break off because they fear
that it'll set off a set of dominoes,

119
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,540
not only within their own state but what
globally.

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
So,
so,

121
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,310
um,
victory is a possibility as well as

122
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,090
negotiated settlements.
Uh,

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,690
and when I look at these cases
historically,

124
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,210
and then also contemporaneously,
um,

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,030
when I'm looking at is,
is there a will and the capacity of the

126
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:24,770
international community to get involved.

127
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,590
And if there's not,
then we might want to countenance

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,410
victory for one side or the other.
Who were the good guys?

129
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,240
Who were the bad guys?
Honestly,

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,700
in most of awards is a little bit about,
on both,

131
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,550
on some cases is a lot of bad on one
side,

132
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:38,840
a little bit about,
on another.

133
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,970
Um,
and so you want to look at,

134
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,771
um,
uh,

135
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:44,840
the,
the conditions about whether victory is

136
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,240
even a possibility and then negotiate a
settlement.

137
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,630
Is there a commitment from one party,
the United Nations,

138
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:54,840
a coalition of states to go in and just
help keep the peace or to make peace and

139
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,830
then help keep the peace later?
Because without that commitment,

140
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,010
it's very hard for the parties to not be
susceptible to fighting down the road.

141
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,190
It turns out if you have one civil war,
your chances as the biggest indicator if

142
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,820
you have had a civil war in the past,
your chances of having another civil war

143
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:11,600
is much greater.
