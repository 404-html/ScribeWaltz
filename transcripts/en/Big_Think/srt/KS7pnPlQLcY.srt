1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,650
81% of white evangelicals voted for
Donald Trump in the previous election.

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,710
That's a record that's more white
evangelicals than voted for George W.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,090
Bush.
And George W.

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,090
Bush was a white evangelical.
This makes no sense to people,

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,210
especially when you consider that trump
is not just the most irreligious

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,620
president in modern history.
That his entire worldview makes a

7
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:41,621
mockery of core Christian values like
humility and empathy and care for the

8
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,330
poor,
um,

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,630
that this individual who couldn't even
name a single verse in the Bible when

10
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:54,821
asked to do so,
and yet and yet received a record number

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,700
of votes by white evangelicals,
scholars of religion,

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,900
normal rational people have been trying
to figure out why,

13
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,550
why,
what happened?

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,460
And I think that there's a couple of
things to keep in mind.

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,460
Number one,
it's white evangelicals.

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,000
81% of white evangelicals voted for
trump,

17
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:22,001
but 67% of evangelicals of color
supported Hillary Clinton.

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,650
Now,
these are people who believe the exact

19
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,070
same thing,
whose only real difference is that is

20
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:31,820
the color of their skin.
So let's not ignore the fact that there

21
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:35,240
is a racial element to this support.
Uh,

22
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,430
Jim Wallace,
the head of the sojourners,

23
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,570
a liberal evangelical group said it best
when he said that these white

24
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:45,740
evangelicals quote acted more white than
they did evangelical.

25
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,300
And I think he's right.
The second reason I think it has to do

26
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:53,120
with the,
the pernicious influence of something

27
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:57,290
called the Prosperity Gospel,
which is gripped the imaginations of

28
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:01,430
white evangelicals.
This is that a version of Christianity

29
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:05,570
preached by these charlatans like Joel
Olsteen and td Jakes,

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,160
the essential just of which is that God
wants you to drive a Bentley.

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,540
That what Jesus really wants for you is
material prosperity.

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,070
And indeed that's how you know God has
blessed you is by your material

33
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:19,970
prosperity.

34
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,230
Many white evangelicals looked at Donald
Trump,

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,370
and what they saw was a wealthy man.
And that wealth,

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,670
as far as they were concerned,
was just a sign of God's blessings.

37
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,170
And so that freed trump from having to
do what every other candidate,

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,310
certainly every other Republican
candidate for president has had to do.

39
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:43,420
And that is actually prove his spiritual
bond.

40
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,770
Bonafides.
Trump never had to do that.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,890
All he had to do was just keep talking
about how rich he was.

42
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,830
And for a large swath of white
evangelicals,

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,190
that was enough.
Thirdly,

44
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,650
Donald Trump did something that no other
president,

45
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,610
not even any Republican president
cording the event evangelical vote ever

46
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:08,530
did.
He Express Lee promised secular power to

47
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,190
these white evangelical groups in his
speeches to them.

48
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,721
And,
and,

49
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:15,910
and the conferences that he had,
both private and public,

50
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,210
he very clearly and very explicitly said
that if they voted for him,

51
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,270
that he would give them their power
back.

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,630
Um,
even if he didn't agree with their pet

53
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,540
causes,
that he would just allow them,

54
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,040
uh,
to have those causes.

55
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,230
And you can see as president,
you know,

56
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,450
he's talking now about removing for
instance,

57
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,451
than Johnson Amendment,
which is an amendment that prohibits a

58
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,420
preachers and churches from actually
engaging directly in politics,

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,050
um,
and preaching politics from the pulpit.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,510
It's why they get to keep their,
their tax break.

61
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,840
Uh,
no one has ever thought about,

62
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,350
uh,
removing this requirement until Donald

63
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,850
Trump.
And now he is very seriously,

64
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,790
uh,
moving towards allowing churches to take

65
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,640
part directly in political activism,
um,

66
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,500
as churches.
But none of this,

67
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,710
none of this explains the most important
phenomenon about white evangelicals in

68
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:24,340
America.
And that is this in the span of a single

69
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:29,320
election cycle,
white evangelicals have gone from being

70
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,590
the group in America that is most likely
to say that a politician's morality

71
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:41,581
matters to the group that is now least
likely to say that atheists and America

72
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,590
think that a politician's morality
matters more than white evangelicals in

73
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,310
America do.

74
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,990
White evangelicals who continue to refer
to themselves as value voters.

75
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,620
This is a phenomenon that can't be
explained by just looking at the

76
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,660
Prosperity Gospel or looking at racial
matters.

77
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,930
What you're seeing is a gigantic group
of Americans who are fundamentally

78
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:17,701
overturning their core theological
beliefs that public morality matters.

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,200
And the only explanation that I have for
it is that Donald Trump has turned a

80
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:30,910
large swath of white evangelical
Christianity into a cult,

81
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,410
into a religious cult,
a dangerous religious cult.

82
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,990
All the signs are there.
Um,

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,020
you know,
Donald Trump functions as he himself

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
admitted when he said offhandedly that
he could shoot someone on fifth avenue

85
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:50,980
and not lose voters.
He has become a kind of a prophetic

86
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,960
divine character.
Pat Robertson,

87
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,460
the head of the 700 club of very
influential white evangelical,

88
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,800
literally said that God took him in a
dream up to heaven.

89
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,400
And he saw Donald Trump sitting at the
right hand of God.

90
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,640
You know,
who actually sits at the right hand of

91
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:14,090
God according to Evangelicals,
Jesus Christ.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,840
In other words,
Pat Robertson is saying that Donald

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,260
Trump is essentially Jesus Christ.
That that's not that weird.

94
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,180
His Own,
uh,

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,560
evangelical advisor,
uh,

96
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,430
a pastor by the name of Jeffers,
uh,

97
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,610
said not too long ago that he would
prefer Donald Trump as a candidate over

98
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:39,161
someone who quote,
she expresses the values of Jesus.

99
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,220
So what we are seeing now is that these
white evangelicals,

100
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,970
not all of them,
but a,

101
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,030
but a fundamental core of them,
have essentially latched onto Donald

102
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,430
Donald Trump as almost a salvific
character.

103
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,650
They don't just follow him.
They don't just agree with him.

104
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,010
They almost worship him.
And my fear is that as we know from our

105
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,360
very recent history,
uh,

106
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,400
colts,
when confronted with the realities of

107
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:21,401
the world can often and in catastrophic
ways,

108
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,520
we have a presidency that is
deteriorating,

109
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,130
a president that is spiraling out of
control.

110
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,260
We have open conversations now about the
25th amendment and impeachment.

111
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,620
We have multiple investigations and the
possibility of indictments at the

112
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:44,321
highest level.
This is a presidency that is in danger

113
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,420
of completely disintegrating.
That wouldn't be such a big deal if it

114
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:55,421
weren't also a religious cult.
Because when a religious cult begins to

115
00:07:55,881 --> 00:08:00,881
deal with this kind of situation,
when they're cosmic ideas are,

116
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,590
are suddenly butting up against the
reality,

117
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,640
uh,
of,

118
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,190
of,
of a failed a leadership,

119
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,270
they tend to double down.
And that's why I think that we're in a

120
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,760
very dangerous place as a country right
now,

121
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:24,761
because the only thing more dangerous
than a cult leader like trump is a

122
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,180
martyred cult leader.

123
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,130
Mm.
