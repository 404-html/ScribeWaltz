1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,810
The global society in the landscape of
our,

2
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:05,380
of our global community is really
changing rapidly and there are trends

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:09,100
that are developing that I think it
embraced and accelerated could have a

4
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:13,270
profound positive effect on the
trajectory of our global society.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,110
And I think the open source movement and
data sharing I think is a very,

6
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:20,740
very big part of that.
It's important for organizations to have

7
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,540
all the pieces of the puzzle,
especially if these are development

8
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,540
organizations,
these are crisis response organizations.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,850
Um,
but we have not to date really had a

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,730
sufficient effective means to share
data.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,460
And I don't buy that.
I don't mean we have technical barriers

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,830
to sharing data.
We have cultural barriers to sharing

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,860
data.
Uh,

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,750
there are a lot of organizations around
the world including crisis response and

15
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,780
development and humanitarian
organizations that are reluctant to

16
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:51,781
share the real data that makes that,
that and enables true collaboration.

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,450
And I think that's a mindset we need to,
to get around.

18
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:59,410
The other thing is there's a difference
between providing data and providing

19
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:03,820
data in a usable user friendly way that
people could actually use for good.

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,900
And so there are a lot of efforts around
the world to be able to take a

21
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,090
particularly big data and to put that
into bite size bits to put that in

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,050
something that's,
that can be used by the public used by

23
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:21,670
citizen scientists used by governments
to create good.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,530
And I think there's a,
there's a strong movement in that

25
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,510
direction but we've got a long way to
go.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,300
One of the things that I think is really
going to affect our globe society is a,

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,190
and one of the things that I think is
going to propel open source and

28
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:38,191
transparency and data sharing is I
believe that true open collaboration

29
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,030
which requires all those things is going
to be a tremendous economic engine.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,540
And I think that those organizations and
those people and those governments that

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,460
deal in corruption deal and secretive
dealing,

32
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,570
those organizations that take an
exclusively proprietary mindset are

33
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:57,850
going to see themselves being left
behind and they're going to have to

34
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,700
adapt and evolve and take on a much more
collaborative and cooperative mountain

35
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,750
mindset to be able to keep up with the
economic growth.

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,100
That true open collaboration will bring.
And I think this is a really significant

37
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:09,401
trend.
You know,

38
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,160
there's many problems that we,
that we face as a global society.

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,480
No corruption,
for instance.

40
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,980
You know,
I don't think we've had corruption

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,430
probably since the first transaction,
uh,

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,420
and I don't think we're going to be able
to tackle that head on,

43
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:23,860
but we can potentially make corruption
obsolete by making it a relevant,

44
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,450
by making it,
um,

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,520
be an ineffective way to do business.

46
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:30,810
Okay.
