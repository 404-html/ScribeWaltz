1
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,790
I believe that the most important things
or the service that you provide to

2
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,060
others,
I think that,

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,590
uh,
it's very important to be objective and

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,180
clear thinking,
not to get lost in the two great dangers

5
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:29,520
that we have,
particularly in Irish society,

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,090
one of which is wishful thinking.
Uh,

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,120
we are always thinking that the world
and everything is going to be better

8
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,610
than it is.
And the other thing is hype.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,850
Oh,
Americans tend to hype everything as a

10
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,940
result of that.
We do not have a sense of proper

11
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,850
proportion and we overdo things.
I mean,

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,390
the classic example right now is the
attack on nine slash 11.

13
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,840
It was a terrible thing,
but it was only a terrorist attack.

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,890
And yet the number of people in this
country who have referred to this as the

15
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,891
beginning of world war three and use
that as an excuse for the military

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,400
adventures that were in abroad now is I
think just astonishing.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,100
Uh,
the hype in this country,

18
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:18,670
the sensationalism continually confuses
us and causes us to make enormous areas.

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,590
And my philosophy is avoid those things
at all costs.
