1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,430
I moved back to my neighborhood in the
late nineties,

2
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:14,810
after spending many years to try to
disassociate myself from it because it

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,100
was to me just the epicenter of urban
blight and you know,

4
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,900
it was dirty.
It does smell funny.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,210
There were a lot of problems associated
with it.

6
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:27,740
And I'd also buy all my formative years
were kind of watching the disinvestment

7
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,200
of the community for both the financial
sector as well,

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,180
you know,
as business sector as well.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,390
And it was a difficult place to be.
So when I got to school,

10
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:38,450
I got a chance to go away to school.
I left and I swore never to come back.

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,360
And it was only because I was so broke
that I had to move back home with my

12
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:42,890
parents.
And um,

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,790
but once I got there,
you know what got me there was the fact

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,950
that like there was this burgeoning art
community there.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,000
So that was great.
And I was like,

16
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,770
I was an artist,
so I want it to be a part of that.

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,820
But what kept me there was honestly
getting politicized,

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,790
you know,
about recognizing that my poor community

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,200
was actually being targeted,
targeted as a place that for the

20
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:04,160
repository,
you know,

21
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:08,120
for all of the bad things that you
wealthier and usually wider communities

22
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:09,310
could avoid.
Um,

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,220
I came back home to find out that our
mayor Giuliani and Pataki,

24
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,650
our governor,
we're planning on building this huge

25
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,640
waste facility on our waterfront.
Um,

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,530
that would've brought about 40% of the
city's municipal waste to the area.

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,340
Even though we were already handling
about 40% of the city's commercial

28
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,200
waste,
it was an enormous amount of waste was

29
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,160
going to be,
again,

30
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:31,010
put upon our backs.
And so they were public health issues

31
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,570
associated with that.
And I just thought,

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,790
why is this happening?

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,470
You know,
I realized it was because it was a poor

34
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,960
community and a poor community of color
to the,

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,560
and the whole idea of environmental
justice is it just just simply means

36
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,340
that no community should have to bear
the brunt of lots of environmental

37
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,860
burdens and not enjoy environmental
benefits.

38
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,480
And right now,
race and class are great indicators as

39
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,060
to where you're gonna find good stuff
like parks and trees and really bad

40
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:00,050
stuff like waste facilities.
And it just really struck me as like,

41
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:03,680
I want it to be a part of the solution
and not just,

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,510
you know,
pretended it didn't exist or just,

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,320
yeah.
