1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,210
Let me outline four different possible
explanations one can give and,

2
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,860
uh,
and I will just leave it,

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,170
leave it to the audience too,
to reflect on,

4
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:21,171
on these four possible explanations for
why we've had this extraordinary run of,

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,901
of,
of,

6
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:24,780
of bubbles and busts over the last
number of decades.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,760
A,
the first one,

8
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,610
which one might describe as sort of the,
uh,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,280
the left wing or liberal answer is that
it has,

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,640
it has basically been driven by reckless
lending,

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,290
lack of regulation and greed and that,
uh,

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,640
and that in effect,
the entire boom since,

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,930
uh,
the early Reagan years in 1982 was

14
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:47,820
basically driven by,
um,

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,043
by,
um,

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,760
by this escalating leverage that in
effect was more fake than rail.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,661
And,
uh,

18
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,440
and that,
uh,

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,410
it is basically come to an end and that,
uh,

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,690
it worked well.
It did,

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,700
but it was basically the fault of the,
uh,

22
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,760
of the lenders and all kinds of agency
problems associated with them.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,860
Um,
there's a,

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,010
there's a second type of political
events which is the right wing or

25
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,800
conservative answer,
which is that it basically was the fault

26
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,590
of the borrowers,
that they were recklessly borrowing all

27
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:19,740
this money and it was,
it was people who were too greedy and

28
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:22,800
buying houses and going on credit and
um,

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,220
and that it was sort of the product of a
narcissistic and selfish generation

30
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,514
that,
uh,

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,220
was not with short sighted and not
thinking about the future.

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,120
And under that sort of a narrative,
you might trace things back to say 19,

33
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:39,110
68 a and say that was the year that
everything went downhill in the u.

34
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,890
s and the hippies took over or
something,

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,140
something along those lines.
Now I think there's a,

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,240
it is,
of course,

37
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:49,350
the case of these two explanations are
not inconsistent and it is possible that

38
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,840
a,
there were problems with both the

39
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,180
lenders and the borrowers and that in
some sense,

40
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,310
a,
there was something about,

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,560
um,
uh,

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,530
something deeper about the whole
political system which have failed to

43
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,210
proactively deal with these things.

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,300
And just us speaking up,
speaking on my,

45
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,840
in my own context,
uh,

46
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,150
you know,
it was obvious that there was an insane

47
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:12,270
housing bubble three years ago and you
could talk about it,

48
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,480
you could scream about it,
you could go on CNBC and tell people,

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,770
uh,
there was a housing bubble,

50
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,710
they should not buy houses.
And it was like shouting into a

51
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,960
hurricane.
Nobody was willing to listen.

52
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,990
And,
uh,

53
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,020
and there is something about the,
um,

54
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,820
the nature of these things that is
extraordinarily a pro cyclical in a bad

55
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,710
way in terms of our political system
where,

56
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,480
when there is,
when there is,

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,420
when everything's going well,
the regulations get loosened,

58
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,270
when things are going badly,
they get tightened.

59
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,780
So that in effect,
the political process has had the effect

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,400
of dampening these bubbles and booms,
but actually exacerbating them

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,590
tremendously.
And I think that is going to be one of

62
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:54,360
the real serious challenges we faced in
the years ahead in the technology

63
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:54,930
context.

64
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,460
For example,
in the late nineties,

65
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:56,851
uh,
which,

66
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,684
uh,
uh,

67
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,950
you know,
there were obviously tremendous.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,540
We dealt with the abuses with Sarbanes
Oxley and there've been basically no

69
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,120
more.
I tech Ipos are virtually no tech Ipos

70
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,680
in six years.
So we had,

71
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,930
we had an excess of boom,
the regulators did nothing and then we

72
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,050
had an excess of Boston and we had an
overreaction and uh,

73
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,800
and again you can blame it on special
interest groups that are serving the

74
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,030
lenders.
You can blame it on,

75
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,100
on,
on the desire of the borrowers to keep

76
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,780
the easy money going,
but when basically a,

77
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,310
both of them and you have to wonder how,
how this,

78
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,160
how this can better be handled.
I think one of the challenges,

79
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:36,994
the,
uh,

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,530
that is happening on a global scale is
that the inability of our political

81
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:46,531
system to proactively deal with these
bubbles is calling into question the

82
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,360
very concept of democratic capitalism.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,090
And I think one of the,
one of the challenges in the next,

84
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:55,300
uh,
next four to five years is that as sort

85
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,610
of a more authoritarian version of
capitalism,

86
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,600
of the sort that one sees in China will
get a lot more appeal.

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,450
Because the argument will be that it is
able to,

88
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,890
uh,
to resist the,

89
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:06,820
uh,
the appeal of,

90
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,880
of,
of people and special interests groups,

91
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,830
uh,
and sort of act on behalf of the whole

92
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,170
society.
And I think the challenge for the next

93
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,500
president is going to be to somehow,
um,

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,810
rehabilitate the good name of democratic
capitalism.

95
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:20,231
And,
uh,

96
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,090
it will be,
it'll be quite a big challenge.

97
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,780
And I certainly hope that whoever
becomes president will succeed at that.

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,771
Let me,
let me,

99
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,060
however,
outline a fourth,

100
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,900
a possible explanation for why so many
of these bubbles have turned into bus.

101
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:35,050
And this is probably my own,
my own personal hobby.

102
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,500
Hoarseness,
which is that there's not been enough

103
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,770
real growth in the economy and that in
some sense,

104
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,110
the reason so many of these booms didn't
work was that the whole economy was not

105
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,990
growing.
And this is not a question about finance

106
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:53,410
or politics or regulation or at least
not centrally about those,

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,970
but about science and technology and the
rate at which science and technology are

108
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,500
progressing.
And,

109
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,700
uh,
and I think sort of one,

110
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,680
and you know,
while there's incredible hype

111
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,070
surrounding tech companies and
scientific innovation,

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,690
the reality has simply not lived up to
the hype for a very long time.

113
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:11,230
And,
uh,

114
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,990
and the,
the,

115
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,990
you know,
the anecdote I would cite as if we were

116
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,140
sitting in this room in 1968 and talking
about what was the future of the US

117
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,910
going to look like in 40 years.
Uh,

118
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,310
you know,
we would have predicted the cation trips

119
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,144
to the moon.

120
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,770
I'm a space spaceships on Mars,
um,

121
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,960
massive increases in productivity.
Zerbe on triber,

122
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,200
a European writer wrote the American
challenge in 1967.

123
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,460
He said that by the year 2000,
the average person,

124
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,240
the US will be working seven hours a
day,

125
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,630
four days a week and have 13 weeks,
a year of paid vacation time.

126
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,590
Which,
uh,

127
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,670
which was a reflection of the incredible
growth in productivity that was set to

128
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,540
take place by accelerating technology
and science and I,

129
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,130
and it's gone.
Everything's gone the other way.

130
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,100
There's not been enough progress.
And I think,

131
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,790
I think the longterm challenge that I
would submit is that we somehow need to,

132
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,950
to get that restarted.
And it is very,

133
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,670
it's not easy.
Um,

134
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,610
it's,
it's,

135
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,440
it's broken down for a lot of very
complicated reasons,

136
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,840
but I think that,
that in some sense,

137
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,420
um,
that's the kind of thing that,

138
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,150
that needs to be very much restarted.

139
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,720
If I had a last thought on this is if
one had to look at the whole series of

140
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,360
bubbles,
the one that I think was the central

141
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,340
one,
perhaps not just in time,

142
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:30,290
but also in importance was the tech
bubble of the late nineties.

143
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,260
And in some sense when that one turned
out to go wrong,

144
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,100
it meant that none of them would work
because if there was not going to be

145
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,910
exponential progress in technology,
nothing else made sense and you could

146
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,790
leverage up in housing.
But eventually housing prices would go

147
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,450
down if there was no real growth in the
society taking place.

148
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,830
And the same.
I think it's true of a finance and to a

149
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,920
lesser extent of the,
uh,

150
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:55,160
the emerging market of the emerging
market story.

151
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,820
So I think the,
I would encourage us to very seriously

152
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:02,450
rethink why there's been so little
progress and how that can be

153
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,790
accelerated.
I think this is certainly one of the
