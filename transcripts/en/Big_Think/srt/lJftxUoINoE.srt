1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,010
So my name is Dan Arielli and I'm the
James B Duke professor of psychology and

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:10,011
behavioral economics at Duke University.
So I became interested in online dating

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:14,850
because one of the people who were
sitting in an office next to me was

4
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:17,700
incredibly miserable and he was an
assistant professor.

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,700
He just moved to the university where I
was at a.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,090
He was spending long hours.
He was not finding anybody to date.

7
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,140
He was couldn't date students at the
university who was a professor and he

8
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,670
didn't have time to go outside,
you know,

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:31,530
we will not particularly social bunch,
you know,

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,230
he was,
he was basically stuck and all I did it

11
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:39,180
was a very promising way to think about
this solution for a marketplace that

12
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,960
wasn't working very well and he tried
online dating and he was just failing

13
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:45,990
miserably continuously.
So that kind of piqued my curiosity

14
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,824
about it.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,020
And then I started looking at online
dating.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,100
So I started looking by registering
myself and looking at other people.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,030
And then I said,
let,

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,140
let me ask some of my friends to enroll
because I didn't ask them to really

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,360
enroll.
They just took the profile sheets and

20
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,520
they ask people,
could you fill those out but without

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,280
your name,
and they took people that I liked more

22
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,970
than I liked less and they took a profit
and I tried to figure out who they tell

23
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,230
the difference.
You know,

24
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,410
and imagine that you did this.
Imagine you went to 50 people you really

25
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,420
like and 50 people you only like so,
so,

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,910
and you asked all of them to feel this
profit.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,760
Then you took this 100 profiles and you
try to sort them into piles.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,330
It turns out we were terrible at this,
right?

29
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:27,900
So this is kind of an initial
observation is that something is going

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,090
wrong in this,
in this market,

31
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,720
and then went a step further,
did some studies with online data is

32
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:37,980
about how much they enjoyed it and what
they were getting from it until the

33
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:38,940
final stage we.

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,490
I figured out,
I thought I knew what was going on,

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,910
which is that online dating site assume
that people are easy to describe on

36
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,800
searchable attributes.
They think that we're like digital

37
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,910
cameras that you can describe somebody
by their height and weight and political

38
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,850
affiliation and so on,
but it turns out people are much more

39
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,790
like wine that when you taste the wine,
you could describe it,

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,480
but he's not a very useful description,
but you know if you like it or don't,

41
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,280
is the complexity and the completeness
of the experience that tells you if

42
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,960
you're like a person or not.
And these breaking into attributes turns

43
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,240
out not to be very informative.
So in the last stage of this process,

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,170
we created a different website and that
different websites allow people to

45
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:23,370
experience other people without all of
these attributes and we show that this

46
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,250
is actually much better and would lead
to much more,

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,170
much higher probability of going on a
second on the real date afterwards.

48
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,910
So.
So it kind of goes from an observation

49
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,900
to a little study to a bit more details
and finally proposing some kind of

50
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,450
solution of something that I think would
actually work better.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,230
So the site basically looks at real
dates and think about what real dates

52
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,190
are.
They're not about sitting in a room and

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,030
interviewing each other about question.
They're often about experiencing.

54
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:54,690
It's in something together in the real
world and I think it's because if you

55
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:59,260
and I went out and we went somewhere,
I would look at how you react to the

56
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,360
outside world,
what music you like,

57
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,310
what you don't like,
what kind of pictures you like,

58
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,410
what kind of images,
how do you react to other people,

59
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:10,360
what do you do in the restaurant and
through all these kinds of non explicit

60
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,010
aspects,
I will learn something about,

61
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,660
you know,
I would feel that I'm learning something

62
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,470
about you and the online system we
created was very much like that.

63
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,850
It was about you came up when you got
the little Avatar is square or triangle,

64
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,851
some color and you wanting to a virtual
space which you could explore it and you

65
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,180
could see lots of stuff.
There were pictures and images and there

66
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,050
were words and there were movies and
they were bands.

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,300
There's all kinds of stuff and you could
go and when you came to another little

68
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,610
Avatar,
you could start chatting and you would

69
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,430
chat about something.
It wasn't about interviewing when you

70
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,970
went to school in what's your religion?
It was about talking about something

71
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,300
else and it turns out it gave people
much more information about each other

72
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,870
and they're much more likely to want to
meet each other for the first eight and

73
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,210
four for a second date.

74
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,030
So I think that online dating is an
incredibly unsatisfying experience.

75
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,090
In fact,
when we do surveys to understand what

76
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,480
people do,
they the basic trade off is for each six

77
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:11,650
hours of searching for people and
emailing them and you get one cup of

78
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,890
coffee and it's not as if people enjoy
online dating.

79
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:19,210
It's not as if they have fun searching
people in a writing blogs for them.

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,630
I mean imagine that you basically had to
drive six hours,

81
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,090
three hours each week to have coffee
with somebody and you know,

82
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,810
coffee usually ends up with just coffee.
It's an incredibly unsatisfying

83
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,010
experience.
So I,

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,950
I think it's a really bad.
It's really bad system.

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,650
On top of that,
there's another thing is,

86
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,450
which I imagine they gave you the search
criteria which asks you to search by

87
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:43,000
height and weight and income and all of
those things.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,190
You're going to use it.
That's what I give you to search.

89
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,200
You're going to use it.
There's a million people out there.

90
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,380
You want to limit them to $3,000.
That's what we're going to.

91
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,690
That's what you're going to use,
and because of that,

92
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,940
I think actually people become much more
superficial than we think they're.

93
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,800
So here's an example.
It turns out that women really care

94
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,410
about men's height.
I'm five nine.

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,340
If I wanted to be as attractive as
somebody who's five,

96
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,970
10,
right?

97
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:10,150
Another inch,
I would have to make about 35,

98
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,690
$40,000 more a year.
That's another money for one inch.

99
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,590
At the same time,
it turns out that men care a lot about

100
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,030
women's BMS.
In fact,

101
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,000
they want women to be slightly on the
rack sick.

102
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:24,010
It's like 18 and a half and you look at
women's attractiveness.

103
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:27,520
It goes really up at low BMI and really
drops below that.

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,880
Now people online look incredibly
superficial,

105
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,660
they look at hair color and they look at
height and they look at income and

106
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:37,480
that's basically it and attractiveness
of course,

107
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,620
and you can ask is it because that's all
people care about or is that because

108
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:45,490
that's what the system is giving them to
search for and I think it's because of

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,780
combination,
right?

110
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,770
Sure.
We also prefer,

111
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:51,070
sure we do care about attractiveness and
in heightened income,

112
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,960
and these are,
these are features for us,

113
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:56,380
but they think they're exaggerated by
the way the system is creative.

114
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,820
Imagine you were looking for something
else.

115
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,710
Imagine you were looking for eh digital
cameras and imagine that I only allow

116
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:08,480
you to search on mega pixels and the f
stop for the Lens,

117
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,460
right?
These things will become incredibly

118
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,780
important.
Right?

119
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,820
And if I drop some things from the
search,

120
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,640
they will become as if they're not
important or much less important.

121
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,030
So I think part of the problem is that
the systems don't give us the right

122
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,340
information that we need and because of
this,

123
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,910
I think the experience of online dating
is generally unsatisfying.

124
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,803
I mean,
think about it,

125
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,910
how many millions of people are
participating in this activity and a

126
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,110
marriage rates has not increased.
Divorce rate has decreased.

127
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,720
I mean,
not really much has happened because of

128
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,010
the Atlantic.
At the same time.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,950
I think it's incredibly important,
right?

130
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:48,830
We,
the dating market is perhaps the only

131
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,980
market that we moved from a centralized
market to a decentralized markets.

132
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,640
You know,
we used to have a into your parents used

133
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,320
to tell you what to do.
All this is gone.

134
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,750
Now you have to fend for yourself.
On top of that,

135
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,910
we move a lot,
right?

136
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,410
You,
you go to one place for Undergrad,

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,410
then you go to Grad school,
then you move to another city for a job

138
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,160
to easily remove.

139
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,410
Again,
you have no time to create a social

140
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,360
network.
We work long hours,

141
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,690
so it really assist them where we don't
have time to find people for ourselves.

142
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,130
It's very,
it's taboo to date people at the

143
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,470
workplace.
Uh,

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,530
the social networks are weaker in the
physical world.

145
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,630
We move all the time and we don't have
a,

146
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,370
our parents to tell us what to do.
So,

147
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,670
so online dating are incredibly
important.

148
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:35,300
They could be central and crucial and we
need to create them because it's really

149
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,570
a miserable situation for most single
people at the same time.

150
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,790
The ones that we have created and they
all look the same.

151
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,920
Basically,
there are no real differences between

152
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,300
them.
The ones that we're creating,

153
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,350
I just not that useful.

154
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,240
Assortative mating is the idea that if
you took all men and you rank them on

155
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,590
how attractive they are from the most
attractive to the least attractive and

156
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,960
you write it all women from the most
attractive to the least attractive and

157
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,670
you can think about attractiveness is
built,

158
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,230
being built from lots of stuff,
right?

159
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:06,380
It's not just beauty.
It could be beauty and intelligence and

160
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,750
so on,
but if you created this,

161
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,950
it was mostly about beauty,
but you know,

162
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,730
if you created that,
it turns out that the most attractive

163
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,320
would date,
the most attractive,

164
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,860
the middle attractive with basically the
middle and the low data low.

165
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,490
Now there could be slight deviations,
but that's what happened and why?

166
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,710
Because if you're at the top and you're
a guy,

167
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:27,440
you can pick anybody you want,
so you would pick a woman who was on the

168
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,170
top and if she's at the top she could
pick anybody she wants you will pick

169
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:30,820
you.

170
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,960
So another question is what happened to
the people in the middle,

171
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,971
you know,
most of us,

172
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,620
what,
what happens to people in the middle,

173
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:39,470
how do we make sense of where we are in
the social hierarchy?

174
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,240
And for me that thought actually became
a very kind of crucial in the parents

175
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,430
when I got injured.
So here's what happened.

176
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,650
You,
you grow up and you have some kind of

177
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,470
space in society and you know,
basically where you are and you know,

178
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:55,760
who date you and who would not take you,
who's kind of outside of your league in

179
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,610
general terms and you know,
where you fit in the social hierarchy.

180
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,000
And,
and,

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,280
and I knew I wasn't a social hierarchy,
but one day I got badly injured and you

182
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:06,840
know,
I couldn't think about romantic stuff

183
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:09,000
for a long time.
But when I could,

184
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
um,
office and I started wondering about

185
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:14,550
where do I fall now in the social
hierarchy,

186
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,490
I'll try to think about,
do I fall in the same place?

187
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm kind of the same person inside,
but I look much less attractive.

188
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,800
Right.
And with the women who were dating

189
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,860
before we keep on dating me now.
And I said,

190
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,390
why would they,
they have other options,

191
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,920
right?
I'm not the only guy in the world.

192
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,920
So,
so it was kind of a very difficult

193
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,460
concept for me to think about where do I
fall?

194
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,140
I felt differently on the social
hierarchy.

195
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,710
I basically lost my space all of the
time and I was trying to understand how

196
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:43,530
these social dance happened and how we
find our place.

197
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,490
And I was really wondering about where
would I find my own mate,

198
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,990
where,
where would I fit in this in this scale?

199
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,470
And there's a lot of personal
complexities with it,

200
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,940
but eventually it led me to a study in
the study was really asking the question

201
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:02,941
of how do we make sense of where we fit
in the hierarchy and the basically kind

202
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,790
of multiple explanations,
right?

203
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,910
You could say you never adjust.
You never.

204
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:13,260
If you kind of in the middle range or
the low range and you only are.

205
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,960
You have to date somebody else who's in
the middle range.

206
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,250
You never make peace with it.
You wake up every morning,

207
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,050
you look at your partner across your
shoulder and you say,

208
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:23,130
well,
that's the best I could.

209
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,010
I really wanted more.
Sadly,

210
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,260
no.
I have to admit my limitations.

211
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,840
That's the most I could do.
That means you don't adapt.

212
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,070
It could be that you adapt.
It could be that,

213
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,940
for example,
if you're unattractive,

214
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,570
you start looking at other features that
are unattractive and see them as

215
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,350
attractive.
You remember the story from cree love

216
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,800
when you have this,
this wolf city say grapes over the fence

217
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:49,530
and he tries to get them and he can't
get them and eventually said,

218
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,180
ah,
there was sour anyway,

219
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,740
and he goes to eat something else.

220
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,800
Right?
So you could imagine that if you are

221
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,630
attractive yourself,
you start valuing.

222
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,340
If you're a woman,
you start valuing short men who are bald

223
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:03,570
with bad teeth,
right?

224
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,700
I mean you just say,
these are really wonderful features.

225
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:08,150
I like hairy chest.
I like bullheaded.

226
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,780
You basically change what you like and
that actually helps you adjust.

227
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,380
Or You can imagine that you start liking
other things.

228
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,080
You stop paying attention to
attractiveness and start paying

229
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:22,230
attention to other things.
So we tried that in an experiment.

230
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,440
Initially we went to this website called
hot or not.

231
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,500
It's a wonderful website.
You see pictures of people and you

232
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:32,670
decide you rank them on a scale from
zero to 10 about how attractive they are

233
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,860
and then you see how you rated this
person,

234
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,430
how other people rate them.
But the nice feature about this website

235
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,431
is that if I reach people,
the website knows how I was rated as

236
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:45,690
well because I have my picture there as
well.

237
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,980
By the way,
I'm not rated very high,

238
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:51,210
I think like six point four.
But there are people who are rating,

239
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,030
you know how the rating and you know how
the rated.

240
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,780
So now the question is the people who
are providing the rating,

241
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,500
there are people who are really
attractive,

242
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,960
that are providing writing and people
who are really unattractive,

243
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,870
providing the rating.
And the first thing you can ask is do

244
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,320
they have different ratings?
Are the people who are inherently

245
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,500
unattractive?
Do they see beauty differently?

246
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,160
And the answer is no.
We all see beauty in the same way.

247
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,140
The people who are nine rate people the
same way as the people who are for in

248
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,270
the hotness rating.
So,

249
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,490
so people don't change their sense of
beauty.

250
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:25,830
Now you could say,
uh,

251
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,650
so maybe they don't adjust at all.
Maybe they don't adapt the people who

252
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:34,651
are for coupons looking for the people
who are with nine or maybe they adapt

253
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,584
some other way.

254
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,450
So hot the note has another feature
which is the cycle of meet me in which

255
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:43,240
you see pictures of people and you say,
do I want to meet them or not?

256
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,510
Now it's not just reading.
It's about also thinking about the

257
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:51,511
probability that you will be accepted or
turn down and it's not so embarrassing

258
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,760
to be turned online,
but it's still a little bit

259
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,890
embarrassing.
So the question is that people who are

260
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,990
nine,
will they approach different people than

261
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,870
the people who are for.
And the answer is absolutely yes.

262
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,050
The people who are for basically
approached people who are four or five,

263
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,080
the people who are nine approach people
who are nine or 10 people are a little

264
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,090
optimistic.
They approach a little too high,

265
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,170
but they basically know the rage.
So what happened is people know the

266
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,820
range,
they know where they are in the social

267
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,330
hierarchy,
but the same time they see beauty at the

268
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:19,840
same thing.

269
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,600
So what happens?
So how people solve it,

270
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,540
they wake up every morning feeling bad
or do they solve it in some way?

271
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,950
So the last step we did the speed dating
events.

272
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,120
We get people to do a speed dating event
and we asked them to rate other people

273
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,630
or lots of attributes,
not just attractiveness,

274
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:38,290
but all kinds of other things and what
we saw was the people who are very

275
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,340
attractive,
cared more about attractiveness.

276
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,680
This is like one of the dominating
criteria.

277
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,570
They want to date somebody who is
attractive.

278
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,710
While the people who are unattractive
basically say we don't care so much

279
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,860
about attractiveness.
We want people who are kind and have a

280
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,100
good sense of humor.
So what happened is that the way people

281
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:02,101
adapt the people at the low end of the
scale is by changing your priorities and

282
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,880
office and saying,
I want people with different set of

283
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,140
attributes I don't care so much about,
but I want somebody who's client good

284
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,380
hearted with a good sense of humor.
And that's actually the story for the

285
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:17,200
patients.
So that's the story of how we are coming

286
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:21,760
into a social hierarchy in a certain
place and based on our circumstances

287
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,750
come to understand differently what we
want and don't want and how we view the

288
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:29,470
world in a way that is compatible with
where we are in the social hierarchy.

289
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,740
So I don't know if you've had the
experience of going into a Kia,

290
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,650
but uh,
I,

291
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,330
I go from time to time and the last
thing I did was a builder,

292
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,810
a toy chest for my,
for my kids.

293
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:45,811
And when I got home with this box
actually set up boxes and they started

294
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,170
assembling them.
Uh,

295
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,660
for me,
the instructions were very unclear and I

296
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,880
kept on screwing things and screwing
them wrongly and had to disassemble it,

297
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,260
put it back together.
And so on.

298
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,140
By the end of the day,
I worked a lot.

299
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:59,360
It was not a particularly beautiful
piece of furniture,

300
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,250
but I was actually quite attached to it.
What did.

301
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,600
I think that's kind of the interesting
idea is that when you put a lot of

302
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,860
yourself into it,
some sweat and energy and anger,

303
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,730
not even frustration,
you end up loving the end product a bit

304
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:14,564
more.

305
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,050
We tried to do this with experiments and
we got people to build the Legos in and

306
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,480
all kinds of things and the first thing
we found was that if there was an

307
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,210
origami that you build in Origami that
somebody else built,

308
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,490
you think that yours is much,
much more beautiful.

309
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,580
Not only is it more beautiful,
you willing to pay much more for it.

310
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,000
Right now.
The question is why you could imagine I

311
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:39,110
built an origami that is uniquely good
for me and you the other origami is not

312
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,950
so it's unique to me.
It's not about the fact that I kind of

313
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,500
wrongly evaluated.
He just has some features that are

314
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:49,280
particularly like.
So we ask people to predict how other

315
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,430
people would pay for it and it turns out
people are really wrong with it.

316
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,070
Not only do we like more the origami we
make,

317
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:57,470
we think other people would love them as
well.

318
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,940
And you can think about kids like this,
right?

319
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,530
I have two wonderful kids.
I love them dearly.

320
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:07,400
I think they're amazing when we go to a
party and they dance or do something.

321
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,390
I can't believe that any of the parents
would want to do anything but look at my

322
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,500
kids.
Right?

323
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,390
And that's the issue right there.
My kids,

324
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,000
I think they're are wonderful,
but not only that,

325
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:20,890
I think that other people should see
them as wonderful as I see them in the

326
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,150
same thing happened with origami or with
everything we make.

327
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,710
Not only do we overvalue it,
we think that everybody will share our,

328
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,500
our perspective.
And

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,560
this of course creates both
opportunities for better things and

330
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,630
opportunities for mistakes.
Right?

331
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,000
So if you're,
if you're a company and you can create

332
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,150
things that people would actually put
something of themselves into it and

333
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,940
actually value it more,
that's a great thing to do,

334
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,830
right?

335
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,460
Uh,
there's lots of opportunities for

336
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:54,020
tailoring and custom made and use a
design on the web.

337
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,030
It's also about cooking for yourself and
doing your own garden and fixing things

338
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,570
yourself because we might not understand
that if we do something ourselves,

339
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:06,680
we would like it more,
but the fact is we we likely would do

340
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,760
the same thing,
but of course there's the downside and

341
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,350
the downside is if we create something,
we ended up loving it,

342
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,290
perhaps too much.
We don't sit it in an objective way and

343
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,690
as a consequence we can make mistakes as
well.

344
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:21,080
And that's actually a general comment
about rationality and irrationality.

345
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,560
Rationality and irrationality is not
always bad.

346
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:27,980
It's not always that the irrational
person is better than irrational.

347
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,220
It's a mixture,
right?

348
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,560
It's really wonderful that we can love
our kids so much that that's why they

349
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:36,470
actually get to live and we care about
them,

350
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,840
but at the same time,
our blindness to them,

351
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,950
to them or to the weaknesses can
actually create some negative

352
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:44,000
consequences as well.

353
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,070
So I think the world would actually be
quite terrible if everybody would be,

354
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
would be perfectly rational.
And you know,

355
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,520
when you ask people this question
initially,

356
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:53,941
you said,
Oh yes,

357
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,330
I want everybody to be irrational,
but the fact is that I pick the title,

358
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,760
the upside of irrationality,
because I think there's a lot of

359
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,790
wonderful things about your rationality.
I'll give you two examples.

360
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,280
The first one is imagine that you left
your wallet on your desk and you went

361
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:11,640
out for lunch.
What are the odds that somebody will

362
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:14,910
steal it right?
And now think about what are the odds

363
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,460
that somebody would steal it if
everybody you worked with was perfectly

364
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,980
rational.
If everybody was constantly doing the

365
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,280
cost benefit analysis,
if that's all what people were doing,

366
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,840
they would pass by your desk.
They would say,

367
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:25,680
hey,
nobody's here.

368
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:28,980
Nobody's looking.
I can steal this and have no chance of

369
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:29,730
being caught.

370
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,160
Let me do that.
Right?

371
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,960
In fact,
if we lived in a society where everybody

372
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:37,200
was just maximizing their own self
interest all the time,

373
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,360
it will be quite a terrible place to
live.

374
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,860
Here's another example.
Imagine a game we call the trust game

375
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,030
and then I'll tell you about the trust
game.

376
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:46,980
We'd revenge.
So imagine two players,

377
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:50,040
player a and player B,
and the trust game looks like this.

378
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,560
We tell player a player,
you have $20,

379
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,100
you could do two things,
you can either go home or you can give

380
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,220
your money to player b and you don't
know who play B is and you'll ever meet

381
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,470
them.
If you send your money to play or a B

382
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:04,550
player b will get $80,
the money will quadruple magically

383
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,230
underway.
And now play a beat who decide to do two

384
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,060
things?
They could go home with $80,

385
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,360
in which case you will get nothing or
they could send you back half the money.

386
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Now think about this situation.
Imagine you player a and you ask

387
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:20,460
yourself what would play or be do if
player b was perfectly rational,

388
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,250
what would they do?
They will go home with all the money,

389
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,290
right?
They will maximize the self interest.

390
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,340
Why would they give you back any money?
So if you thought that player b was

391
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,290
perfectly rational,
would you send them the money?

392
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,060
Of course not,
right?

393
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:36,750
So the rational prediction is that
player b will never send the money back,

394
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,420
and because of that,
player a will never trust him to start

395
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,640
with.
Turns out people are much nicer than

396
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:44,290
economic theory predicts.
There's a good chance that player a,

397
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,920
we'll send them money and a good chess
player.

398
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,880
B,
we'll send half the money back.

399
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,430
And if you were a player b,
you can just imagine.

400
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:51,870
Imagine you just got in the mail.

401
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,010
Somebody that says,
Hey,

402
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,950
here's what happened.
Would you send the money back or not?

403
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,270
Right?
Most people would do it.

404
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,790
So people,
this is the case when people are

405
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,020
national economic theory,
but imagine your player a and you send

406
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:08,180
them money to player B and player b took
the money and left and now I come to you

407
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,821
and I say,
really?

408
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,280
Salary player a,
you lost all your money.

409
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:14,910
But I tell you what,
if you go into a checking account and

410
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:19,911
you get more money out and you give it
to me for every dollar you give me,

411
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,650
I will go.
I will hunt,

412
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,270
play a beat down and I'll take $2 away
from them.

413
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,720
You give me $2,
a 109,

414
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,460
take four,
you gave me 10 $100 and take from them

415
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,140
and the question is would you lose more
of your own money to exert revenge on

416
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,384
them?

417
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,770
You just lost $20 and you can lose even
more to exact revenge on them.

418
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,670
And everybody who had a divorce or
breakup know the answer right?

419
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,490
When we feel betrayed,
we would spend lots and lots of money to

420
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:51,400
inflict even more pain on the other
side.

421
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,540
And when Ernst Fair in some of his
friends did it work like this,

422
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,530
they basically put people in an imaging
so they could image people's brains

423
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:03,540
while they were executing and plotting
revenge and what they saw was that the

424
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,780
activity of revenge was rewarding.
It was pleasurable.

425
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,360
Now again,
it's irrational.

426
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,340
Why would it be rewarding and
pleasurable?

427
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,480
Think about it this way.
Imagine that you and I were living on a

428
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,100
desert island and imagined I had the
mango and you wanted my mango and

429
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:23,950
imagine I kind of looked.
I was away for a minute and you could

430
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:28,360
still my mango if you thought that the
only thing I was doing is a cost benefit

431
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:29,050
analysis.

432
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,883
You would say,
Hey,

433
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,590
if I steal Dan's mango and run far away
enough,

434
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,070
he will do the cost benefit analysis.
You will decide not to chase me,

435
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:39,340
not to find out what happened.
He'll just go and get the new mango and

436
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,070
under those circumstances a good chance
you'll take my mango away,

437
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,320
but what if I was a revengeful type?
What if you knew that if you stole my

438
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,750
mango,
I will not sleep and I will not rest.

439
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,560
I will hunt you down.
It doesn't matter how long it will take

440
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:57,370
me and how far I have to run and how
many nights I will not sleep.

441
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,550
I will hunt you down.
I'll take my mango and all your bananas

442
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:04,210
in your goat and your whatever,
whatever it is under that condition,

443
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:05,980
you will probably not start with me to
start with.

444
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,480
Right?
You will not take anything with me.

445
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,400
So the way to understand it is that
trusting is irrational,

446
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,760
but we do it.
Revenge is irrational,

447
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,990
but we do it and we do it because trust
and revenge are actually two sides of

448
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,590
the same coin.
Trust is incredibly important for

449
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,740
society.
Imagine how we would live in a society

450
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:28,990
without trust,
but to have trust,

451
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:33,070
we also have to have revenge and those
things together make sense.

452
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,520
They're both irrational,
but they're both make sense and they

453
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,370
actually help us to live in a better
society.

454
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,690
So would I prefer a society when
everybody's rational?

455
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,100
I don't think so.
Not In a.

456
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,293
not in a long shot.

457
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,590
One of the things that I think companies
do to a large degree that makes very

458
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:58,591
little sense is the use of focus groups.
So think about what a strange idea is

459
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:03,751
that we take 10 people who know
basically nothing about your project and

460
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,030
you put them in a room and you let them
talk for awhile and then you take the

461
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:10,630
whatever they came up with as a
consequence of these two hours of random

462
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,650
thinking and you base your strategy on
it to a large degree.

463
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,480
And,
and I don't want to say that focus

464
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:19,030
groups are always useless and also
uninformative,

465
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,350
but I think that taking this data and
then realizing it as extensively as

466
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,310
companies do,
I think,

467
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,140
I think it's crazy in many ways.
And the reason I think companies do it

468
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,310
is because when these people create a
sentence or an idea,

469
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:38,311
it's very easy to say,
joe focus group 17 said this and it can

470
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,520
help you create a form,
formulate an idea around it.

471
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,120
When if you said 87 percent of the
people said x,

472
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,700
he just doesn't have a face,
he doesn't have a desire,

473
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:53,960
it's just not as concrete and therefore
people are not as excited about the,

474
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,200
about the notion.
So I think the focus group is incredibly

475
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:00,390
useful as a persuasive attempt,
uh,

476
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,850
to,
to tell people what to do,

477
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:06,740
but as a way to find out information,
it's not as useful as people think it

478
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,740
is.
The other thing that really puzzles me

479
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,450
is that the companies,
how little they understand about how

480
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,740
incentives really work.
So the,

481
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,120
the biggest expenditure for almost any
company is salaries.

482
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,970
And you ask people,
what do you know about the relationship

483
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:26,180
between salaries and performance?
The answer is nothing.

484
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,330
Right?
And the question is why don't they study

485
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,050
anything?
Why don't they studied?

486
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:32,660
Why don't they try different
performance,

487
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,470
different incentive level and see how it
influenced a performance.

488
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,470
And they often say,
well the law kind of laws and if we have

489
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,510
pay some people one way and another way
we might be sued.

490
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,820
And,
but in the last two years with all these

491
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,850
questions about bonuses and so on,
I've gone to many companies and said,

492
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,350
why don't we at least do some surveys?
Why don't we at least see how happy

493
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,900
people are on the months where they give
them,

494
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,120
you give them their bonus and how
productive they are.

495
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,290
And the answer I got 100 percent of the
time is that people are really miserable

496
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,720
in both the season.
And because of that they don't want to

497
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,180
ask them any more questions.
And I said,

498
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,510
if people are miserable in bonuses and
shouldn't it mean that you should study

499
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,730
it,
understand it and try to prevent it from

500
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:15,200
next for next year.
And say,

501
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,460
well,
well not this year,

502
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,960
this year was really miserable.

503
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,570
Maybe next year come back to us next
year.

504
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,610
But if you think about it,
it's really incredible.

505
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,610
Now how do companies decide about
compensation?

506
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,840
They look at what other companies are
doing and try to equate compensation to

507
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:33,080
what other companies are doing it,
but it's a place of the blind leading

508
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,010
the blind.
Right?

509
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:36,560
And then if we pay five percent more,
other people will start doing it,

510
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,900
but the real question is how do you pay
in?

511
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:42,680
How do you get people to care about
their work and become more productive

512
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,720
and be happier at their work?
And the answer is not simply that more

513
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,660
money is better,
more money can be part of the equation,

514
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,790
but it's also the question of how do you
give that money?

515
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,940
You give it a bonus to give this a fixed
salary.

516
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,770
You give it as a part of the benefits.
Maybe you give benefits for the gym.

517
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:02,840
Do you send people on vacation to the
Bahamas?

518
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,880
And it turns out that there are ways to
use money that is economically less

519
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,400
efficient,
but actually get people to be more

520
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,720
motivated,
care more,

521
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,160
and actually become more productive.

522
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,730
So this is a you can think of is the
Baby Jessica Fair trade.

523
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:23,080
When Baby Jessica fell to the well and
she really suffered and her parents must

524
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,470
have been incredibly miserable.
She got more CNN and coverage in Rwanda

525
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:32,120
and for right then the question is why?
Why does this happen and why do people

526
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:34,700
care so much?
And it turns out there's the research on

527
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,870
what's called the identifiable victim
effect and the question is if you have,

528
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,280
how many lives are at stake and how much
do we care you would that as more live?

529
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,740
So at stake,
we would care more maybe in the linear

530
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,890
relationship or maybe we will care more
in the beginning and they'll be kind of

531
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,380
a diminishing return.
Like we wouldn't care if it's 100 or a

532
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,210
thousand,
but we care a lot of the bottom range.

533
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,040
But it turns out the function is
different.

534
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,540
We care a lot about individual life and
you care less and less as the pie is the

535
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,220
number of people become bigger and this
goes to kind of an observation is both

536
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,390
stallion and Mother Teresa said,
Stalin said one death is a tragedy,

537
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,880
a million deaths is a statistic,
and mother Theresa said in the same

538
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,980
spirit,
if I look at the masters,

539
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:20,610
I will never act.
If I look at the one I will and both of

540
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:25,611
them basically portray this idea that
what happened when we kind of think

541
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:30,150
about recruiting ourselves to act
against something,

542
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,600
it's not about our mind thinking.
It's something about to call calculated,

543
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,590
thought about what's worthwhile and
what's the cost benefit analysis.

544
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,970
It's about our heart.
It's about our emotions and the question

545
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:46,290
is what can activate emotion and it
turns out that an individual case can

546
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:51,291
get us to care versus a big set of cases
just becomes statistics.

547
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,150
So this beautiful results by a depth
small and George Loewenstein and Paul

548
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,170
Slovic that basically say,
here's one girl in Africa who's hungry.

549
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,590
How much money would you give her?
And then two other people,

550
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,600
they say,
here's the problem of hunger in Africa,

551
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,740
they have 3 million kids in Sudan and
are 5 million kids here and this.

552
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,910
How much money would you give?
And people give half as much to Africa.

553
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:20,060
Then they give to the single girl Rokia.
It actually gets worse because you said

554
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,260
if people give more when it's emotional,
then when you statistical,

555
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,230
what happens when we give both
inflammation will say,

556
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:29,830
hey,
here's one girl Rokia.

557
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,520
Think,
see how sad she is and how much money

558
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:33,630
could help her.
By the way,

559
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,180
there's 5 million more like her.
What will happen?

560
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,300
It goes down.
It turns out that every time you

561
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,600
activate cognition,
calculation,

562
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,660
thoughtfulness,
you turn off the emotion.

563
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,070
People care less and give much less.
And of course this explains a little

564
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:50,970
bit,
Eh,

565
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,640
the,
the kind of imbalance between what we

566
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:57,540
give to and what we don't give to.
So think about how difficult it is to

567
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:02,541
get money for prevention of diseases,
prevention of malaria or prevention of

568
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:07,320
diarrhea or deworming kids in the world.
You know,

569
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:10,920
lots of kids have have worms.
And it turns out that those things are

570
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,320
incredibly important,
incredibly useful.

571
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:15,570
You can actually get people to be much,
much healthier,

572
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:17,370
but it's not motivating,
right?

573
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:20,700
Deworming of kids or you know,
a million kids in India just doesn't

574
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:25,290
make you feel warm and fuzzy or
preventing kids in the future from

575
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,990
getting malaria is again,
not that exciting.

576
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:32,991
But if you can help one person,
specific concrete get something,

577
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,740
we all get very excited from it.
So there is a real imbalance between

578
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:41,890
what really matters and what we care
about and what we give time and money

579
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:42,724
to.

580
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,940
If you run the not for profit,
of course you want to build on this on

581
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,090
the Russian art is because you care
about your non for profit.

582
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,450
And I think the example here is of
course the American cancer society.

583
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,700
They've done a really good job.
First of all,

584
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,600
the word cancer is great in,
in,

585
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,270
in,
in a minute,

586
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:02,380
recruiting where right?
It's an,

587
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:07,060
it's an awful disease.
The second thing is the word survivor is

588
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,580
really good.
And the third thing they do is they

589
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:11,800
create an incredible fear from cancer.
I mean,

590
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:14,800
the truth is we all have lots of cancer
and we all usually get,

591
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,150
get over it.
I mean,

592
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,240
some,
some people of course it dawned,

593
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,340
but in our lifetime we'll all have
cancerous cells and in most cases it

594
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:24,180
will be just part of the deal of living,
um,

595
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,250
but,
but they created these really negative

596
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:29,380
association that now everybody who had
cancer,

597
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:32,620
even if it was not malignant,
that will not cause them to die or it

598
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:35,230
was so slow,
it will take 50 years to develop and

599
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,030
they're called everybody at cancer
survival.

600
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,450
And because of that,
everybody who knows them and everybody

601
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:43,330
who cares about them start caring about
about cancer.

602
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,340
Now,
uh,

603
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,920
you know,
it's kind of interesting because they

604
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,370
basically have mastered this issue,
right?

605
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:51,490
They've mastered making it central
focal,

606
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,280
created very strong fear about,
about cancer and,

607
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,380
and caring embodied.
Then they basically get a lot of money

608
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,240
and if you look at them as a non for
profit,

609
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:04,300
they are an incredibly wealthy non for
profit.

610
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:06,060
In fact,
there are other non for profit field

611
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,530
that they're Kansas.
It is getting so much money that people

612
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:12,370
just don't give to other causes because
they give so much to that cause and now

613
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:16,840
there's all kinds of movements to
basically stop the status as a nonprofit

614
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,780
because they're so wealthy and they
spend so much money on salaries and,

615
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,280
and so on.
But,

616
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,310
but in a sense of understanding human
psychology,

617
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,110
uh,
they are the top.

618
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:26,944
Basically.

619
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,660
There's lots of lots of behavior like
this.

620
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:32,111
So,
so the,

621
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,340
the basic,
uh,

622
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,840
essence is a trade off between the short
term and long term.

623
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,550
Kind of a personal story about this,
uh,

624
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,540
when,
when I was in hospital a long time ago,

625
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:48,541
I got to liver disease from bad lunches,
fusion and for a long time they didn't

626
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,740
know what it was.
And from time to time I would get some

627
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,470
liver
infection.

628
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,440
And it was,
it was kind of bad in about seven years

629
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:59,620
after I got to India,
that was already out in the hospital.

630
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,750
I was in Grad school.
I had another flare up.

631
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:06,160
I checked myself into a hospital and
they found out it was hepatitis C and

632
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,780
they,
there was an experimental treatment at

633
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:10,300
that time called Interferon,
so why don't you try,

634
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,420
why don't you try this?
I was very happy to try it because you

635
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:18,400
know who would want to die from liver
cirrhosis and they basically got these

636
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:18,970
injections.

637
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,970
I had to inject myself three times a
week for a year and a half and these

638
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:28,090
injections basically symbolize for me,
they kind of the essence of the human

639
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:31,090
condition.
He was an injection that could

640
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:33,640
potentially be very useful for me 30
years later,

641
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,810
but what happened is that he also had
very bad side effects,

642
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,970
so every time I would take an that would
be sick for about 16 hours.

643
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,010
Vomiting,
shaking fever,

644
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,760
nothing really terrible compared to
liver cirrhosis,

645
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,800
but for sure unpleasant and now and
here's the question,

646
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,710
liver really important.
Injections,

647
00:32:55,711 --> 00:33:00,310
slightly important but now in for
certain and that's basically the trade

648
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,540
off we have everything.
It's about saving,

649
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,910
not good for now,
good for the future.

650
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,920
Exercising,
not good for now,

651
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,150
good for the future.
Dieting,

652
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,670
not good for now,
good for the future,

653
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,570
safe sex,
not so good for now,

654
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,500
good for the future.

655
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,580
Lots of things have this trade off in
terms of that when we face these

656
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,160
tradeoffs,
we often do what's called the present

657
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:22,670
bias focus.
We focus on the present too much and as

658
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:25,990
a consequence,
we undermine the long term,

659
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,870
the long term effect.
This is the problem with Adam and eve

660
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,400
and you can ask yourself,
you know,

661
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,750
who would ever give in eternity in the
garden of Eden for an apple?

662
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,600
Well,
if you ever texted and drive at the same

663
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,370
time,
you basically have done this mistake,

664
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,430
right?
And most people have texted while

665
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,070
driving and,
and,

666
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,870
and why do we do it?
It's not because we weigh the cost

667
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:51,440
benefit analysis and we say it's a
really good idea to text while driving.

668
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,100
It's because we're tempted at the moment
to do something that we realized it was

669
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,530
really stupid from the longterm
perspective.

670
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,140
Now,
back to my story,

671
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,000
when I,
after a year and a half,

672
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,710
uh,
there were two pieces of good news.

673
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,060
The first one was that my liver was
working fine and there was no trace of

674
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:10,730
the disease,
and the second thing is that doctors

675
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:14,570
told me was that I was the only patient
that I ever had who took the medication

676
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,760
on time.
The question is,

677
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,700
how could I do it?
Do I have nerves of steel and might not

678
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,170
succumb to the imputation?
The answer is,

679
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:23,570
of course,
we also come to temptation all the time.

680
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:28,160
There's no difference,
but what I did was I found a trick in my

681
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,020
trick is that I love movies.
If I had time,

682
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:34,340
I watched lots and lots of movies,
so every Monday,

683
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,510
Wednesday and Friday on the way to
school,

684
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:38,780
I would stop at a video store.
I would run two or three videos.

685
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:41,690
I really wanted to see how with carry
them in my backpack the whole day.

686
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,930
Anticipating watching them,
I would get home,

687
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,600
I would give myself the injection,
I would push a video in.

688
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,760
I would get the bucket that we get the
blanket.

689
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:52,550
I was already to the side effect and I
will start the video immediately.

690
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,740
I would wait for the side effect to
settle in.

691
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,760
I started immediately.
Now you can ask yourself,

692
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,150
do they really care about my liver?
And the answer is no.

693
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,080
The fact is that delivery is really
important in me and all the other

694
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:09,560
patients should have kept on taking your
medication on time because of the liver,

695
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,470
but it wasn't strong enough.
So what did I do?

696
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,000
I substituted deliver with movies.
Now you might say this is a stupid idea.

697
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:19,430
Liver is really important.
Movies not that crucial.

698
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,680
If you asked me what do I prefer,
movies or liver,

699
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,640
you know,
there's no question,

700
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,570
but because deliveries in the future,
it was vastly discounted because the

701
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:30,230
movies were in immediately.
It was actually motivating me and we

702
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:35,231
call this reward substitution when I
behave as if I care about my liver by

703
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:40,230
actually caring about movies and I think
there's actually a big lesson though.

704
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,420
You can think about how do we get people
to care about their health and money and

705
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,040
a longevity and so on.
Can we really get people to wake up

706
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,070
everyday and care about those things?
That will happen 30 years from now.

707
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,630
The answer is really very difficult,
expensive and unlikely,

708
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,720
but can we find other reward
substitution?

709
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,610
Can we get people to behave because of
other things in a way that would make

710
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:08,880
them behave as if they care about the
things that are doing for.

711
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,730
So why do people go to the gym,
right?

712
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,420
Do they really wake up every morning
worrying about how they will look,

713
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,240
feel like 30 years from now?
Probably not,

714
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:22,050
but can we get them to do some of these
about the moment that actually get them

715
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:26,310
to behave because they do something that
makes them care about behaviors if they

716
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:29,910
care about something else.
And I think that reward substitution

717
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:33,710
actually provides a general answer to
lots of problems in,

718
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,080
in human behavior.
We just need to find out what these

719
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:38,520
rewards can be.

720
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,890
Absolutely.
So if you think about the question of

721
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,660
trust and revenge,
that's a great example,

722
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,130
right?
The fact is that we're live in a

723
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:50,040
society.
We're inherently social animals,

724
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,750
unlike some other species,
and because of that we need things that

725
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:59,250
kind of connects us in a social way.
So we have this social utility in which

726
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,940
we just care about other people now
that's create lots of problems.

727
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:05,130
For example,
if you do a favor to me,

728
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,030
I like you more and then it might put me
in,

729
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,990
in,
in conflict of interest because they

730
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:14,991
would want to reciprocate in some way or
in a trust and revenge and all of those

731
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:18,210
things.
So the fact is that there are some

732
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:22,050
things that we are irrational and we
would have liked to fix it,

733
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,710
but there are some things where
irrationalities actually what allows us

734
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:30,711
to live in a society and if we lived as
individual organisms that basically had

735
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:33,900
no social ties and we're just working
each one of us separately,

736
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:36,270
it will be a very different social
structure,

737
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,990
but we might want to actually have
different strategies for decision

738
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:40,290
making.

739
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,840
But because we're inherently social
animals,

740
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:47,520
there's all kinds of things that make
that are irrational from the perspective

741
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:49,980
of thinking that everybody's a social is
a,

742
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,450
is a selfish maximizer,
but nevertheless make sense when you

743
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:57,750
think about people as social items.
The other thing of course is about

744
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:01,350
processing information.
So the fact is that we have a limited

745
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,070
brain,
you know,

746
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,650
we're kind of limited physically in many
ways,

747
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,570
right?
We can jump very high.

748
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,910
We can't sustain cold or heat.
I mean,

749
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,940
think about all the stuff in the world
that we do to make yourself more

750
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:15,660
comfortable.
We have chairs and clothes and glasses

751
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:16,500
and headphones.
I mean,

752
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,980
lots and lots of stuff.
It turns out our brain is also not

753
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:20,621
perfect,
right?

754
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,500
In the same way that our bodies are not
perfect,

755
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,080
we can't do everything we would like to
do.

756
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,090
We're not superman and our brain is also
not perfect.

757
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,130
Our brains process information in a
certain way,

758
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,650
and the reality that we experience is
not out there.

759
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:33,480
It's in here.
That's what gives us the.

760
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:38,481
The brain gives us the world brought to
us courtesy of our brain and it's

761
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,020
processing ability and because the brain
is not perfect,

762
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,310
the way we get information and process
it is also not perfect and that's just

763
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:53,311
kind of functional structural
limitations to how rational we can be.

764
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,990
And the fact is that we better recognize
if it's really good to recognize it,

765
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,610
understand the limitation,
then act accordingly.

766
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,850
Because if we don't,
we'll just make more and more mistake.

767
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:05,620
We'll just assume that we can be
perfect.

768
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,780
We'll create the world as if people
would create,

769
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,310
can be perfect.
And we'll just set ourselves to this

770
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:11,590
appointment time after time.
