1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,990
Early on,
it seemed as if Muhammad's ambition was

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:07,190
simply to go from door to door,
from passion to person and say,

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,130
you know,
leave alone what you believe in.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,300
Believe in the one God,
the one who spoke to me through the

5
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:17,780
Angel Jubril.
That's how you say it in Arabic and

6
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:22,781
Gabrielle in English
and then extort people to do certain

7
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:28,610
things that in the 21st century we
understand has religion,

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,910
prayer,
fasting congregations,

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,320
that sort of thing.
In the first 10 years in Mecca,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,010
I would say largely harmless.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,920
There's that Mohammed and in a very
modern way,

12
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,290
I don't know if you know Dr Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,890
but you could understand him as a doctor
checkup.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,960
Then he goes to Medina and then you have
the Mr hired side of Mohammed.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,890
Suddenly there's a militia and now he's
a politician.

16
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,260
He's not only preaching,
please come to the one God is demanding,

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,310
come to the one God and accept me as a
profit and if not,

18
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:17,311
I declare war and he declares war and
with a relatively small militia,

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,330
at least according to the Islamic
perception this is,

20
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:27,331
these are other Muslim documents with a
relatively small militia or a small

21
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:34,180
number of men,
he defeats a much larger,

22
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,570
much more well established army and that
victory leads to another victory and it

23
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:44,170
leads to another victory to another
victory.

24
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:48,220
But it also leads to complexities
because the more he gains power,

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,120
he has a say over more people and that
then leads to the necessity of

26
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:55,534
legislation.

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,780
In hindsight,
if you're in the 21st century,

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,650
you are a political scientist,
a sociologist or psychologist,

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,020
historian,
any kind of social scientist,

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,830
you look back in that time,
you agreed that matter to you will be

31
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,360
impressed.
You'll see goodness.

32
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,930
This man was great.
He defeated large armies,

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,780
he established an empire,
he legislator,

34
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,990
he kept them together and he left a
narrative behind that lasted many

35
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,550
centuries well beyond.
He was born wonderful.

36
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,580
Of course,
I don't argue with that.

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,690
But
what he also did was he froze his

38
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,930
innovation in place.
He was the last prophet.

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,430
Nobody else could come and innovate on
what he said.

40
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,290
In fact,
he declares innovation,

41
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,980
the biggest sin that I believe I can
commit,

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,880
thus the fate of the heretics of his
life.

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,080
And so if you,
if you take Muhammad's as the Steve Jobs

44
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:02,410
or you know,
the seventh century,

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,220
I want you to imagine,
I want you to think of a steve jobs

46
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,850
leaving a legacy behind where he says
you can never end.

47
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,630
You may never change the minute he finds
himself on his deathbed,

48
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,930
never change
the iphone four or the IPAD air,

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,970
I forget which condition these things
were back then or the mark.

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,200
So that's Tim Cook would never have,
he would only have one thing which would

51
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:37,201
be to continue it and to say these are
timeless and that's pretty much what

52
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,270
Muhammad did.
The Koran is a timeless document.

53
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,750
His example is rendered timeless and I
think that is a disservice that Mohammed

54
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,700
did to his own innovation.
His great achievement was the fact that

55
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,810
he managed.
If,

56
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,060
if,
if that narrative,

57
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,040
again,
that narrative is a contested narrative,

58
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,200
but if that narrative is true,
his greatest innovation was to unite the

59
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,830
Arabs,
make them transcend themselves,

60
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,220
unites into a super tribe and conquer.
But the biggest mistake he then made

61
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,040
would be to freeze things in place.
And that is the curse of Islam.

62
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:23,041
Is this
the fact that innovation is a sin,

63
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,210
innovation is a bad thinking.
They close the gates freezer.

64
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,550
That is the curse of it.
That's the firewall to Islamic thinking.

65
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,170
And we can see the result in everyday
life.

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,460
Again,
I repeat.

67
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,300
It's a perception of the people who put
these beliefs into practice.

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,600
What really happened is still a massive
study.

69
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,380
Okay.
