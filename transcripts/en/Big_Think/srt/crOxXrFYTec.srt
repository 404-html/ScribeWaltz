00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,140
Hi Bill,
so you know me as a producer at big

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,150
thing and my question for you is my
favorite question for all of our desks,

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,070
which is that keeps you up at night.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,760
What keeps me up at night?
Climate Change,

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,610
climate change keeps me up at night.
Everywhere I looked,

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,610
there were opportunities to be
addressing climate change and everywhere

7
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:29,611
I look we're not doing it and by we I
mean not just humankind writ large,

8
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:34,360
but my United States where I grew up,
where I went to engineering school where

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:38,710
I worked as an engineer trying to make
the world better for somebody and we are

10
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:43,711
missing all these opportunities.
It's just crazy making and this is by

11
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:48,940
the way why I'm very proud to be the CEO
of the Planetary Society.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,580
We are accomplishing something in space.
We are getting things done in space and

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,730
I claim that space exploration is good
for everybody.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,390
So it's not the Apollo era.
We're not devoting 10 percent of the

15
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:09,181
world's largest government
funding to this one thing.

16
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,630
We're spending about point four percent
be nice if it were point five percent,

17
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:17,110
but we're spending a reasonable amount
of our intellect and treasure on

18
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:21,700
learning about the cosmos and the
Planetary Society works very hard to

19
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:25,270
direct that expenditure in what we think
is the best,

20
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:26,440
most efficient way today.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,980
By the way,
right now is the press conference about

22
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:33,280
what instruments will be put on the
Europa mission.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,440
This is a spacecraft going to the moon
of Jupiter called Europa.

24
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:43,150
Looking to see if it's habitable are,
is there a chance that are living things

25
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:44,950
they're such a discovery would change
the world.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,460
With that said,
climate change keeps me up at night,

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,500
but the opportunities that we're
missing,

28
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:53,620
it's just crazy.
Making these people who are in denial of

29
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,630
climate change.
Look,

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,320
if you're a denial list and this will
probably find its way to you and you

31
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:04,150
will post these crazy,
mean spirited comments about me and

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,790
knock yourself out,
it's fine with that.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
Brings you joy.
Okay,

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,040
but if somebody told you that there is
no connection whatsoever between smoking

35
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:19,450
and cancer,
would you vote for that person?

36
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,230
Would that be somebody you trust now,
50 years after that discovery was made?

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,110
Well,
the connection between humans and

38
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:33,760
climate change is about that strong and
by some very reasonable modern

39
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:35,920
statistical reckoning,
slightly stronger.

40
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,900
So if you're a denier out there,
I strongly encourage you to cut it out.

41
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,290
Just change,
just get to work.

42
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,150
There's nobody more passionate about the
environment than the guy who just built

43
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:52,390
his log cabin.
There's nobody who wants you to quit

44
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:55,960
smoking more strongly than the guy who
just quit.

45
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,940
Or the Gal who just quit.
There's no more antismoking advocate

46
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,190
stronger than the person who just quit
smoking.

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,590
So if you're a denier out there,
you could change and we embrace you and

48
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:13,591
we could get to work and the
opportunities are renewable energy,

49
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,460
transmission of electricity.
Electricity is like magical energy,

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,580
electricity,
storage or energy storage.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
And then if that's from an engineering
standpoint,

52
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:30,121
and then the huge opportunity is to
create a system where people have to pay

53
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:35,341
for the carbon dioxide they create and
then take those funds that,

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,270
that treasure and redirect it into basic
research so that we can,

55
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,280
dare I say it,
change the world,

56
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,870
and then I could sleep at night.
