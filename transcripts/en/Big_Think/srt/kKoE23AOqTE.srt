1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,020
Look,
we we,

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,420
we are still hopeful that President
Obama will make,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,310
will keep the promises he made his
candidate,

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,180
but there was some early signs that
we're not going down the right path.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,330
He told us we would reject the military
commissions act,

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,750
and yet now he's talking about retaining
the military commissions as a way to

7
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,120
deal with some of the detainees at
Guantanamo.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,640
Huge mistake,
you can't fix that.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,460
You got scrap.
It got throw these individuals and to

10
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:36,690
establish courts,
you can't tinker at the edges with the

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,420
Military Commissions Act.
He told us he would restore the rule of

12
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:43,920
law and yet now he's telling us that he
wants to elect a preventive detention

13
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,780
regime,
which is essentially a nice word for

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,240
holding people indefinitely without
charge or trial.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,760
Can't do that.
That's not the American way.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,430
We've never allowed that for hundreds of
years.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,460
America cannot hold people who we are
suspicious of merely because they may

18
00:00:58,741 --> 00:00:59,490
pose a threat.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,830
If you can't prove it,
you can't take away someone's

20
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:06,831
fundamental right to liberty and do so
in a way that doesn't a convict the

21
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:11,850
person in a court of law that's just,
it's anathema to the fourth and fifth

22
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,610
amendments.
You have the president telling us that

23
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:19,611
he was going to make good on some core
issues around gay rights and questions

24
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:24,400
around equality in America.
That seemed to be very slow in coming.

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,803
Uh,
you know,

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,530
saying that I'm going to give gay,
lesbian people.

27
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:32,910
They're full rights as individuals and
yet defending the defensive marriage

28
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,160
act.
It doesn't compute,

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,140
frankly,
if,

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,390
if,
if those promises were made,

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,210
you can't defend the defense of marriage
act.

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,400
You can't drag your feet.
Don't ask,

33
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,100
don't tell.
And I think one of the concerns we have

34
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,250
is that the president is saying,
I have all these other issues that are

35
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,170
on the front burner,
the economy,

36
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,550
the wars,
healthcare.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,370
We all get that.
We're all Americans.

38
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:59,340
We all care about people dying in wars.
We all care about health care,

39
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:03,990
we all care about the economy,
but frankly we can't wait to fix all

40
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,360
those problems before we get to some
really important problems.

41
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:06,870
Uh,
he,

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,210
he and he alone in his garment
conflicts.

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,780
You can't sequence in a way that's going
to.

44
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,300
You got to fix the economy,
the healthcare and the environment and

45
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,520
the wars,
and then we'll turn to gay people and

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,240
the administration of Justice and
detainees and torture and abuse.

47
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,860
It's not,
we're not,

48
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,700
we're never going to get to.
And frankly everyone knows that it's the

49
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:31,370
first 18 months of an administration
that will allow him the room and the

50
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,020
latitude to make decisive breaks with
the past.

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,500
And unless we,
we occupied that initial window with

52
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,450
some really bold,
decisive actions,

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,060
we'll find ourselves in a new reelection
campaign.

54
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,960
We'll find ourselves with pundits on
both sides saying differ these issues

55
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,961
further until the second term.
And frankly a dream deferred is a dream

56
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:54,390
last.
And frankly a time is not a luxury we

57
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,600
can afford ourselves when it comes to
core issues like due process and human

58
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,960
rights and equality.
And that's why we're hoping by putting

59
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:04,500
his feet to the fire and these issues
that who get the political will to do

60
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:04,950
the right thing.
