1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Software unification
so that I no longer care what computing

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,390
device I pick up,
whether it's a laptop or a desktop,

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,900
whether it's one I own or one in a
public place,

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,450
uh,
whether it has a small screen or a large

5
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:29,770
screen.
Uh,

6
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:31,600
I sit down,
identify myself,

7
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,390
I tune in my information world.
Uh,

8
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:38,530
I get it in the same way on a no screen
computer in a car.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Um,
uniform access across all platforms,

10
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:48,610
computers,
telephones to my entire information

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,120
life.
It's easy to achieve in hardware.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,370
They're hard software issues,
but they should have been solved 15

13
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:58,204
years ago.

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,260
So long from the other side of the fence
is,

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,270
um,
if I were to invest in a,

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,780
in a new company,
I would invest in some of the companies

17
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:14,260
that are working on so-called digital
furnaces.

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,330
Uh,
in five years,

19
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:19,360
everybody throws out all his cds and
dvds.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,750
There are larger MP3 players,
a home stereo systems and t v V systems

21
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:29,770
are integrated and this is a billion
multibillion dollar transition.

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,080
As things stand,
it will be Sony and Google a Toshiba,

23
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,300
a few with very large companies doing it
and they won't,

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,280
they won't do it badly,
but they won't do it.

25
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,420
Well.
Uh,

26
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:44,530
I would invest in,
in one of the small companies that has

27
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:48,190
imaginative instead of recycled ideas as
to how to make that transition.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,550
Um,
in two ways.

29
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:59,570
The service that print media
traditionally makes available,

30
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,670
um,
is editing,

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,510
which can turn
almost,

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,630
almost unintelligible random words into
intelligible language depending on how

33
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,960
good a writer you're dealing with.
Uh,

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,970
the vast majority of mankind today
writes badly and finds it difficult to,

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,060
may have good ideas,
but finds it difficult to write more

36
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,300
than an articulate sentence.
I'm really judging by my students,

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,650
um,
uh,

38
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,180
each year my students at,
yeah,

39
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,800
which is a good university.
We get very good.

40
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:34,730
Students are less and less able to
express themselves in writing.

41
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,010
So the print media,
um,

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,550
more than ever provides,
um,

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,050
uh,
editing and provides,

44
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,150
um,
authority,

45
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,510
respectability.
If I go to a new stand 30 years ago and

46
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,000
there are five newspapers,
it's important for me to know that I

47
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,640
trust this newspaper.
And I don't trust that one.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,620
But if today I go to the web and there
are 30,000 sites,

49
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:05,980
it's even more important for me to go to
a site,

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,490
which I have some reason to trust
consistently over the longterm.

51
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,650
I think the print media have failed to
make the most of their opportunity.

52
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,320
They know they may have all disappear
because they're approaching things in

53
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,760
the wrong way,
but,

54
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,790
but editing to produce coherent readable
text and authority so that readers know

55
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,270
how to spend,
no matter how much information there is.

56
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,050
I asked the same number of minutes in my
day and,

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,530
and I need to look to sources I trust
beginning with a print media,

58
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,390
newspapers,
I read magazines,

59
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:41,770
I read publishers I trust to give me
advice as to how to spend those minutes.

60
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,260
Print media will flourish if it does
that.

61
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,670
Don't know that it will.

62
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,520
The first part of your question,
um,

63
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,340
livestreaming is,
we defined it in first implemented it

64
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,220
back in the mid 1990s.
Um,

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,720
was a time based versus space are
surface based organization of

66
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:05,200
information.
The idea was that every electronic

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,020
assets you had,
every piece of information,

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,930
whether it was an email or an instant
message,

69
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,090
whether it was a,
a file or a spreadsheet,

70
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:17,380
whether it was a photo or an MP,
three would appear in a single time

71
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:22,381
ordered stream that mirrored the
evolution of your life.

72
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,210
So in principle,
the first thing on the stream would be

73
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,910
my birth certificate and the electronic
version of that.

74
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,300
My parents would put my records,
school records,

75
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:32,160
health records,
whatever,

76
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:36,830
when on a child onto the stream.
And the Stream is um,

77
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,830
uh,
continues to flow forward through time.

78
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,000
I can deal with the future is available
to me as well as the past.

79
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,100
So I can search in the past,
find what I want,

80
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,140
everything is fully indexed.
Um,

81
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,240
if,
if when I schedule things,

82
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,490
when I know things are coming up,
I put them in the future.

83
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,610
When I have something that I need to
return to that I don't have time for

84
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,810
now,
I put it in the future.

85
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,741
So,
uh,

86
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,500
and together without,
we had an interface,

87
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,250
um,
we thought it was important not to make

88
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,010
use only or the surface of the screen,
uh,

89
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,580
but to uh,
present displays in depth that made use

90
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,400
of the other virtual depth of the
screen.

91
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:19,870
So I wasn't looking at a surface,
I was more looking through a window into

92
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,390
an arbitrarily large information
landscape.

93
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,050
So instead of the mouse just moving a
cursor over the surface,

94
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,330
it would be a robot vehicle,
uh,

95
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,450
moving through three space or some
arbitrary space.

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,150
Um,
the basic idea was simple,

97
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,690
just a chronological timeline,
heterogeneous with absolutely everything

98
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,040
on it.
Um,

99
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,670
we have seen it a commercialized in two
different ways.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,860
Um,
one way I,

101
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,940
the one that I'm allowed to talk about
it,

102
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,290
I no longer own these patents.
The patents have changed hands and the

103
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,260
patents are now subjective at enormous
lawsuit against Apple,

104
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,290
which is not mine because I don't know,
the patent I'm told is the largest

105
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,680
lawsuit in patent history.
Alcohol took these ideas.

106
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm not in a position to say they stole
them.

107
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:10,710
I don't know if they did or not legally.
But these ideas are the basis of apples,

108
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,900
uh,
cover flow,

109
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,940
the way they display,
uh,

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,890
originally.
Um,

111
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,760
uh,
songs on itunes cover flow is now become

112
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,870
a standard way of displaying files on
virtually all apple platforms,

113
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,580
spotlight,
um,

114
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,080
which allows you to find files not by
name or folder,

115
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,100
but by content.

116
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,440
Um,
and time machine,

117
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,930
which is a,
a series of,

118
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,340
of archive things,
um,

119
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,910
without commenting on the legal aspects,
which I'm not capable of doing.

120
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,880
Those are like,
those are live streams and there are

121
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,980
other companies that have done similar
things.

122
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,300
Um,
that makes me angry personally,

123
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,110
not because of the money,
but because of the deliberate failure to

124
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:59,111
acknowledge work that we would have made
freely available as academics.

125
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,710
And that,
uh,

126
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,210
companies nowadays will not acknowledge
it because there's so much money

127
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,610
involved.
The same time on the network,

128
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,020
there are thousands of groups that are,
that are building livestreams or live

129
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,390
streaming for themselves in their own
way.

130
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,820
We love to see this activity.
There's a live stream,

131
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,740
that blog talking about all the
different life finger.

132
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,210
So,
so that's,

133
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,520
that's great.
And for that matter,

134
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:25,700
we're delighted to see apple do it too.
Um,

135
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,130
but when they're large companies that
work on it,

136
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,790
which is also the case with,
with friend feed,

137
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,080
um,
with the,

138
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,470
with the event stream,
um,

139
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,460
on facebook,
uh,

140
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,160
which is,
which is true of the aol aol Bebo

141
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,140
Stream,
which they actually call a live stream

142
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:42,974
or live streaming.

143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
Um,
it's not,

144
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,190
uh,
it's not as if we want to stop that

145
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,620
activity,
shut it down,

146
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,080
but we'd like to see credit where credit
is due,

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
not just to me or even mean mainly to
me,

148
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,820
but to the graduate student actually
built the software,

149
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,610
worked tremendously hard,
published the papers,

150
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,444
put them in,
you know,

151
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,100
made them available and uh,
we'd like to see credit awarded.

152
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,270
There are certain subjects we'd seem to
me can be taught very effectively

153
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,260
online,
although they aren't.

154
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,570
I would love to see writing taught
online because of the university like

155
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,300
Yale,
much less than a high school where my

156
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:26,630
boys went to school,
a public high school in new haven in

157
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,810
Connecticut.
There are not enough teachers who are

158
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,690
able to teach writing well or in some
cases there are none.

159
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,900
Well there are always a few.
Teaching somebody to write is a isn't a

160
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,390
labor intensive activity.
I have to go through somebody's paper

161
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:45,080
and mark it up as a copy editor would do
sentence by sentence and I have to do

162
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:49,940
that repeatedly.
Now I could have a student take a hate

163
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:53,920
the paper and send it to somebody in
Alaska or India or anywhere who's

164
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,540
capable of doing it.
A worldwide network of writing,

165
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,210
teaching would be very effective.

166
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,280
It doesn't exist.
We don't have the right software tools.

167
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,480
We will at some point similarly for
marking exercises,

168
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,640
quantitative exercises,
uh,

169
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,060
maybe not so much in mathematics,
but certainly problem sets in physics

170
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,120
and chemistry and engineering and,
and things like that.

171
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,760
Uh,
where we're answers and methods are

172
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,300
clear cotton.
Um,

173
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,600
absolutely.
I would like to see that done online.

174
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,390
Um,
I think the universities as we know them

175
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:27,840
will be dead in 10 or 15 years.
I would like to see them replaced by

176
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,490
something better instead of something
worse.

177
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:33,210
And it's not clear which way it will go,
but the book is,

178
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:38,211
I'm abolishing the book is like
abolishing the symphony or Sonata form

179
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,190
or the sonic or,
or the wall painting.

180
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,090
Uh,
the,

181
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,140
the book is a form in which some of the
greatest masterpieces that mankind has

182
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,660
ever achieve.
Our are expressed.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Um,
uh,

184
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
not only fiction,
but uh,

185
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,550
but uh,
they're great biographies.

186
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,270
Biographies is the greatest story.
And,

187
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,740
uh,
there are great science books that were

188
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,040
conceived as books,
Fiman Savers,

189
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,830
introductory lectures and physics,
which have a beginning and an end which

190
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:10,880
are written with style and penalize.
The book is,

191
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:14,460
is a unit and um,
it's such a brilliant Ergonomic unit.

192
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
Um,
and I take a book,

193
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,190
I can judge a book by its cover.
I can glance at it from the outside,

194
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:23,370
know what it is.
I can tell if it's a novel or a textbook

195
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,800
or a history book.
I can look at the side and tell about

196
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,040
how long it is.
I can flip through it and I don't need a

197
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,920
map to know that the,
where the table of contents are.

198
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,380
The index is,
I can find the photograph.

199
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,810
If they're a second no photographs,
I can write on it,

200
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,910
which is tremendously important.
If I read a book,

201
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,440
the,
the value to it,

202
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,310
to me and having the book another time
is to remember what I said,

203
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,350
what I wanted to know and so forth.

204
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,440
It's portable.
I don't have to worry about stepping on

205
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,730
it accidentally or I,
you know,

206
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,820
I can use it on the beach.
I can use it on anywhere.

207
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,950
Standing up in a boss.
I can.

208
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,263
It's,
uh,

209
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,360
it is the greatest design,
I think,

210
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,280
in the history of ergonomics.
I wrote a piece around it as long time

211
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,270
it,
we still have books because there are

212
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:09,640
so,
they're so brilliantly there.

213
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,410
They're there so brilliantly suited to
the way human beings absorbed

214
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,770
information and at their best.
They're among the most beautiful things

215
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,630
we have.
Um,

216
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,560
uh,
it's,

217
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,600
uh,
it's terrible to think of.

218
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,370
They're disappearing,
surviving only in,

219
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:26,730
in libraries,
but that's not going to happen.

220
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,560
People are too smart to allow it.
Even if the industry sometimes seems so

221
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,600
oblivious that it wouldn't care.
