1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,493
A few years ago,
a leading scientific company had a 

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,253
specific challenge.
It was a toothpaste company and they 

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,570
make different fluorides for their 
toothpaste,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,793
but there was a big mechanical problem.
The fluoride was getting stuck in the 

5
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:20,994
equipment and it wasn't meshing well.
The company had engaged all their top 

6
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:28,800
chemists to try to figure out what the 
problem was and no one could solve it.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,903
It was taking months and months and time
and costing hundreds of thousands of 

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,750
dollars at that point.
So the executive on the team said,

9
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,300
you know what?
We have not been able to solve this.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,433
Who else could we engage?
What other networks could help us solve 

11
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,094
this problem?
So the company ended up posting this 

12
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,860
fluoride challenge on a website called 
Inno centive,

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,023
which is a community of crowdsource 
scientists who come together to help 

14
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,820
large companies solve scientific 
challenges.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,020
Within a few days of posting this 
fluoride challenge,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,010
a physicist who lived in Canada looked 
at the problem online and said,

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,780
this isn't a chemistry problem.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,150
It's a physics problem.
It's about charged particles.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,700
You charge the fluoride one way the 
toothpaste the other.

20
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:12,534
Instantly the problem was solved.
Colgate realized a few things from this 

21
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:16,794
experience.
The first thing is that they never even 

22
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:23,280
dare to ask the physicists at their own 
company because they had labeled it as a

23
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,114
chemistry problem.
The other thing they realize is that 

24
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,390
physicists that solved the problem may 
have never been hired by colgate.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,253
He didn't have the traditional resume.
He had had different careers throughout 

26
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,390
his life,
and so in today's world,

27
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,224
we can access and engage expertise in a 
radically different way to find real 

28
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:42,474
time solutions,
and those that may have the answers are 

29
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,164
those that choose to contribute.
They may not be who we suspect are the 

30
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:52,620
right people to contribute.
In my book,

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,800
get big things done,
the power of connectional intelligence,

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,873
my coauthor Nicole,
Joe and I and I distilled connectional 

33
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:03,330
intelligence into five specific traits.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,553
We looked at companies and leaders 
around the world and found that there 

35
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:07,914
were specific skillsets that you could 
use to build your own connectional 

36
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,744
intelligence,
and they are called the five c's of 

37
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,254
connectional intelligence.
The first C is curiosity and we all 

38
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:23,610
think about curiosity is the ability to 
ask great questions,

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,580
but from a connectional intelligence 
perspective,

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,850
curiosity is the ability to design your 
questions so that other networks outside

41
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:36,150
of your own can engage to help you solve
those problems.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,030
So if you think about when you're 
solving a problem today,

43
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:42,930
how can you not only be curious to ask 
who you traditionally go to,

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,093
but how might you design your question 
to engage a new community at different 

45
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,014
resource and outside perspective from 
another company or even outside your 

46
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:56,880
industry that could lead to a new and 
different breakthrough solution.

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,570
The second C of intelligence is 
combination and combination,

48
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,600
as we all know,
is the root of innovation.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,433
Combining disparate ideas,
people and resources to come up with 

50
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,540
something entirely new and different.
So as you think about combination,

51
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,374
how are you leveraging your combination 
skills of different resources within 

52
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,080
your company,
across teams,

53
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:24,220
across business units,
at different levels in different regions

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,233
of the organization and far beyond with 
companies and customers and other 

55
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,640
stakeholders that could help create and 
forge new business solutions,

56
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,653
new opportunities,
and address challenges that you may be 

57
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,690
facing.
The third C of connectional intelligence

58
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,583
is courage and we all know that courage 
is such a key part of all of all of the 

59
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,314
key ways of connecting.
And when I define courage from a 

60
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:50,704
connectional intelligence perspective,
it's really the ability to be able to 

61
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,630
have difficult in different types of 
conversations,

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,733
but not just raise those conversations,
being willing to amplify and sustain 

63
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
them over time because we know that 
having a onetime connection doesn't 

64
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,410
create breakthroughs.

65
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,573
It's those people that are willing to be
courageous to continue those 

66
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:17,590
conversations over time.
Often it could take years to really lead

67
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,424
to that breakthrough,
but it's that sustaining of the 

68
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,840
courageous conversation that creates 
that.

69
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,674
So as you think about your own courage,
how many courageous conversations are 

70
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,144
you having every day?
Are you sustaining those conversations 

71
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,864
over time and what might be those forms 
or avenues that would allow you to 

72
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,604
amplify your own courage?
Who Do you surround yourself with and 

73
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,070
make connections with that makes you 
courageous yourself?

74
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,653
The fourth C of connectional 
intelligence is community and we all 

75
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,660
know that community is such a big aspect
of this.

76
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,494
Finding different networks of people 
that can care about similar things that 

77
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,354
can spark ideas together.
And what we found with connectional 

78
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:58,894
intelligence as those that really tap 
into this superpower are those that see 

79
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,264
communities far beyond traditional 
forums far beyond the traditional 

80
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:07,850
hierarchies.

81
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,683
So it could be a community of moms in 
the company at Unilever that have a new 

82
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,150
way of thinking about what their 
customers might need.

83
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,253
Or it could be a network of Latino 
employees at Frito lay who realize that 

84
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,864
there's an opportunity for a guacamole,
doritos chips that turned into $100 

85
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,883
million dollar product for the business.
So communities can be far beyond our 

86
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:31,774
traditional spectrums of what people's 
roles and traditional sources of 

87
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,344
expertise are.
So as you think about your own 

88
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:40,330
communities,
what communities are you involved with?

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,193
What informal formal communities,
what internal and external communities 

90
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,260
do you engage with and how might you be 
able to leverage them,

91
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:50,200
not just for what they're traditionally 
known for,

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,230
but what other problems they could solve
for you,

93
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,090
for your team,
your company,

94
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,924
and beyond.
And the last C of connectional 

95
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,000
intelligence is combustion.
So once you have courage,

96
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,330
curiosity,
community combination,

97
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,720
it's about how do you allow it to 
mobilize income.

98
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,554
Bust combustion is the ability to 
mobilize and curate your communities to 

99
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,084
create added value.
So it's when you've built your 

100
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:19,100
community,
it's when you've tapped into the courage

101
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,963
of that community that allows those 
people to create value in a new and 

102
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,064
different way.
