1
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,660
It's always useful journalistically to
remember the kind of sine curve of a

2
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,560
defeat in victory.
I remember I've just a couple of months

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,393
ago,
we ran a cover,

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,410
um,
that had,

5
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:21,920
uh,
three,

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,570
four panels and Obama in three of them
is walking across water in radiant

7
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:27,380
light,
like,

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,120
you know,
the great biblical figure.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,910
And in the fourth panel,
he falls in the water.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,670
This was at the nadir of the healthcare
debate.

11
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,160
It looked like he was quite possibly
going to lose.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,340
There was already talk about how
horrible November,

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,430
uh,
elections were going to be for the

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,250
Democratic Party.
And then he turns it around and he won.

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,650
He didn't win a bipartisan victory by
any means.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,140
In fact,
the main politicking had to be within

17
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,390
the Democratic Party to put,
put it over.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,350
But all that said,
he wanted an enormous victory and the

19
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:00,470
momentum of the presidency changed.
How long that'll last.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,500
Will it have any bearing on what happens
in November?

21
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:06,200
We'll,
as those reports always say,

22
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,100
we'll wait and see.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,190
Even though that Obama's political
reflex is political personality,

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,340
uh,
aims toward conciliation.

25
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,120
It's certainly what made him a political
animal is early as Harvard law school.

26
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:27,720
It's how he got to be the president of
the law review by drawing in

27
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,540
conservatives as well as liberals,
is how he's succeeded.

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,210
He's not a fool.
He sees reality.

29
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:37,380
He sees the,
the par partisan divisiveness in the

30
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,660
congress.
He wants to win.

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,830
This is not some kind of pie eyed
idealist look at the healthcare bill.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,480
That bill can tracked it and it was
shaped over time in ways he may not have

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,730
wanted,
but he wanted to win.

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,030
He did not want to walk out of there a
gallant loser.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,480
Um,
conciliation is also not a strategy that

36
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,710
will necessarily work with a pretty
stubborn international forces.

37
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:05,390
Conciliation is not a necessarily a,
um,

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,390
uh,
or charm is not something that's going

39
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:09,950
to work with Mukmood,
Almadina,

40
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,260
Jod,
uh,

41
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,020
or any other,
uh,

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,690
you know,
any other political force of that.

43
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,040
Like,
um,

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,480
there's also a toughness to him.
It's not toughness that's obstreperous

45
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,220
and,
and a swaggering,

46
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,960
but he's capable of it.
