1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,270
You syllables answer,
it would be nine 11.

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,660
I was working at the Wall Street Journal
at the time.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,890
My main job was as an editor in the days
and weeks and months after nine 11,

4
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:22,110
I spent all my time,
uh,

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,140
editing stories for the Journal's front
page about the fallout from nine 11,

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,450
most of it international,
uh,

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,750
at least initially.
And I edited many stories about Islam

8
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,900
and about Muslims and about the turmoil
that has enveloped,

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,880
uh,
that religion and its adherence.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,970
Uh,
almost all of that had to do with Islam

11
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:44,280
overseas and Muslims,
uh,

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,950
outside the boundaries of the United
States.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,780
I genuinely just began to get curious
over time about Muslims in this country

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,360
and the journal was chased from its
offices by nine 11.

15
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:57,850
The,
uh,

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,380
the attacks took place literally across
the street from the journal offices and

17
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:04,170
for a year we were dispersed in
different places when the newspaper

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,850
recollected itself and its old office.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,420
As in my work life became a little bit
more normal again.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,720
Um,
I decided to carve out some time to work

21
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,790
on a series of articles about Muslims in
this country.

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,780
And increasingly as I did those
articles,

23
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,260
I realized that one,
the American Muslim experience was an

24
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:27,261
entirely distinct from Muslim immigrant
experiences elsewhere and even more

25
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:32,130
distinct from the experience of Muslims
in the predominantly Muslim world.

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,710
And as I got deeper and deeper into that
and found the tremendous variety within

27
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:42,711
American Islam and found the tremendous
flux that exists within that subject

28
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,440
area,
that there is no one American Islam,

29
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,210
there is no one model of American Muslim
and that Muslims themselves in this

30
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:56,211
country in a way that is mostly very
healthy and very encouraging.

31
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,370
When you come to understand it,
are engaged in a,

32
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:04,110
in an extraordinary debate over what it
means to be a Muslim in a wealthy

33
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:06,330
Western society,
particularly the united that of the

34
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:09,570
United States,
that that began to have the feel of

35
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,540
enough of a having enough heft to be
worthy,

36
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,940
not just of newspaper articles,
but maybe have a book.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,030
And the struggle that the,
uh,

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
that you mentioned that I used as the
subtitle for the book that struggle is

39
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:25,500
the internal struggle within Islam in
this country.

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,120
Much of what I write about in the book
has to do with conflicts among Muslims

41
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,100
in this country from many different
backgrounds,

42
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:36,000
with many different understandings of
their own religion as they try to sort

43
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,130
out what it means to be Muslim.
