1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,000
Farmers inducer this,
this loop,

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,390
I don't know,
old world breathing,

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,170
which is a,
they have a bore and the south,

4
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:17,050
so they do natural breeding,
uh,

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,450
Mo,
like 99% of the breeding pigs.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,650
Uh,
for one,

7
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:23,360
it happens with a lot of animals.
Pigs,

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,470
uh,
specifically,

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,520
uh,
is done with,

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,500
with um,
uh,

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,790
frozen semen.
Uh,

12
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,320
it was basically artificial
insemination,

13
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,850
so they had these super bores,
you know,

14
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:33,380
I've,
which there's like,

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,800
uh,
something like 2000 super bores that

16
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,610
they take the semen from and that that
gets impregnated into the south,

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,000
uh,
um,

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,360
and in,
in the industrial level because,

19
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,500
um,
they don't,

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,200
they want the good genetics.
And there are certain boards that have

21
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:51,950
been bred to be great producers,
producers meaning,

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,320
uh,
their offspring grow quickly.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,470
Uh,
they have good fat to meat ratio,

24
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,131
et Cetera,
et cetera.

25
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,320
Whatever the industry is looking for it.

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,470
That's the other white meat,
you know,

27
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:02,540
that's what,
that's where your other white meat is

28
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,530
coming from,
from,

29
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,700
from frozen semen.
I've a very select few bores.

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,280
Uh,
and so the natural way of course to do

31
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,200
it is to get a born a salad together.
And Sal,

32
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,410
when she's in heat and,
and,

33
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,130
and have them,
um,

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,400
have them work that way.
But,

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,760
but that's a hard thing to do.
It's a frustrating job because you've

36
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,620
got to get the sow when she's in heat in
the bore revved up and it's got to work

37
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,510
and you know,
there's some complications there.

38
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:27,440
So,
uh,

39
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,500
that's sort of old world farming.
Does it produce better flavor?

40
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:31,640
Well,
uh,

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,230
I would argue that it does,
but it would be a tough argument because

42
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,310
there are other people who would say,
well,

43
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:40,040
why wouldn't you get the super boards?
That's what they're bred for.

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,980
And,
and it's a no brainer when you're

45
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,990
educational facility.
That's part of the reason we do it.

46
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,350
We're an education facility,
so we're there to show how it's done.

47
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,360
Uh,
but I would argue that the flavor is

48
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:54,680
better because you can control your,
your,

49
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,710
your,
your future stock when you know your

50
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:58,401
bore.
Uh,

51
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,190
so you can choose your board,
you can choose your sow and you can

52
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,600
marry that together.
And you can,

53
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:05,120
through patients through time,
through generations,

54
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,120
increase the quality of your meat just
by getting to know your meat.

55
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,530
Uh,
and that's what we're there for.

56
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:12,020
And that's the exciting part about it.
When you buy off the Internet,

57
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,840
go to swine,
genetics.com you can get frozen semen

58
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,920
and you can,
uh,

59
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:17,390
you can use that,
but it,

60
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,090
but you really don't know what you're
getting and you don't know what your

61
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,400
introducing to your farm.
And so in this way,

62
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:26,180
you're in a closed system and it,
it seems to me to be a much more

63
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,330
interesting way.
And,

64
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,173
and,
and,

65
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,540
and for me,
flavorful way

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,993
arm for the future.

67
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,140
Yeah.
I mean,

68
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,060
you know,
the other white meat basically there,

69
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,710
they've gone in the other direction.
You know,

70
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,320
they've tried to work out any fat,
uh,

71
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,900
because basically in the seventies
chicken,

72
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,870
the chicken industry exploded a,
and it will,

73
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,400
you know,
was lean white meat,

74
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,740
uh,
and it took away,

75
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,840
directly impacted,
uh,

76
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,950
the pork industry.
So the pork industry launched this

77
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:00,120
enormous effort in the eighties.
A bring back sales.

78
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,290
I did it by,
by with a slogan,

79
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,810
the other white meat.
And that was basically to breed out the

80
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,980
fat,
uh,

81
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,480
and to,
uh,

82
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,150
get the other lean white meat,
which was cheaper and,

83
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,790
and,
and supposedly delicious and so,

84
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,341
so,
and,

85
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,400
and,
and more helpful for you and whatnot.

86
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:20,380
So we've lost a tremendous amount of,
of breeding knowledge of,

87
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,800
of,
of a stock of pigs that provide fat.

88
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,590
And when you,
when you have intermuscular fat and fat,

89
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,140
you have tons of flavor because the fat
carries the flavor.

90
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,680
Uh,
so what we're doing is breeding older

91
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,930
varieties of bigs that,
um,

92
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,840
that have a lot of flavor,
they grow slower,

93
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,120
uh,
and they're a little bit more difficult

94
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,180
to raise and you can't raise them in
this confinement factory facility.

95
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,300
So it's more expensive,
but it's much more delicious and it's

96
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,910
much better for the environment.
And there are studies that show that

97
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,350
it's much better for you.
So,

98
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,940
uh,
on all three.

99
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,810
But,
but you know,

100
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,680
the,
the trick,

101
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:55,560
it seems to me here with this,
with the stoma,

102
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,090
just looking at the overall gestalt of
this thing is like,

103
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,640
is that flavor is,
is the leader.

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,740
Um,
now if you had one of the farmers

105
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,590
sitting here,
he might argue and I think pretty

106
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,700
passionately that,
that,

107
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,820
well if you had the animal farm or he
probably argued passionately that it's

108
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,300
the humanity of the,
of the pig that thereafter.

109
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,200
So,
so that,

110
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,630
that the,
the best life for the pig is what his

111
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,600
goal is.
And the vegetable farmer probably say,

112
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,820
do I know in the vegetable farmer Jack,
you'd probably say something like,

113
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,900
you know,
it's the ecology,

114
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,150
it's about the environment.
You know,

115
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,410
it's about,
you want to,

116
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,130
to encourage all the floor on the fauna.
And it all relates,

117
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:34,510
it's one ecosystem and one mini
ecosystem and that's what you're after.

118
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,800
And food is important.
You know,

119
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,330
the,
the quality of the food is important in

120
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,240
there,
which are really great.

121
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,560
And,
and Craig with the humanities.

122
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,350
And so,
so me,

123
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,220
you know,
like,

124
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:44,080
uh,
my father always said like to a shoe

125
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,640
man,
uh,

126
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,960
you know,
there's nothing like leather,

127
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,040
right?
And so to me,

128
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:48,780
like to,
to,

129
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,800
to on this place,
like there's nothing like the best way

130
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,634
or food,
and I think,

131
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,140
I don't want to say I win in this,
but I think we all win because if you

132
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,350
lead with flavor,
if you lead with the flavor of the pork

133
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:04,150
or the carrot and you backtrack,
you're going to end up having to

134
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,280
practice the best ecological
stewardship.

135
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,120
You're going to have to have the best
biology in the soil,

136
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,230
uh,
the best nutrient density in the soil

137
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,680
because otherwise you don't get the
flavor for that pig.

138
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,480
You're going to have to do the best
breeding practices,

139
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:19,780
which are gonna lead to the best
ecological conditions for the pig and

140
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,580
the best humanity.
Uh,

141
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,730
so this idea that flavor and hedonism
and delicious food runs amok to

142
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,970
environmental stewardship and,
and,

143
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:37,030
and humane treatment of animals and even
economy,

144
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,781
even,
uh,

145
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,220
you know,
making money is,

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,650
it's a false choice.
It's the same thing.

147
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,950
And that's why,
you know,

148
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,080
I believe strongly that chefs,
you know,

149
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,800
chefs can lead this in the future
because our,

150
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,800
what our leather is good flavor.
It's hedonism.

151
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,350
And that's what we're talking about here
with all of this is,

152
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,290
is,
is hedonism.

153
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,780
And why the message,
it seems to me to be so strong for the

154
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,150
future,
why people are catching on because it's

155
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,640
not about,
it's not about sacrifice.

156
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,560
You know,
it's not about a religious kind of thing

157
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,890
where you have to give up something to,
to find a sense of fulfillment.

158
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:10,850
In fact,
it's the opposite.

159
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,851
It's you do more of the hedonistic,
pleasurable eating experience and you're

160
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,260
doing better.
Uh,

161
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,340
so if you're after the best flavor,
he just is axiomatic that,

162
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,750
that the best ecological practices,
environmental practices are going to be

163
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,370
in hand,
are not far behind.

164
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,020
And the most humane treatment of the
landscape and of the animals is not far

165
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,060
behind.
And also the best economy.

166
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,990
You know,
that it is a false assumption that that,

167
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,960
uh,
really flavorful food is expensive food.

168
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,940
It's not,
it's really not.

169
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,080
And,
and I,

170
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,910
we prove that it's stone barns every
day.

171
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,230
Uh,
you know,

172
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,060
the,
the cost of doing business and

173
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,360
agriculture is about distribution.
It is not about the actual adequate to

174
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,194
be actual growing.

175
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,230
If the farmers were the one getting rich
and our big food chain,

176
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,630
it'd be a whole different story.
If they're not,

177
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,630
they're struggling to get by.
It's the middlemen,

178
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,060
the men who are,
who are distributing to have the power

179
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:08,390
of distribution and the sellers in the
marketplace that make the money,

180
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:11,900
that value adds of the product or make
the money just in pure distribution and

181
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,210
economies of scale.
It's never about the,

182
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,340
the,
the number of,

183
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:18,530
of carrots that you can take out of the
ground per acre.

184
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,760
So,
so economy,

185
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,930
ecology,
flavor,

186
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,170
they're all one in the same.
And,

187
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,001
and it's,
I think that's a,

188
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:26,600
that's a powerful message for the future
because it's not about giving up

189
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,710
something,
it's about doing more of the same house.
