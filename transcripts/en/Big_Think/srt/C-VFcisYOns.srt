1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,700
First of all,
obviously when you're going to cut

2
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,590
costs,
start with data,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,560
which businesses are underperforming,
which product lines are underperforming,

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,310
which people are underperforming and you
know,

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,840
start there.
Uh,

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:25,740
what I think often happens is the
company's hope for some natural process

7
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,650
of attrition,
things start to get difficult.

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:32,970
They kind of take across the board cuts
and that's almost never a good idea.

9
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,090
I remember,
uh,

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,290
just recently I was having a
conversation with a cfo in a large

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,190
company and they had just kind of had
kind of a blanket policy that every

12
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,670
division,
every a national organization was going

13
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:48,120
to have to take down head count by 10%.
And I said,

14
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,410
like,
this is across the board.

15
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:51,000
No exceptions,
no exceptions.

16
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,470
Everybody has to do it.
It's a mandate.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,581
I said,
well,

18
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,490
surely that can't be a the right way to
do it.

19
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,330
I said,
uh,

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,220
you know,
you have divisions that have great

21
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,030
growth prospects.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,760
You have others that have gone fat and
Lazy,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,833
uh,
why,

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,830
you know,
why just do it across the board?

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,420
And he said,
because it's fair.

26
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:07,440
I said,
how is that fair?

27
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,274
I mean,
you know,

28
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,970
some,
some businesses are already lean,

29
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:12,030
so is it,
how can that possibly be fair?

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,260
He thought him and he said,
yeah,

31
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,820
you're right.
But it's easy.

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,510
Well,
easy is usually not a good criteria for

33
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,020
making a business decision.
So the,

34
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:22,770
the,
the starting approach for any kind of

35
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:27,771
smart cost cutting is really a very,
very careful analysis of what's grown

36
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:28,950
fat,
what's going lazy,

37
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,020
where do we have great prospects,
where do we don't?

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,720
But costs cutting should never be
uniform.

39
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,340
And across the board,
number one.

40
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,010
Number two I think is smart costs
cutting.

41
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,210
You spend a lot of time talking to
people about what's happening.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,700
You know,
clearly some people are going to have to

43
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,040
go.
And how do you avoid demoralizing all

44
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,930
the folks that are left?
Well,

45
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,480
first you have to be honest about what's
changing in the environment.

46
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,450
That's not too hard at the moment.
Most people get that we're in a very,

47
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,620
very deep recession.
But you also have to be kind of have a

48
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,810
due process and make sure that in the
heat of trying to uh,

49
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,630
bring your costs back in line,
you're not indiscriminate and how you

50
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,780
let people go,
that you're taking people one at a time,

51
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,450
you're really evaluating their
contribution.

52
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:18,080
They understand why it's they,
that person and not the person next door

53
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:22,580
to them that is being asked to leave.
And when you have to cut deep enough so

54
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:23,990
you feel that you're cutting,
you know,

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,430
not,
not kind of the slack,

56
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:27,480
not the beat team,
but you're cutting people out of the

57
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,423
team.

58
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,860
You also want to,
if you possibly can,

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,140
let people know that you're going to be
rehiring,

60
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:35,090
that you're going to want to reengage
them,

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,410
but do the whole process in a way where
you not destroyed their loyalty,

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,010
their emotional connection to the firm.
That means explaining why it's

63
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:44,570
happening.
Being sure that,

64
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,130
that they understand why it's,
you know,

65
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,840
why certain people,
not other people.

66
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,630
And if you can,
giving them at least the hope that

67
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,300
there's a rehire when the economy starts
to tick up.

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,030
Do all of those things.
And I think you can get through a lot of

69
00:02:56,031 --> 00:03:00,450
the costs cutting without an undermining
of the morale your company or without

70
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:04,150
finding that doof kind of cut off some
of the most valuable people that you've

71
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,870
eaten the seed card as it were
inadvertently in the midst of a crisis.

72
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,250
So I think you have to be very,
very careful in the way you do this and

73
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,370
you have to recognize that recessions
are temporary.

74
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,490
We've come out of everyone,
uh,

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,690
you know,
during our lifetimes we're going to come

76
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:24,570
out of this one.
And what do you often find is that the

77
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,510
companies that had to cut less deeply
that we're able to,

78
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,380
to kind of soldier through,
did not lose key resource is the not,

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,251
you know,
uh,

80
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:34,500
bring their key capital projects to
halt.

81
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,310
Those are the companies that gain market
share on the upturn.

82
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,520
Cause you know what,
it is really hard to rehire.

83
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,410
Lease great people,
talented people.

84
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,770
It takes a long time to find that or
bring them back on board again.

85
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,890
Make them productive.
It takes time to get those capital

86
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:53,910
projects underway again.
So if you can find ways of cutting less

87
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,070
deeply through the depths of the
recession,

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,100
you absolutely have an advantage coming
out of the recession.

89
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,520
Now it's also true that you know,
some companies over higher,

90
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,980
and I think this is usually kind of a
political thing.

91
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,020
You know,
in most organizations we measure

92
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:11,100
people's authority and kind of their
status by the size of their budget and

93
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:14,310
the size of their headcount.
So there's kind of an imperial listing

94
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,050
that people have.
They want bigger teams,

95
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:19,410
more people and so on.
And so you have to keep that in check.

96
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:19,911
You know,
you,

97
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:23,940
you have to keep constant attention on
to all of those key productivity

98
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,990
measures and make sure that at no point
as you grow to those things get

99
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,970
significantly out of whack.
Yes.

100
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,770
You know,
if you're in a fast growing market,

101
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,880
your fast growing company,
you have to hire a bit above,

102
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,671
uh,
you know,

103
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:36,480
the,
uh,

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,210
uh,
the demand curve because it takes a

105
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,620
while to bring people on board and get
them up to speed.

106
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,190
But you want to watch those ratios very,
very carefully.

107
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,830
Make sure that they never get out of
line,

108
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,590
that that,
that you at at every moment through the

109
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,850
down and the up curve that,
that,

110
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,680
that you are paying attention there.
If you stop paying attention for a

111
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:59,790
moment is very easily for people at all
levels of the organizations to pad their

112
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,850
teams with more people to hire a bit
indiscriminately.

113
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,970
And then you suddenly find out that,
uh,

114
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,380
when times are tough again,
you have a lot of slack and you're going

115
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,580
to have to put the organization to a lot
of trauma to get rid of that.

116
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,930
So be careful when you hire right?
Don't over hire,

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,280
but also be careful not to over cut
cause coming out of the recession.

118
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,890
The ones that have been able to maintain
kind of the,

119
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,120
the,
the employment status,

120
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:27,330
the capital programs,
they're going to be the quickest to ramp

121
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:30,920
up growth and grab the market as it
emerges as we come out of there.
