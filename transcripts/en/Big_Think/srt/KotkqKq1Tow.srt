1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
Hmm.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,750
Oh,
hi bill.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,410
My name is [inaudible].
My question is about giving some chance

4
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:10,570
to the chance.
Um,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,360
the power ability of winning a lottery
is very,

6
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,430
very small.
Nevertheless,

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,760
it's playing lottery rational.
Thanks.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,760
The lottery Uri,
Uri,

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
Uri,
I've got to tell you when I first I,

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:28,900
it doesn't sound like you're in the u s
I grew up in the u s and I lived in

11
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,600
Seattle,
Washington for a while now Washington in

12
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:36,010
the United States as a western state.
It has old traditions and the big thing

13
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:40,780
is it's not as populated as other states
in the u s and there was a lottery.

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,770
There is a lottery and they used to
think it was kind of charming and people

15
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:47,320
want to play the lottery.
Okay.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,090
Yeah,
that'll be fun for them.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,670
The chances of winning are very,
very small,

18
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:55,030
extraordinarily small,
almost everyone who ever plays ever

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,810
loses.
And he used to think it was benign or

20
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:01,420
not any big deal.
But I have changed my mind about that

21
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:06,421
over the last 30 years.
The lottery is mostly a tax on people

22
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,020
who don't know math.

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,090
And the reason they don't know math is
because people like me have failed to

24
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:16,120
enlighten people on what it really
means.

25
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:20,650
When it's one and 230 million,
it means you will lose.

26
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,650
That's what it means.
If you have a one in 230 million chance

27
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,240
of winning,
it means you will lose.

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,210
And uh,
when I was doing standup comedy,

29
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:33,211
I used to have a joke,
a joke about having a revolver,

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,820
a gun,
where the bullets are arranged in a

31
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:40,120
circle.
I don't know your ancestor Uri,

32
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:44,890
but you might be from uh,
one of the eastern bloc countries in

33
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:47,800
Europe.
And we have an expression in the United

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,910
States,
Russian roulette,

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,740
where there's one bullet in the gun and
you spin it and then you hold it to your

36
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:58,180
head and see whether or not you'll die.
And that's a one in six chance

37
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:01,150
traditionally.
But in the lottery it's one and 230

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,800
million or 450 million.

39
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,730
So imagine a gun with 449 million,
999,000,

40
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:15,841
999 bullets in it and one empty chamber.
You would not hold that to your head for

41
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:22,621
$2 ever.
And so I feel bad that uh,

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,010
the people who play the lottery are
generally people with lower education

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,210
and lower incomes.
This,

44
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:36,211
these are statistical facts.
So we are accidentally taxing people who

45
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,120
can least afford it.
And it's frustrating for me as a science

46
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,930
educator.
So,

47
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,810
uh,
my advice to you is don't play the

48
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:46,750
lottery.
Use your dollars for something else.

49
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,890
And if you do play the lottery a,
I understand you get some pleasure out

50
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:53,470
of it,
but keep in mind you almost always lose

51
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,550
and wait,
there's more to it that it preys on this

52
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:02,530
other aspect of nature where we embrace
the successes and forget about the

53
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,650
losses.
This is how psychics make their living

54
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,450
palm readers and so on that you remember
when they accidentally said the right

55
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,500
thing and you forget when they said
dozens of wrong things.

56
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,360
So people,
when they bet a dollar and they win a $5

57
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,910
lottery ticket,
$5 reward,

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,300
they almost always reinvest that $5 or
the $4 to buy more lottery tickets.

59
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,220
It's really,
it seems like a cool idea.

60
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,580
And now in the United States,
there's huge state incomes based on

61
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,850
lotteries,
but in the biggest sense,

62
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,310
it is a tax on the people who can least
afford it.

63
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,200
It's frustrating.
I'm frustrated.

64
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,600
Thank you for asking that question.
Eri.

65
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,490
Hmm.
