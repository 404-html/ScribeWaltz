1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,100
Global migration is a pervasive reality.
We have more migraines than ever in

2
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,420
history.
We even have more migrants as a

3
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:17,650
percentage of the world population.
Just creeping up to about three plus

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:22,210
percent of the world population are
people who live outside of their country

5
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:24,100
of origin,
their ex pats,

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,710
economic migrants,
whatever you want to call them,

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,980
and that's 3% of a much larger world
population than was the case in 1950

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,780
right?
We're approaching a world of seven and a

9
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:36,790
half,
8 billion people,

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,090
more than 3% of whom are now migrants,
so that's nearly 300 million people who

11
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:46,450
are living outside their country of
origin who may be temporary.

12
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:50,020
They may be permanent.
I believe that there's global migrant

13
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,340
horde,
if you will,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,030
is always chasing the supply chain,
always chasing jobs,

15
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:58,780
always chasing a better life,
always chasing good cities to live in

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,610
and in fact,
most places in the world are reducing

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,860
the barriers to entry for migrants.

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,000
In 2015 Europe led in 1 million
migrants,

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,520
right.
Particularly a political refugees from

20
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:15,700
the Middle East.
Now they're talking about some limited

21
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:20,701
migration controls from the Middle East
and within their own territories across

22
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:24,220
European borders.
This is a very limited process because

23
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:28,390
European countries are of course largely
open to each other and generally very

24
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:29,920
integrated.
Their supply chains,

25
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,410
their economies are very,
very interdependent.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,920
But even if Europe were to impose very
strict migration restrictions,

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,540
that does not tell us about the global
picture.

28
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,650
The same year,
2015 ozzy on the Association of

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,720
Southeast Asian Nations,
which is 10 countries and 700 million

30
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,180
people,
which is greater than the population of

31
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:56,020
Europe,
past an ozzy on Economic Community and

32
00:01:56,021 --> 00:02:01,021
ratified the treaty to allow the free
mobility of labor across it's countries.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,500
So even if in one year,
600 million people in Europe decided

34
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,900
that they want to limit mobility the
same year,

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,130
700 million people in Asia decided they
want to increase mobility.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,730
So only from a totally euro centric
standpoint,

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,170
our walls going up and migration becomes
more difficult.

38
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,680
That's not actually what is happening on
a worldwide basis.

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,110
In fact,
we're going into a period that I

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,280
described as a great demographic
dilution,

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,080
even a genetic dilution.
There is so much more intermingling of

42
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:39,370
different ethnic populations happening
around the world that there are very few

43
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:43,090
countries left that you could even
decide define as nation states.

44
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Traditionally,
we think of a nation state as a country

45
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:50,830
where 85 or 90% of the population
belongs to the same ethnic group.

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,360
The number of nation states is declining
because more and more countries are

47
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,330
becoming more ethnically diverse.
Even in Europe,

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,390
where the of the nation state really
began,

49
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,970
uh,
in the Middle Ages and into the modern

50
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,100
nation states of,
of,

51
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,740
of Western Europe.
Today there you see a growing percentage

52
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:12,940
of migrants and therefore those
countries are no longer even nation

53
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,010
states.
So in fact,

54
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:19,780
we have this genetic intermingling and
we see this particularly in global

55
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,781
cities that are melting pots,
places like Singapore or Hong Kong or

56
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
Dubai or Toronto or London,
places where the foreign born percentage

57
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:35,680
of the population,
maybe 40% 50% in the case of Dubai,

58
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,710
even 85 or 90% of the residents actually
don't come from that place.

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,200
And so we see literally mingling of
ethnicities mixed the birth children and

60
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,721
this mingling of populations that has
never taken place before at this rapid

61
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,500
rate.
So yes,

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
populism is a feature of our politics.
There is a backlash against immigration

63
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:03,841
to some degree in quite a few places,
but the global picture is one of more

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,660
mass migration and integration across
societies.

65
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,310
It is very important for us to not be
deterministic about geography and

66
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:17,170
instead to always take into account the
layer of connectivity on top of

67
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,290
geography and the impact that has.
In other words,

68
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,050
the relationship between political
geography,

69
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,150
which is our nations and boundaries and
political barriers and functional

70
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,850
geography,
which are the connections that we build

71
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,910
across those boundaries.
To understand the relationship between

72
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:36,820
any two countries,
you have to take into account not just

73
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:40,840
the political boundary,
but the infrastructural connectivity.

74
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,230
Then obvious example is the United
States and Mexico.

75
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,300
It may be the case hypothetically,
that one day if some particular person

76
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,950
were to become president of the United
States,

77
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,130
he may wish to erect some kind of a wall
on the border between the two countries,

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,150
which might have the impact of reducing
the inflow into America.

79
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,900
Have a very small number of illegal
migrants into the country.

80
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,200
Does that tell you everything you need
to know about us?

81
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,900
Mexico relations,
not by a long shot.

82
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,590
In fact,
u s Mexico relations consist of the

83
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:17,440
following.
It is one of the world's two or three

84
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,000
most heavily legally transited borders
with hundreds of thousands of people

85
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,360
moving across every single day.
It is one of the largest trade

86
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:27,730
relationships in the world with more
than a half,

87
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,150
a bit more than um,
several hundred billion dollars of

88
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:36,151
annual trade every single year.
It is a two countries that are massively

89
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:39,850
investing in each other's economies,
particularly in the United States now

90
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:43,780
investing more and more in the Mexican
energy supply in the Mexican energy

91
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,390
sector,
in the Mexican automotive sector,

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,880
and of course there is still very large
amounts of demographic and ideational

93
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:55,810
and communications and electronics flows
that are happening between the two

94
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,830
countries all the time.

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,290
That is u s Mexico relations.
Not whether or not there is a wall or

96
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:07,160
not a wall on the border.
So if you multiply that by every single

97
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,090
border in the world,
you start to understand that there is so

98
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,280
much more connectivity between
countries.

99
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,870
Then there is division and that's just
if we're talking about countries that

100
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:22,520
border each other,
but only 25% of world trade is between

101
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:27,521
countries that share a border.
75% of world trade is between countries

102
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,510
that are not physically connected to
each other at all.

103
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,410
There's obviously lots of connectivity
between all of our societies.

104
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,290
Otherwise,
how would 75% of our world trade be

105
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,570
taking place at all?
And in fact,

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,600
the value of world trade in services,
things that we zap rather than ship is

107
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,540
now more valuable than the trade in
goods,

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,120
things that we physically put in
containers and ship.

109
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,470
And so if you think about the full,
almost total digital connectivity that

110
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,460
is encompassing the world with the rapid
spread of mobile communications and the

111
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,730
Internet,
the more you realize that even if you

112
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:06,290
can't physically see the connectivity,
it is such an intimal intimate part of

113
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,070
our lives and our economy.
We know that throughout history,

114
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,250
the great thriving commercial and even
political centers of the world have been

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,750
open,
diverse,

116
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,430
tolerant,
melting pots.

117
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,120
Ancient Greece was like this.
The Roman empire was like this.

118
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,060
The Ottoman empire was a very diverse,
uh,

119
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,850
empire.
The great trading centers of European

120
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,410
history,
particularly Amsterdam.

121
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:34,130
We're very diverse and inclusive.
London during the British empire,

122
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:38,840
welcomed in people from all across the
Commonwealth and today the great global

123
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,840
cities of the world,
such as New York or Los Angeles,

124
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:46,841
or London or Dubai or Singapore,
or all very diverse cities in an age

125
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,361
where we pride cities on being thriving
and creative and innovative and having

126
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,330
services as a dominant part of their
economy.

127
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,870
Those sources of dynamism come from the
open to tall and being tolerant and open

128
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,990
to immigration.
So we find a real correlation between

129
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,870
the great cities in the world,
the desirable places to live,

130
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,590
and their openness to immigration and
talent and diversity.

131
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,300
And I think that's something to
celebrate.
