1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,950
Everything takes away.
I know very few geniuses,

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,830
very few,
if any,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,090
who can just show up and be brilliant.
The rest of us,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,070
we have to work hard there.
There is no magic potion.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,100
There is no secret sauce.
It's work and that's a lot of work.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,400
And not to be afraid of work,
but indulge in it.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,790
Take it,
be confident with it.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,193
Work hard.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,783
MMM.

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,330
There are certain things that um,
come and time,

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,480
you know,
and um,

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,070
experience is one of those things that
comes after time.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,760
You need the time,
but you can put yourself in a position

14
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:59,761
to gain experience by allowing yourself
to voluntarily be a beginner at

15
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,910
something.
Um,

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,010
I find that to be a very big character
trait,

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,910
very admirable character trait.
Um,

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,030
when someone purposefully puts them in
the selves in a position to be a

19
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:22,510
beginner.
So the CEO of a major corporation says,

20
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,130
you know what?
I don't know how to snowboard.

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,870
I'm going to go out there.
And this person,

22
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,930
man or woman who is a commander of a
legions of people perhaps is now on,

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,840
on the side of a mountain falling on his
or her ass and having a 16 year old kid

24
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,810
be the teacher.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,950
That's a fantastic position to put
yourself in.

26
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,580
And I think people should constantly
look for ways to voluntarily put

27
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:01,930
themselves in a position of not knowing,
of being vulnerable,

28
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,390
of saying,
I'm going to learn something here.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,300
I want to be open to this and admit I
don't know how to snowboard.

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,390
Please teach me and,
and have an experience and an empowering

31
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,690
a millennial,
a younger generation person to say,

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,750
you are my instructor.
You are my teacher,

33
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,290
please do it.
And it's like,

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,130
wow,
that's a beautiful thing for human

35
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:34,540
beings to share is to reach out and say,
no,

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,050
you're the boss.
Please show me the way.

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,830
Okay,

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,830
there's power and confidence.
I male on the other side of the the

39
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:49,210
table now a lot.
I produce and I direct and I,

40
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,610
right.
Um,

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,770
and I can really feel the difference
when someone comes into a room with

42
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,604
confidence.

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,900
Okay.

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,670
But I want to draw the distinction
between confidence and boastfulness.

45
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,570
Someone who is figuratively pounding
their chest saying how great they are.

46
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,890
That's not confidence.
To me,

47
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:16,891
that's it's egocentric behavior.
And that makes me push away someone who

48
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:24,250
boasts about how great they are.
I'm leery about that.

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,610
But there's a quiet confidence.
And what I tried to,

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
to express to millennials,
to younger generation of actors,

51
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,090
writers,
directors,

52
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:38,470
artists of any kind is to,
is to value your talent.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,110
And I would say to them,
I'd say,

54
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,240
are you talented?
And I hope you say yes.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,060
That's not a boast.
It's,

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,380
it's being honest.
Do you go out and tell everybody on the

57
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,191
street,
Hey,

58
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,660
I'm talented,
I'm really talented.

59
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,850
No,
it's for yourself.

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,440
It's,
it's,

61
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,190
it's internal.
And you can own that and you can value,

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,450
greatly value your own contributions to
something,

63
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,180
your intellect,
your imagination,

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,740
your humor,
whatever experience you have so far,

65
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,050
you're young,
you'll gain more experience.

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,840
That's great.
Be Confident in that.

67
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,450
Um,
when I sense confidence,

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,860
I want more from that person.
I,

69
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,050
I do the reaching and um,
I think that's a,

70
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:36,051
a great lesson.
I just came back from a Uso tour and

71
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,090
talking to only millennials and you
know,

72
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,450
millennials have been maligned a lot
thinking that,

73
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,530
you know,
you've been,

74
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,700
you've been given the the bullshit line
of,

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
Oh,
you just want the trophy.

76
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,890
You just want to show up and you'll get
a trophy.

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,020
You're not really willing to work for
it.

78
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,840
You're not,
and that I just don't buy into that.

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
Just don't listen to any of that.
Um,

80
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,310
I was so impressed with these young men
and women in the military,

81
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,410
in this case,
commanding great presence,

82
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,260
confidence,
nobility,

83
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,740
kindness.
My wife and I said,

84
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,100
I think we're going to be okay.
Truly.

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,180
It's like,
Oh,

86
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,910
if this is,
if this is the next generation of

87
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,050
leaders,
we're going to be okay.

88
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,030
We really are.
We're going to be fine.

89
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,200
Um,
you know,

90
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,880
I think every generation looks to the
next one and says,

91
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,170
oh,
they're not like us.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,590
We were better.
I know you guys are fine,

93
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,180
but there is,
there is definite value in work.

94
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,940
I knew that when I was starting out as
an actor,

95
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,160
I was all about work.
It was like,

96
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,360
and I still am.
I love it.

97
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,700
But that's the,
that's the key.

98
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,530
If,
if you find something that you love to

99
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:00,500
do,
then when Monday comes along,

100
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,110
you're not going Monday.
You're like,

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,180
Monday,
I get to act.

102
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,790
That was great for me.
I love Mondays.

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,450
I love Mondays.

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,950
Mm.
