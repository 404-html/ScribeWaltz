1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,770
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,580
I think that researchers themselves
could do a better job of trying to

3
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:16,940
explain to the public what it is we do.
So first of all,

4
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:19,310
I would like to say that we need to do
more of this.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,280
Um,
and I think that the public,

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,490
if we take the time to do that,
um,

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,390
will have different viewpoints.
Of course we're a heterogeneous and

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:30,050
diverse society,
but,

9
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:32,570
uh,
unless we do more of that,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,820
uh,
we can't say that the public has

11
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:37,430
misperceiving if we don't give them the
information to evaluate.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,943
Um,
I,

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,310
I think that,
uh,

14
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:45,311
there are many elements that we can
explain and speak less than a scientific

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,710
jargon.
Um,

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,840
uh,
and,

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,010
uh,
actually work a communication specialist

18
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,640
frankly,
to get messages out in different

19
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,380
languages and different,
uh,

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,580
different levels.
You know,

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,270
why not let fourth graders here about
what we're doing at the level of fourth

22
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,360
grader university students,
medical students,

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,380
medical professionals have different
ways of communicating with the

24
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:08,990
different,
uh,

25
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,880
constituents in society.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,860
There are many organizations now that,
um,

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,140
because the public votes with their,
their,

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,390
their checkbook,
in other words,

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,830
their taxes on the people they elect.
We have to go to the public,

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,440
uh,
and particularly around public private

31
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,460
partnerships,
uh,

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,740
that we want to build from the private
sector with,

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,770
with a,
a civil society and with the public

34
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,650
sector,
we need to be out and to say,

35
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:38,820
you know,
what it is,

36
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,500
you know,
what our core values are,

37
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,840
what our mission is,
what we can do to be part of the

38
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:45,150
solution,
not to take on the whole problem.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,580
Uh,
and to build these partnerships with the

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,593
public sector.

41
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,470
I am worried that,
uh,

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,130
there is mistrust between the public and
academia,

43
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,520
uh,
and uh,

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,610
with public entities as well,
but particularly with the pharmaceutical

45
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:05,990
industry.
Um,

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,860
so w we have many corrective actions
that we've taken.

47
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,500
We are trying to respond and get
feedback,

48
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,343
uh,
on,

49
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,160
on what type of activities we need to
improve ourselves on.

50
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,740
But I would like to see us on a much
more positive trajectory where it is

51
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:26,480
clear that what we are doing is
delivering what the public wants,

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,710
the diseases they want us to work on.
And the public has a lot of voices as

53
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,580
well.
So we can't satisfy all.

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,680
Um,
all of the needs,

55
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:34,514
but,
uh,

56
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,060
you know,
certainly we want to be a serving

57
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,770
medical need,
um,

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,370
in the way that public a regained some
competence in what we do.

59
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,320
I think that,
uh,

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,580
many of the issues that the public has
with Pharma,

61
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,710
we need to listen to and we need to
understand those,

62
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,930
what their issues are and we need to
have an internal dialogue with the,

63
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,420
about these things.
When that happens,

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,070
you know,
uh,

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,710
we need to negotiate a,
a path out of that.

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,170
So I think,
you know,

67
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,120
part of the district trust was around
transparency,

68
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,320
around data and publication,
that data and frankly the safety of our

69
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,460
medicines when we explain what the
safeguards that we do and the fact that

70
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,980
we're a very highly regulated industry
more so than,

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,040
than most industries.
And get out with what we're doing that

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,220
to show that we've heard what they've
said to us and then what are our plan

73
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,750
are and then to ask them,
is that what you had in mind about our,

74
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:35,080
our,
our corrective action.

75
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,980
The other thing we can do is just talk
about the great science we do.

76
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,610
Um,
about the lives that are affected by our

77
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:47,200
medicines and our vaccines,
about the programs that we build,

78
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,710
the disease elimination programs,
the health management programs around

79
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,750
our therapeutics,
because it's not just about the

80
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,610
molecule,
it's not just about the vaccine,

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,770
it's about the,
the disease management programs that we

82
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,771
build into this telling the story,
asking our customers are our

83
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,120
constituents,
you know,

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,030
how,
how are we doing a getting feedback

85
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,410
changing course.
Um,

86
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,460
and I,
I think that that,

87
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,623
so I,
you know,

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,630
I don't look at the public is having a
misperception of us.

89
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,801
Um,
I,

90
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,820
I look at,
uh,

91
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,510
our need to have more of a dialogue with
the public and to evolve science.

92
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,090
It's about evolution anyway.
So a scientist,

93
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,140
we should evolve with the public.

94
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,850
Personally,
I'd like to see progress in infectious

95
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,200
diseases because,
um,

96
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,050
uh,
you know,

97
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,750
we have A.
HIV is still a raging pandemic now.

98
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,720
Uh,
it's not thought about as much in the

99
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,970
developed world because,
uh,

100
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,860
in many Pharma and public private
partnerships working with the NIH and

101
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,190
other public entities,
we now have turned HIV in the developed

102
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:52,180
world into a chronic disease is very
treatable,

103
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,290
not with the best and not with optimal
medicine.

104
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:59,130
So we still have room to go,
but the largest part of the,

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,600
you know,
the,

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,380
the planet with HIV,
uh,

107
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,240
until recently you had no access and now
I'm a,

108
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,690
we were making great strides with the
Global Fund,

109
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,920
pepfar,
um,

110
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,940
other programs that originated out of a
Pharma to get into some of the issues

111
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,500
around access.
So,

112
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,821
but,
you know,

113
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,830
there are two to three,
four,

114
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,760
five,
um,

115
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,830
after HIV.
So Tuberculosis,

116
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,290
malaria,
acute respiratory infections in

117
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,390
children,
etc. Uh,

118
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,380
that,
uh,

119
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,690
uh,
really deserve as much attention I think

120
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,880
as hiv.
So I woUldn't want to say one thing,

121
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,280
I would say let's have a grander vision
and tackle the top 10,

122
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,570
at least the top 10.

123
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,640
Tacoma is a,
is a historical disease.

124
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,220
It's,
it's mentioned in the greek papaya ray,

125
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,280
and it's actually mentioned in the bible
and it was in the us,

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,530
uh,
in appalachian on indian reservations

127
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,420
after the battle of a denial when,
uh,

128
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,100
basically,
uh,

129
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,460
nelson sank the french fleet,
the returning navy and soldiers brought

130
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,310
tacoma to europe.
So this has been a disease in the

131
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,160
developed world,
but with improved sanitation,

132
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,230
uh,
the disease has gone away and actually

133
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,040
on the reservations with some mass
antibiotics.

134
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,790
So until the poverty agenda in the north
south divide is a really,

135
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,950
a solid tacoma is going to be a disease
that requires other modalities including

136
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,800
antibiotic treatment.
Uh,

137
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,020
but agaIn,
I believe that with the current

138
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,200
mobilization that,
that the disease is within reach,

139
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,880
tacoma is caused by a bacteria.
It's usually crowding and in poor

140
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:48,220
conditions and with repeated infections
of the eyes,

141
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,120
scarring occurs over many years.
That leads to blindness.

142
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,720
Um,
malaria is a mosquito transmitted

143
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,330
disease.
Um,

144
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,320
and uh,
actually again,

145
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,420
uh,
the south all the way up to Washington

146
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,420
and this country was a endemic from
malaria.

147
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,280
Um,
but,

148
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,700
uh,
today 90 percent of malaria and malaria

149
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:14,090
deaths are in subsaharan africa.
Um,

150
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,380
and,
uh,

151
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,200
again,
the parasites have the advantage because

152
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:22,970
of their sheer numbers and replication
that they become quickly resistant to

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,230
many of the available drugs.

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,630
I believe a tacoma tHat,
uh,

155
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,740
the global Illumination of tacoma is,
is within reach by the year 20,

156
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,080
20,
and that is our goals.

157
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,830
I'm going to the world health
organization,

158
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,530
uh,
tomorrow eVening to be part of that

159
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:41,240
annual meeting.
Um,

160
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,860
that program iS being linked with other
neglected tropIcal disease programs that

161
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,450
again,
uh,

162
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,250
many people in the field have been
working on it.

163
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:52,880
But for about fifty cents a year,
uh,

164
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:56,570
with four or five already approved
medicines,

165
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,020
we can look at eight or nine neglected
tropical diseases and imagine and

166
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:06,800
actually set metrics around elimination
that's different from diseases like

167
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,760
malaria where frankly resistances as
some of the,

168
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,200
the biggest concern.
And we really do need a full pipeline

169
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,320
from early discovery to a full
development to address the continuing

170
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,050
evolution of resistance.
The parasites of the advantage.

171
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,600
Um,
there will always be a need for new

172
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:31,260
therapeutics until we eliminate malaria.
But I don't see elimination as a,

173
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,390
as a,
as a real viable strategy for malaria

174
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,243
right now.

175
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,530
Very often these are a bacteria,
vIruses,

176
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:46,871
or parasites that were formerly a
completely susceptible to a therapeutic.

177
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,590
Many people don't.
so one such a bacteria is mrs.

178
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:56,130
Say,
and people hear about it in the news,

179
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,020
which is methicillin resistant staph
aureus,

180
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,500
when fleming first discovered
penicillin,

181
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,870
penicillin would treat staph aureus that
didn't last very long.

182
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,680
Other agents have been synthesized,
including different penicillins,

183
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,800
completely new classes of agents.
Um,

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,250
and I would say now that staph aureus is
pretty well served,

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,640
so what I would expect would be there'll
be a lack of a further discovery and

186
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:27,570
development for staff laureus.
And maybe in a period of time,

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,610
five years,
10 years or 15 years,

188
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,180
we'll be back to the problem of not
having agents with staph aureus.

189
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,130
Um,
right now,

190
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,290
uh,
we have gram negative organisms.

191
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,100
So these are bacteria that are found in
water supplies,

192
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:44,040
especially in hospitals because of the
antibiotic pressure.

193
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,950
There were a,
again,

194
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,350
if you were to get infected with one of
these organisms,

195
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:53,640
there may not be a therapeutic that will
help any effect against those organisms.

196
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,190
These are the super resistant bugs that
you asked about

197
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,370
in New York city just to make the case
locally in the late eighties,

198
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:03,730
early nineties,
um,

199
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,820
uh,
there was relaxed control of

200
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:10,821
tuberculosis and so that patients would
be admitted with tuberculosis hospital

201
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,290
for isolation and therapy,
um,

202
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,080
after two weeks would feel better,
but they need six more months of

203
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,430
therapy.
It will be sent out.

204
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,930
They would often get disorganized
because they were from the inner cities

205
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,010
are actually had a mental illness,
uh,

206
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:28,200
and this would happen three or four
times until they develop multidrug

207
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:31,230
resistant tuberculosis.
And in The layman's jargon,

208
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,240
a super resistant bug,
um,

209
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,890
and this was frightening.
Um,

210
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,500
this situation is now playing out in
places like South Africa where they have

211
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:43,140
something called an xdr,
a tuberculosis.

212
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,000
and so I know I had many patients,
I had many,

213
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,110
and these epidemics,
we'd have outbursts and in clinics and

214
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,210
hospitals.
So I knew health care providers that

215
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:57,190
were infected and got sick.
Um,

216
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,200
sometimes both the patients and the
healthcare providers were hiv positive

217
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,460
that seemed to promote actually the
aggressiveness of the bacteria

218
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:07,080
progressing,
um,

219
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,280
in the,
in these patients.

220
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,590
So It was quite a frightening situation.

221
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,380
One of the good things about
international travel now is that people

222
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:22,320
are more aware of cultures and
environments because they're traveling

223
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:25,860
on business to,
to emerging markets and frankly,

224
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,290
even some of the less developed
countries,

225
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,320
uh,
so I think they're in general is a,

226
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,700
uh,
what globalization has brought as a more

227
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,190
awareness of the,
some of the inequities,

228
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:38,640
not just with poverty be with diseases.
And uh,

229
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:39,271
you know,
I,

230
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:44,271
I hope with some of the economic trouble
in the developed world that we don't

231
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:48,270
lose sight of the fact that in the
developinG world they are suffering much

232
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:50,190
worse than we are.
Um,

233
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,630
so that,
uh,

234
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,890
you know,
we have an obligation in the develoPed

235
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:54,920
world,
uh,

236
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,450
to not lose focus on international
development issues.

237
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,480
In the seventies when a nixon announced
the war on cancer,

238
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,750
um,
budgets were decreased for infectious

239
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:10,340
diseases.
And this has been well published and

240
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,320
talked about in both the scientific and
the,

241
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:14,510
in the lay press.
Um,

242
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,520
and look what happened.
Hiv,

243
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,840
multidRug resistant tuberculosis.
I'm a west nile virus.

244
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,290
I think we've responded now what we,
we can't do is relax our,

245
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,980
a surveillance for emerging diseases,
our laboratory capabilities to study

246
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:36,410
these organisms and then to scale up to
have useful either therapeutics or

247
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:41,320
vaccines
when sars hit and then people would

248
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,660
probably prefer forgotten about it was,
it was terrifying what,

249
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,140
what happened?
And it was a,

250
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,450
a,
a,

251
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,570
like an influenza type of illness.
Um,

252
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
and uh,
you know,

253
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,230
the company I work for actually
synthesize 65 compounds in less than a

254
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,011
year,
uh,

255
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,440
in,
in a very much of a manhattan project

256
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,510
like environment,
um,

257
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,160
to then the disease went away
inexplicably.

258
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,680
Um,
so I think that capability to quickly

259
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:12,410
respond.
Um,

260
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,800
and also,
you know,

261
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm,
I'm a firm believer in science evolving,

262
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,390
um,
in new technologies becoming available.

263
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:21,960
So when it be nice and actually we are
working on this technology to have a

264
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:26,961
vaccine response that takes weeks and
not nearly a year and in some cases,

265
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,830
um,
and so there are,

266
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,710
there are approaches and we are working
in that field as well.

267
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,140
Um,
so it's about having existing

268
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,370
capabilities,
uh,

269
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:38,250
and not relaxed in the guard,
Both on surveillance of new diseases,

270
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,020
but also they built the ability to
respond.
