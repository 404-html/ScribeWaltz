1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,100
The economy is in bad shape and it's
gonna stay in bad shape for a while.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,060
He kind of feeds on itself.
There are fewer jobs over whether a few

3
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:13,480
people will spending money.
Therefore everybody's reach retracting

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,940
and,
and then this is a smaller profit.

5
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:21,950
So they let people go at it.
He goes on and on until finally somebody

6
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,800
like Roosevelt comes along and says,
you got nothing to fear but fear itself.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,570
And then fortunately he was a World War
II came along and I read a basic

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,400
recovery of the business.
Well,

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,940
I don't think that I wanted a world war,
uh,

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,120
to rejuvenate our economy.
So we're going to have to learn to do it

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,861
ourselves.
Now,

12
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,450
fortunately,
uh,

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,360
we're in a,
in a very global world and you know,

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,130
I already nixed,
takes one engine,

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,010
uh,
to get the thing going again this time

16
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,700
the engine will probably be,
uh,

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,550
the Far East,
China and India.

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,850
But you know,
we also have to learn how to police

19
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,740
ourselves.
We have to say,

20
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,000
no,
that's not the right thing to do.

21
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,510
I'm not going to do it.
And until the majority of businessmen

22
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:05,960
are the big majority,
bismuth say that we're still going to

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,690
have the same sort of problems we have
recurring.
