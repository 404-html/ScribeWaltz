00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,330
Green for all is a national
organization.

2
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:16,980
We're dedicated to creating green collar
jobs.

3
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,830
Those are jobs in the solar industry,
wind industry,

4
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,070
clean energy,
overall green construction,

5
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,440
organic food,
water conservation,

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,330
uh,
those green collar jobs,

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,660
getting them to low income people,
disadvantage people,

8
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,220
people of color.
Uh,

9
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:35,790
we want to fight pollution and poverty
at the same time by making sure that

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,791
this green wave that's coming is strong
enough and inclusive enough to lift all

11
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,100
boats.
