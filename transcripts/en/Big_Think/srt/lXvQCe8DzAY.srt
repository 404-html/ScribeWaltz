1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,840
I think a system like hello health could
definitely encourage more people to go

2
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,570
into primary cabs.
So however,

3
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:18,730
you know,
for the past at least 10 years,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,640
about 5% of doctors have been going into
primary care.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,640
Um,
most high performing health care systems

6
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,000
in the world,
uh,

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,140
have about 75% primary care doctors in
25% specialists and America.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,520
Um,
whereabouts exactly opposite.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,300
Uh,
we have 75% specialists and we're about

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,940
two generations of doctors behind the
curve on this one.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,500
So,
um,

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,350
it,
once boomers retire or die,

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,380
uh,
primary care sort of dead with them.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,890
Um,
which is unfortunate because that's

15
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,970
what,
you know,

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,410
that's what sort of controls your
experience and your health.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,970
Um,
that's the person that you should be

18
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,840
able to depend on.
Um,

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,480
but right now,
I mean,

20
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,430
specialists are making double,
triple,

21
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,960
quadruple,
uh,

22
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,360
as much as,
as primary care doctors.

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,010
So,
you know,

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,020
and seeing like half as many patients.
So what's the incentive for doctors to

25
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,120
go into primary care?
Um,

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,280
there's not much,
uh,

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,350
hello health,
a system like hello health,

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,140
uh,
that encourages and pays primary care

29
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,530
doctors for communication.
And pays them more on par with,

30
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,730
with,
um,

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,300
specialists would absolutely I think
work.

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,400
Uh,
then there are other issues where,

33
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:37,150
you know,
the medical sort of institutions devalue

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,373
the,
uh,

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,100
art talent of primary care in exchange
for,

36
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,500
you know,
the big bad neurosurgeon,

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,380
um,
respect they get.

38
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,700
Um,
I don't know,

39
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,730
that's going to be really interesting.
I mean that's the kind of stuff I'm sort

40
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,760
of thinking about right now.
Um,

41
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,860
what I think is most interesting about
the death of primary care and the con

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,040
and this then the rise of the Internet
as well.

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
Um,
when you think about it,

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,230
um,
the Internet connecting me with

45
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,280
information and connecting me with
patients is actually doing something

46
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,230
really,
really interesting to,

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,000
uh,
the practice of medicine.

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,540
Um,
you spend about one hour a year with

49
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,541
doctors and about 8,000,
765 without doctors.

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,640
So what does that mean to your life?
Well,

51
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,980
doctors aren't the cure all for your
health.

52
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,570
I mean,
you are right.

53
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,404
So,
I mean,

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,770
you're sort of like the CEO of your own
body and your doctor is a sort of a

55
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,720
consultant,
you call it every once in a while,

56
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:42,554
right?

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,780
So that basically means,
um,

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,590
there are a ton of tools that are just
now springing up,

59
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,320
uh,
that connect us with good information

60
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,670
that's relevant to you as well as
connect us with other patients who are

61
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:58,670
having similar problems as you.
So,

62
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,450
um,
I hope that the Internet can prevent,

63
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,530
uh,
office visits,

64
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,670
especially primary care visits,
uh,

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,050
and help people take care of themselves
better is tools.

66
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,130
Now,
um,

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,770
you know,
you can connect with doctors via video

68
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,160
chat.
Uh,

69
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,170
I think those tools have serious issues
there because nobody really uses video

70
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:21,550
chat with strangers and who are the
doctors that are on video chat where

71
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,890
they're seeing patients in our office,
you know.

72
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,480
Um,
but I think that there are opportunities

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,830
to build so to systems like this,
the issue is how do you,

74
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,610
when people need a prescription maybe,
um,

75
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,860
for say antibiotics,
uh,

76
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,880
and I can't really be done over the
Internet,

77
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,700
uh,
with today's sort of laws and

78
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,420
regulations.
