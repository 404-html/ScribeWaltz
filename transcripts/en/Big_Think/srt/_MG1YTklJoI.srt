1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,543
No

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,300
world of acquiring work for an auction
catalog is,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,620
it's quite hilarious because it's,
it's definitely this insane high,

4
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:21,621
low aspect to everything that we do
because on one hand there is very much

5
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:27,090
that kind of populist,
I'm making somebody rich overnight

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,380
appeal to putting together an auction,
which is very addictive.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,440
Um,
there's nothing greater than,

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,470
you know,
when the proverbial elderly lady in Rock

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,630
Chester writes you and says,
you know,

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,990
I saw you on some,
you know,

11
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,190
Internet site.
It sounds like you're,

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,330
I have this piece of furniture.
Is this by,

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,430
you know,
Carla Molino,

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,010
my,
my,

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,010
my,
my parents acquired it at a department

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,960
store and 1938 in New York.
And it is,

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,480
and it's,
so there's that aspect.

18
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,560
We have a one off relationship with the,
with the,

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,400
the client that pulls the declaration of
independence out of their basement.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,860
At the other time you have longterm
relationships with pickers.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,540
The guys in vans who'd go out there and
find the stuff that people are not savvy

22
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,390
enough to call us about the stuff that
goes through a state sales,

23
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,700
the stuff that ends up in foreclosure
auctions.

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,250
The things that get put left out by the
side of the road.

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,620
If you don't have a good network of,
of,

26
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,280
of dudes and vans in the postwar design
business,

27
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,280
you're finished.
And you've got to maintain excellent

28
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:38,430
relationships with them so that they
bring the peace to you and not to your

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,260
competitors.
But on the other side,

30
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:42,460
the high side of the coin,
um,

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,620
there's nothing more exciting than
meeting with curators in a museum who've

32
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,380
decided to deaccession apiece,
who've decided that,

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,910
um,
you know,

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,060
this piece isn't right for their
collection and they would like to sell

35
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,330
that piece to bring more money into
create,

36
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:58,164
get more pieces.

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,720
Um,
in December we sold a grand piano by

38
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,180
Gilbert Rhodey from the Museum of Modern
Art's collection.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,540
And the piano had been in their
auditorium and was being used by the

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,250
Department of film to accompany silent
movies.

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,830
But as a piece,
it's a piano.

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,860
And even though this was an extremely
rare piece by a very unsung 1930s

43
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,960
American industrial designer,
it's a piano and piano is very,

44
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:28,410
very hard thing for a museum to display.
So they sold it with us.

45
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,870
And you know,
nothing more exciting than,

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,040
you know,
having that kind of provenance.

47
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,691
You know,
when,

48
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,070
when,
when putting together a catalog and,

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,430
and finally we were working with,
you know,

50
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,360
I continue to work with some of the
great collectors out there and with

51
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,290
them,
well,

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,650
they already know much more than I do in
many of these areas.

53
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:48,420
It's more a question of meeting with
them and going,

54
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,430
well,
you know,

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,820
what do you want to do now?
What you know,

56
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,410
you want to sell right?
