1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,580
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,540
double take magazine once printed a
little pamphlet,

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,660
which I listed 10 different things that
you should,

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,820
you should do.
I can't remember all of them,

5
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,790
but the first one was turned off the
television set.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,490
I don't think you can,
you can read poetry while you're

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:28,491
watching television very well.
The idea of how to read a poem is based

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,570
on the idea that,
uh,

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,360
that poetry needs you as a reader,
that the experience of poetry,

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,320
meaning and poetry is a kind of circuit
that takes place between a poet,

11
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:47,040
a poem and a reader,
and that meaning doesn't exist,

12
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:51,690
or inherent poems alone that readers
bring their own experiences,

13
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:56,010
their own range of their own wisdom,
their own knowledge,

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,270
their own insights to poems and the
meaning of a poem takes place in the

15
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,330
negotiation between the poet,
the poem and the reader.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,550
And then as a reader,
you have a task to do.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,340
You have something to do.
You bring your experience to it.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,580
It's not all inherent in the poem.
Um,

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,200
the great Holocaust post-holocaust poet
Paul Salon,

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,850
said that a poem is a message in a
bottle sent out in the not always

21
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:25,851
greatly hopeful belief that somewhere
and sometime it would wash up on land on

22
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,240
heartland.
Perhaps the idea of a poem is a message

23
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:33,360
in a bottle means that it's sent out
towards some future reader.

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,940
And the reader who opens that bottle
becomes the address.

25
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,840
See of the literary Text Salon was
picking up something that the Russian

26
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,620
poet Osap Manuel Stem had written in
1916 called on the address.

27
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,350
See.
And Mondo stomp says a poet,

28
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,440
you go down to the shore and you see an
unlikely looking from a bottle from the

29
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,970
past.
You open it,

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,680
model stem says it's okay to do so.
I'm not reading someone else's mail.

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,410
It was addressed to ever found it.
I found it,

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,310
therefore it's addressed to me and that
when you find it,

33
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,820
you become the secret address.
See of a literary text.

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,340
And I felt that,
um,

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,500
the reader had been left out of this
experience of reading poetry or what

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,940
rate or what the experience of poetry
was.

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,360
And so my focus is on the reader and
that the poets job is not to inspire

38
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,130
himself or herself.
The Post job is to inspire some future

39
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,200
reader.
And so as a reader,

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,000
you have a task to do in finding those
bottles and opening up the messages and

41
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,730
experiencing what's in them inside of
yourself.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,620
I think that's a connection that you can
only hope for.

43
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:46,650
It's not something that you can make
because it does,

44
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,580
you know,
it needs someone else.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,730
Um,
I find in,

46
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,270
in Walt Whitman and an American
tradition,

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,990
a certain kind of,
I would say desperate American

48
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,730
in which you reach out
in which the poet tries to reach out

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,660
through the page to make a connection by
the side of the road with some other

50
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,660
person.
But ultimately that's,

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,290
that's a longing,
not a completion that has to be made by

52
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,560
other readers.
You can see clarity,

53
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,870
you can seek warmth,
you can try to make something for

54
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,960
lasting.
You can pick something in salt so that

55
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,470
it's well made and you can hope that it
out last time.

56
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,310
But ultimately that's not up to you.
Ultimately,

57
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:40,690
you're trying to reach across and find
some other person,

58
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,300
some other human warmth,
but it is,

59
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:47,710
especially in written poetry.
It is inscribed and attacks and the text

60
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:51,010
can't do that.
Work by itself and you as a poet can

61
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,840
only do your best.
