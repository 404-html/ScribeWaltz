1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,060
No,
I don't,

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,720
I,
my grandmother was a terrible cook,

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,643
uh,
and,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,920
and my mother died when I was very young
and my father was a terrible cook,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,990
so I think,
you know,

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,841
uh,
they,

7
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:20,170
I overcompensate a little bit like for
the cooking end of things.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,770
So I don't know why,
I don't know what drove me to,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,960
to be a chef exactly.
But the kind of chef that I've become,

10
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:29,770
I think was,
you know,

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,770
sort of unconsciously inculcated by this
connection to the land,

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,450
especially to like my grandma's sense of
responsibility,

13
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:38,680
which was huge.
It was like,

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,440
it was like she,
she very much believed in open space

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
and,
and in doing everything possible to

16
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,060
preserve it.
And that meant farming in the case of

17
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:51,350
where Blue Hill wasn't meant to preserve
that the pastoral,

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,010
you literally needed to pasture.
Uh,

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,560
and so,
you know,

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,570
there was a responsibility came attached
to the pleasure of the views literally.

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,970
Um,
and I think somehow I have connected

22
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:06,760
that with food and the idea that,
you know,

23
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,550
have those views and that open space,
you've got to eat it.

24
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,590
Uh,
so,

25
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,061
you know,
it's,

26
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,720
it's,
it's chef and it's,

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,060
you know,
it's being a chef and,

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,480
and providing pleasure by way of a kind
of responsibility that's um,

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,460
yes,
that's pleasurable in and of itself.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,900
I graduated and I was a little bit lost
on what to do and I went out and I baked

31
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:36,320
bread in California for awhile and kind
of cooked on the side,

32
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:39,710
just starting some money and I thought
actually maybe I'd write about,

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,570
I was going to write about a bunch of
things,

34
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:45,800
but I ended up just earning extra money
by cooking and that led one thing led to

35
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,370
another and I,
you know,

36
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:52,100
I was always kind of undecided until I
think I went to France and then I was

37
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:56,330
really cooking and that was sort of a
light went off I think,

38
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:57,720
although it was an Aha moment,
you know,

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,200
it wasn't one of those things I just
like,

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm still questioning as we sit here
now.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah.
