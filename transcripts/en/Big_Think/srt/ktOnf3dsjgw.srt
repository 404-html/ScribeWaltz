1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,580
Variety choice at,
at,

2
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,660
you know,
one of the things that we're growing are

3
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,540
basically dependent on what will grow
well in,

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,760
in our ecosystem again.
So,

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,511
uh,
you know,

6
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:25,070
we're basically getting seeds that
either are from the same latitude around

7
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,700
the world or from seeds that we know
have grown here in the past.

8
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:29,031
I mean,
we're,

9
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:33,010
right now we're growing a type of corn,
uh,

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,913
called,
uh,

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,040
eight row flint corn now,
eight row flint corn.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,300
Uh,
we did an experiment,

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,760
some guy,
crazy guy from North Carolina who's

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,400
obsessed with saving seeds,
paid us a,

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
paid our farmer Jack $2,000 to plant it
was 75 of these,

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,510
these corn corn plants of eight row
flint corn.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,480
He said,
now it was a,

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,720
it was the most popular corn,
uh,

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,530
among the native American Indians.
And they used to prize it for its

20
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:06,890
ability to dry and feed a feed the
tribes during the,

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,113
during the winter.

22
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,250
And so jack and I was very skeptical
that this would germinate at all.

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,230
Um,
and in fact,

24
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:20,230
we got 99 percent germination and we got
incredible corn now we harvested it.

25
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:21,470
And just like,
this is out of,

26
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:23,810
you know,
like if you write this into a novel,

27
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:25,640
you would think like,
this is just not to be believed,

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,660
but we harvest the next day,
the next day I'm reading this,

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
this,
this brochure from a very famous,

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,100
um,
uh,

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,030
marketplace and actually Michigan that
sells wholesale and retail around the

32
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,760
country.
And I opened up to like the middle of

33
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:41,740
the,
the pamphlet and,

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,340
and they say,
oh,

35
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,430
the most famous Italian placenta,
we now have it on sale oto feel a from

36
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:54,140
Italy and Oto feel a translate is eight
row flint corn.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,500
So it's the Italians that recognized
from the Indians this incredible core

38
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:04,250
and that could make this unbelievable
polenta took it from us,

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,940
preserved it while we in the United
States have completely lost that except

40
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,360
really for the seeds that we had growing
that ended up Germany.

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
I mean there's,
there's a little.

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,540
He paid some other farmers to grow and
they didn't really germinate well,

43
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,890
but we are preserving what is our
natural heritage in our natural ecology.

44
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,510
I mean,
this is where I was going to ne was

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,040
what's corn country?
You know,

46
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,370
for the native Indians,
and so the Italians recognize this,

47
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,110
you know,
hundreds and hundreds of years ago and

48
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,300
have preserved it over these small
family farms.

49
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,410
Um,
so it's,

50
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,410
you know,
it's one of those things.

51
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,740
So,
so now we grind our own Polenta,

52
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:35,300
you know,
it's like back into the turn of the

53
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:35,840
century,
you know,

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,530
we're,
we're like a well Miller and we grind

55
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:40,490
our own plant.
Do we make this unbelievably flavorful?

56
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,460
Belie that people cannot taste it and
they like,

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,370
they've never tasted polenta and their
life,

58
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,050
you know,
when they have this stuff now,

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,140
now it's really great point that there's
no question I gave you a ball right now.

60
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,970
You would flip out.
It's so good because you're really

61
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,700
tasting things that have been hybridized
out of it.

62
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,210
Uh,
you know,

63
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,610
flavors and oils and the,
in the German,

64
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,260
all that stuff are incredible.
But also by the way,

65
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,280
it's more helpful.
That's another thing.

66
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,340
Our research is that,
that in that germ,

67
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:08,830
in that oils are a lot of micronutrients
that totally brought out over the course

68
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,730
of,
of generations.

69
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,850
But,
but I tell that story about this wacky

70
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,840
dude at Beta $2,000 and the native
Americans and autofill April flicker,

71
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,890
and the response in the dining room is
as if you've just given them,

72
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,510
you know,
the secret to life,

73
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,640
right?
Because they're tasting now all of a

74
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,271
sudden,
you know,

75
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:30,271
I mean they're tasting Italy and,
and tradition and all this stuff that,

76
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,530
and,
and the tradition of Italy is based

77
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,810
actually on America.
This is like all the things that just

78
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,000
like totally drank the koolaid right
away,

79
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,650
you know.
So it's great.

80
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,920
Polenta is no question,
but it's much better because I have that

81
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,090
story that we can relate to everybody
and that makes me look like a better

82
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,900
chef.
You know,

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,750
even in my best days,
I don't lack an ego.

84
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,580
I'm not having an ego like the rest of
the chefs,

85
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,120
but I,
the,

86
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,670
I cannot cook as well as those stories
can make people taste things they

87
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,790
otherwise wouldn't taste the seasoning.
That's just priceless.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,870
So I like to get more of those stories
in self interest because it makes my

89
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,350
food taste.

90
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,220
Yeah.
