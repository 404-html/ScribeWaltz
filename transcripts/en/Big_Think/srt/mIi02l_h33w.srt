1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Yeah,

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,790
when I was in the Congress,
I would have dinner every night because

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,050
I didn't have a family and uh,
there were other members of Congress who

4
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:27,040
didn't have their families there and we
went out and had dinner.

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,750
Today I'm told it's a rarity to have
people who are of a different parties

6
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:39,820
that is to say Democrats having dinner
with Republicans and vice versa.

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,590
And that's bad.
That's very,

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,990
very bad for me.
It's the idea that politics have taken

9
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:49,750
such hold that it bars,
friendships.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,390
It's worse today than it was then.
And the reason is very simple.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,960
We were then the only city asking for
special help that I can recall from the

12
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,490
congress,
uh,

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,190
from the state legislature.
Whereas today,

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,010
almost every city in America has the
financial problems that we do on a

15
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:21,030
lesser scale or something,
be on a higher scale.

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,330
So I believe that the current mayor,
Mike Bloomberg,

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,370
was doing a magnificent job as problems
that were greater than mine.
