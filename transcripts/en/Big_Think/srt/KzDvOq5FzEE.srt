1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,720
Well,
I understand that the New York fed is at

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:17,721
the vortex of all the regulation that is
supposed to occur with respect to banks.

3
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:24,411
The New York Fed is the least node,
but most important regulatory body out

4
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,430
there.
It oversees all the financial

5
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,540
institutions,
controls,

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,930
access to borrowing for these
institutions and actually has,

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,850
has individuals from the New York fed
present at each of the bags so it can

8
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:40,851
see and hear and feel what's going on in
the marketplace and yet it failed abject

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,830
late to see what was going on in terms
of leverage,

10
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,420
in terms of risk exposure,
et cetera.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,790
Now this is all while Tim Geithner was
president of the New York fed and Tim

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,620
Geithner said when he was being
confirmed for treasury secretary,

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,560
he had never been a regulator,
which should have been not just a flare,

14
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:59,400
it should have been an exploding missile
saying this guy didn't understand his

15
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,700
job and I think he has failed as
treasury secretary is a consequence.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,730
Put that aside for a moment.
The Aig Tobacco and the bailout of Aig,

17
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:14,280
where $180 billion of tax money was
funneled through Aig.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,450
Much of it then being passed through aig
to the counter parties.

19
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:23,451
Everybody from Goldman Sachs on down or
given 100 cents on the dollar on credit

20
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,830
default swaps they had bought from Aig
for no apparent reason.

21
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:32,790
Goldman was given a check for 12 point
$9 billion,

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,160
which is parenthetically just about
precisely the profit they booked last

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,890
year.
Calendar Year Oh nine so the entirety of

24
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,640
Goldman's profit you can think of as a
tax payer and fusion.

25
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,790
Why did we give that to them now?
Geitner and blankfein would say because

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,020
we were owed oded,
why?

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,450
No,
there's what possible reason was there

28
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,700
for taxpayers to give Goldman Sachs that
money.

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,670
I want to see what their conversation
was back and forth.

30
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,000
Would Goldman have failed absent that in
fusion?

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,810
Did we negotiate with Goldman in return
and get stock,

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,600
get warrants?
Did we negotiate the amount of the

33
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,280
payment?
Why a hundred cents on the dollar?

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,120
All sorts of other people have been
taken huge financial hits.

35
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:18,330
Why did Goldman get paid off?
There are many,

36
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:23,331
many areas of inquiry that would be
exposed and would be explained if we

37
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:29,151
could break through and see aig is
emails radiating out into the regulatory

38
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,140
and financial sector.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,180
Let me make it clear.
I don't think Tim Geitner is a bad

40
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,520
person by any stretch of the imagination
as he's,

41
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,740
he's not corrupt.
He's not taking bags of cash.

42
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:44,310
He's,
he's not morally in any way suspect.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,930
He's just wrong.
And as I say,

44
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,270
there's no crime in being wrong.
We are all wrong,

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,760
uh,
at one point or another in varying

46
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,490
degrees.
And I'm certainly in that category as

47
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,290
well,
is as everybody knows.

48
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,410
And so he was wrong.
And so when I say he failed his treasury

49
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,580
secretary,
it has failed as treasury secretary and

50
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,510
is president of the New York Fed.
It's because he did not bring the right

51
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:09,511
set of principles and an understanding
of what his regulatory role was supposed

52
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,570
to be.
He embraced the Alan Greenspan worldview

53
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,830
of let them do what they want because
the marketplace,

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,330
somehow we'll provide a magic answer.
And that I think is the intellectual

55
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,880
error that,
that he has committed along with Larry

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,830
Summers and again,
extraordinarily smart,

57
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,680
brilliant individual but just wrong.
And you know,

58
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,200
there's no crime in being wrong,
but I think that they've taken us to a

59
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:36,400
point in terms of economic policy that
is not good and we have all paid a price

60
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,410
in terms of the cataclysm of the past
two years.

61
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,180
Understand that when the meltdown
occurred.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,390
And so let's begin at the point of the
meltdown prior to the meltdown,

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,960
to give you a quick answer on that,
leverage was completely out of control

64
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,400
there.
There should have been dramatic

65
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:54,320
limitations in a,
in back of leverage.

66
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:57,980
There should have been a redefinition of
what banks that had access to the

67
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,350
federal window,
Federal Reserve Window in terms of tax

68
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,120
gain,
gaining access to federal guarantees in

69
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:05,450
actual cash could do with that money.
And that's prospectively as well.

70
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,310
So retrospectively they failed to
control that,

71
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,930
the leverage and the risk that was
coursing through the system.

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,040
And that's why we refer to it as
systemic risk prospectively.

73
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,100
The fundamental reform we need and put,
thankfully the president has now begun

74
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,250
to listen to Paul Volcker much more than
to Tim Geithner and Larry Summers on

75
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:24,650
this.
We're beginning to say to banks,

76
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,070
we will know no longer permit you to ask
taxpayers to cover the downside while

77
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,510
you keep the upside.

78
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,190
It knows the asymmetry between risk and
reward is what led to the massive

79
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:40,580
overleveraging and overexposure of the
system.

80
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,890
It's what we would have called it
somebody else's line,

81
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,530
not mine.
We've socialized risk and privatized

82
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:49,640
gain and anytime I can play with a huge
pile of money and if I lose,

83
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,170
it's your problem.
But if I win,

84
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:54,500
I keep the upside.
Of course I'm going to get involved in

85
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:58,730
much riskier investments than I should
and so we need to correct that balance.

86
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,360
Scale back the leverage.
Tell the banks do what banks are

87
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:05,660
supposed to do.
If you want access to federal dollars to

88
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:09,590
d guaranteed deposits,
lend that money to people who will

89
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,140
create jobs,
who will be businesses borrowing to

90
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:15,380
expand rather than using it for either
hedge funds,

91
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,630
private equity investments,
proprietary trading,

92
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,620
the sorts of endeavors that create great
risk through the system.

93
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,670
So that is one structural issue,
which the president has now begun to

94
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:28,460
focus on,
whether it's post Massachusetts and post

95
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,800
political,
uh,

96
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,160
you know,
melt down or not,

97
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,650
doesn't really matter to me.
He's now getting that right.

98
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:37,310
And I'm hoping that Geitner and summers
or having their wings clipped too,

99
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:40,900
because they're the ones who were not
articulating for the president.

100
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,670
The obligation to put that sort of
reform in place.
