1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,090
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,300
no,
we,

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,140
we,
we really see our role as,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,010
as a starting point for people when
they're looking for news.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,710
Um,
our goal is really to try and help

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,830
people find the information they're
looking for yet in that way it's,

7
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:22,280
it's,
it's no different from what we're trying

8
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:26,000
to do with web search and it will show
headlines or snippets or sometimes just

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,490
the source named itself.
And then when people want to read that

10
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:30,020
story,
we send them directly after the

11
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,130
publisher's site.
So,

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,510
I mean,
in a given month,

13
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:35,240
just from Google news alone,
not even talking about Google,

14
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:37,350
the broader search index,
um,

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,120
we send about a billion clicks every
single month.

16
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,170
The publishers worldwide,
because I mean,

17
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,520
that's,
that's really consistent with what we're

18
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,840
trying to do.
We don't have content,

19
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:47,480
we don't have any editors and
journalists creating stories.

20
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,520
Uh,
we're just trying to surface that great

21
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,820
content that people are,
are,

22
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,170
are creating every single day,
whether it's traditional sources that

23
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:57,130
have been around for hundreds of years
or are new startups that are,

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,810
uh,
that are just fresh to the market.

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,260
Um,
and we have no intention of,

26
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:05,940
of,
you know,

27
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,920
pain simply for indexing a information,
but,

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,130
um,
I think sometimes there is a perception

29
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:15,070
that a,
it's an either or proposition that I can

30
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:17,350
put my content on the web and make it
freely available,

31
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,270
but if I decide to put up a paywall it
can't be,

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,070
I can't make it discoverable and that's
not the case.

33
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,910
And actually publishers who decided to
put up a paywall,

34
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,230
um,
can still be discovered within Google at

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,070
Wall Street Journal is actually a,
is a perfect example of that.

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:30,970
Um,
they've,

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,830
they've,
uh,

38
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,260
since they'd been on the web,
they've always had at least some set of

39
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,100
their content behind a paywall and
they've charged subscribers for that and

40
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,870
uh,
and that content has been available

41
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:44,230
within google news and also within
Google search as well.

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,040
So there are opportunities for
publishers if they decide that they feel

43
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,430
that they can charge for that content,
users are willing to pay for that,

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,370
they can do that and still decide that
they want to be discovered within

45
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,580
google.
So it's not a,

46
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,720
I don't think there,
there,

47
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,770
there are a number of different options
of how they can do so.

48
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,880
So it's not a,
I don't think it has to be an either or

49
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:04,520
proposition.
I think it would be a worse thing for,

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,580
for the end user if there are certain
searches,

51
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,920
return certain information and other
ones didn't.

52
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,260
Um,
but a publisher can decide how much

53
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,370
access they want to give for different
search engines and,

54
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,360
and do that fairly easily with just a
simple bit of code on their pages.

55
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:16,810
Right now.
