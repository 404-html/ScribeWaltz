1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,580
That is a challenge and every artist has
to figure out the right balance.

2
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,320
You don't want to represent a brand
that,

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,800
that dishonors your name,
that,

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,800
that cheapens you.
Uh,

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,270
but you also know that in this climate
with records record sales going down

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,880
and,
uh,

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,860
with record label spending a lot less
money on marketing,

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,420
we need to find other marketing partners
to get our music out.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,140
And so I've entered into strategic
partnerships with different,

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,470
with different brands in order to get my
music out to the people.

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,830
And I only do it with brands that I
think reflect well on me and that

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,490
respect my fans and my music and want to
put out messages that are consistent

13
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,210
with music.
And with,

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,400
I think the taste of my thing.
