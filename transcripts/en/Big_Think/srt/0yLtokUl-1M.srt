1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,260
I don't think you think about building a
company.

2
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:08,450
I think you think about building a 
product.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,940
A lot of people ask me

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,290
the dieting,
how did you start a company?

5
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:15,650
And I always responded,
we never started a company.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,040
A company is a byproduct of making a 
great product.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,083
We made six bags for Kate.
We made two for Jack and made them 

8
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:27,920
really well and slowly but surely,
um,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,933
found an audience for those bags,
sold them to the right stores who had 

10
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:34,910
the customers who we believed would 
appreciate those.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,730
So we limited the distribution.
Um,

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,593
let it kind of go where it,
where would go naturally and really 

13
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:42,890
focused on the product.
I mean,

14
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:43,724
if you focus on the product and you 
watch the market and you understand 

15
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:46,724
where there are voids and you find 
something that's new that satisfies a 

16
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,740
need,
it's,

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,270
it's so old school and simple,
um,

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,430
and be consistent about it and watch 
quality,

19
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:59,510
hire great people.
Really stay true to your original vision

20
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,820
and then just expand on it.
Um,

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,460
then you have a company and a brand,
uh,

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,043
France take a long time.
You can't build history into something 

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,360
we can't compete with.
The Europeans have been around a hundred

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,193
years,
so we have to be more innovative and a 

25
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:15,280
little bit more clever and intelligent.
Um,

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,020
because no one believes something's well
made when it's two years old,

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,883
you know?
Um,

28
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,440
if you're a hundred year old company

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,210
still going,
you obviously know what you're doing.

30
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,693
Does that make sense?
