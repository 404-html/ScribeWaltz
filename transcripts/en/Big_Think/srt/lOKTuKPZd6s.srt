1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,270
One of the biggest factor that can
effect this is a tension,

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,580
for instance.
I mean,

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,550
if you do not pay attention to
something,

4
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:25,200
it's very unlikely that you will learn
what,

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,510
uh,
you have.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,140
Uh,
what,

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,900
what,
uh,

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,100
he just,
uh,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,700
just so for instance,
just to make an example,

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,590
a,
I bet the many people may not have as

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,260
many of us remember what we did on
September 11th because you know,

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,440
there was a coincidence just if we paid
particular attention to or,

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,850
or what happened that day.
I bet that much less people will

14
00:00:56,851 --> 00:01:00,780
remember what happened the day before or
two days before.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,920
So that's attention is also is very,
very important.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,310
Another factor that it is very important
that would be motivation to,

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,740
if you don't care about doing something,
he will not learn about.

18
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:19,290
If you are depressed or things like
that.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,220
You will not learn what he,
uh,

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,030
what you just saw.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,770
What you just did will not memorize what
you just did.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,610
Obviously,
you need to be able to perceive the

23
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:36,210
stimulus.
If you cannot see no way that he will

24
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:40,530
remember us
or she's not here.

25
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:45,531
You cannot remember words,
so we need to be able to get through to

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,900
those,
uh,

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,030
those things.
This is the staff that we help

28
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,430
remembering of usually a,
those are not the only things because we

29
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,580
can monitor also to chemicals and uh,
uh,

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,260
two other ways.
Also memories and hopefully in the

31
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:11,610
future will be even better at that.
So we can also stimulate memory

32
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,623
chemical.

33
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,490
They,
what they do,

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,490
they,
they will work at the level of the

35
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,650
synaptic connection.
And since at the time or memory,

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,100
there is a chain of chemical reaction
and the level of signups and I came here

37
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:34,620
actually means the same as soon as a
protein enzyme molecules are activated.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,560
What do we do?
We kind of forced the system artificial

39
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,580
through this chemical and so the
knowledge this chemicals to announce a,

40
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,760
to announce a memory and they will do
this very well in animals and hopefully

41
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,990
we'll be able to do it in people as
well.

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,350
How many chemicals that one can use to
enhance memory.

43
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,860
And there are many proteins that are
relevant to the process of learning and

44
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,060
memory.
For instance,

45
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,140
uh,
uh,

46
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,440
all chemicals that act on a particular
gene,

47
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,600
particular gene by the name of crab,
um,

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
that stimulate his gene and they came
out in several different ways are all

49
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,370
molecule that in animals work quite well
at enhancing memory

50
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,960
they had available.
But we can give an extra,

51
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,510
an additional amount.
What we do in with these chemicals,

52
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,281
we take advantage of knowledge or what
normally happens in nature and a little

53
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:52,471
bit push in this is ending diseases even
easier because sometime if in disease we

54
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,940
find out that one of this chemical is a
less,

55
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,070
uh,
in lower amount than what you would be

56
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:04,030
normally.
We just help the process by giving it

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,170
efficiently.
