1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,870
Well,
it was incredibly unjust because they

2
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,210
had a hundred to one ratio.
For example,

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:20,211
if you had a one gram of cocaine powder,
uh,

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,260
if you had 100th the amount of crack
cocaine,

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,560
that those would be considered equal.
And I think that crack cocaine typically

6
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,360
has been associated with,
uh,

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,570
communities that are lower income,
poor people.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,100
Whereas,
you know,

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,963
at,
uh,

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,980
you know,
parties in Aspen,

11
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:44,320
people aren't smoking crack.
So it did have a,

12
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:46,370
a horror,
horrific effect.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,320
Um,
on population.

14
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:53,130
I do federal criminal work and I've seen
a number of,

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,670
uh,
young people with face horrific

16
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,530
sentencing because of,
uh,

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,530
their involvement with the crack
cocaine,

18
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:06,300
maybe on a very superficial level,
but because of the way the sentencing

19
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,750
guidelines were structured,
there is no such thing as a small case.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,711
Well,
I mean,

21
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,580
they would have to have a hundred times
as much as the equivalent amount of

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,830
crack.
And from what I've learned that,

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,440
uh,
to convert powder cocaine to crack,

24
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:26,490
it's a one to one basis.
So if you were in the federal system,

25
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:31,491
it's insidious enough that if there was
proof that you intended to convert,

26
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:35,880
say 50 grams of powder into 50 grams of
crack,

27
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,160
it would be treated at the hundred to
one ratio.

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,083
Yeah.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,420
Well,
I dunno if anybody anybody's destined to

30
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:50,340
be to for the criminal justice system,
but if you grow up in an area of low

31
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,710
income where,
uh,

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,860
where most many people are not working,
where there is,

33
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,000
there's not much employment where
there's not a lot of,

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,330
uh,
guidance.

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,760
Inevitably,
uh,

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,880
people,
there are a lot of opportunities to

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,590
become involved in criminal activity.
Also in the,

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,080
uh,
in the lower income communities,

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,710
people are more,
much more likely to resolve disputes

40
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:27,711
simply by dialing nine one one.
And police are more predisposed to just

41
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:33,280
simply arresting people rather than
trying to resolve an issue or see if the

42
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:38,281
issue really requires an arrest.
So you see a tremendous amount of people

43
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:44,961
that in other communities
there wouldn't have been the opportunity

44
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:48,270
to get in crime.
Uh,

45
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,870
things that they do would not have been
treated as a crime.

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,140
Um,
but for the fact that that's the way

47
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,150
that,
uh,

48
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,280
the police handle things,
people and people are very,

49
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,130
uh,
it's very easy to dial nine one one to

50
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:08,131
resolve a problem.
Well,

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,550
again,
I think it's a,

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,750
the funding,
the funding programs to,

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,480
to,
uh,

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
help addiction education programs to
stop people from becoming involved in a

55
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,380
substance,
you know,

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,760
substance abuse situations,
job training,

57
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,030
people that are working are far less
likely to be come involved,

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,020
uh,
in crime.

59
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:43,080
They don't have to,
to take things too to support

60
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:48,081
themselves.
So I think a lot of money would be

61
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:52,740
better spent before people get into the
criminal justice system.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,610
Then now we,
now we spend the most amount of money.

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,750
And when I say we,
I'm talking about government in,

64
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,730
in building presence to simply warehouse
people.

65
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:03,990
And that's why,
uh,

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,480
this country has more people in jail
than any other,

67
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:07,960
yeah.

68
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,420
Per capita than any country in the
world.

69
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,920
And that's,
that's pretty horrific.

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,420
Well,
I still am loath to sort of to say that

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,880
someone that's committed a crime,
even if they've gone to prison,

72
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:29,390
that they're going to be like anyone
else because they're still individuals.

73
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,050
So I think it really depends.
Um,

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,740
there's no rehabilitation as far as
rehabilitation education.

75
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,950
Uh,
very little is spent on that.

76
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:47,180
Most of the money for corrections is
spent on,

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,690
uh,
protection and,

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,520
uh,
it really making sure people don't

79
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:59,390
escape,
don't have engage in violence with other

80
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:03,050
inmates.
But there's not a lot done to see that

81
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,930
when people get out that they won't
repeat those behaviors.

82
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,510
But I still think it depends on the
individual.

83
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:11,120
If they're coming out and they have a
supportive family,

84
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,570
uh,
they probably have a shot.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,860
If they're coming out to nothing and,
and they had an extensive criminal

86
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:22,190
history beforehand and they're going
back to the neighborhood where they've

87
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,340
gotten arrested and prosecuted

88
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,330
over and over again.
I think there's a little hope that

89
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:31,340
they're going to turn their entire life
around.

90
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,990
I think towards if,
uh,

91
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,410
if towards the end of people

92
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,970
sentence,
I know in,

93
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,850
in,
in the federal system,

94
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:46,160
depending on what crime you were
convicted of,

95
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,980
they release people to halfway houses,
uh,

96
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,180
and conditionally released people.
So they get some sort of job skills or

97
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,130
trading.
There has to be something other than

98
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,580
sitting in a cell for 20 years.
And then on the day that your schedule

99
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,950
of the release,
they simply open the door for you and

100
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,470
give you your clothes that you came in
with.

101
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,510
If there's,
uh,

102
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,960
one would hope that towards the end of
sentencing,

103
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:16,961
some effort is made to,
to match that individual up with some

104
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,841
sort of preparation for the world
outside cause the world.

105
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,330
Not only is it different from being in,
uh,

106
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,180
from their experience in being
incarcerated,

107
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,520
but the world is different from when
they went in.

108
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,730
Yeah.
