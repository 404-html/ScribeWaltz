1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,070
You can sense that.
I mean,

2
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:10,820
I,
I,

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,480
I'm,
I remember the first time I met,

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,710
I'm,
Meryl Streep was at this theater that I

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,660
told you about,
the Phoenix theater.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,530
And she walked in and she had her pants
old tied up because she was riding a

7
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:31,631
bike to the audition and she had a wheel
or wheel of her pain in her hands and

8
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,690
her hair was all messy.
And I thought,

9
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,450
oh my God,
she's glorious.

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,110
She is.
She's just beautiful.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,240
And,
um,

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,040
so you do get those feelings.
You Do,

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,210
you are drawn to people that,
you know,

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,160
come in,
come sit down next to you and talk to

15
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:58,880
you and you see something,
maybe they're not necessarily right for

16
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,440
the park,
but there's something about their

17
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,930
personalities.
Maybe you want to put them in another

18
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:03,800
role.
Um,

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,260
but yes,
the room changes,

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,620
the color changes.
Usually golden golden,

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,170
golden yellow I think is for me.

22
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,370
And I get very excited and you know,
and,

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,610
and,
and try to place these performers in,

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,630
in,
in,

25
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:24,140
um,
in either the role that they've come in

26
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,020
for,
or in another part,

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,590
I like to think that when I cast or
movie

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,310
or even working on a movie,
that it would be a movie that people

29
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:41,150
will see a hundred years from now.
I think that's what I always look at

30
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,040
things like,
will people look at this project,

31
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,110
this movie,
this actor,

32
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:50,480
and a hundred years in the same way we
look at,

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,630
uh,
Betty Davis and,

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,690
and,
and cary grant and Humphrey Bogart.

35
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,690
And,
and

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,410
I think we were looking at them for a
very long time.

37
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,860
I think that's the,
the,

38
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,890
the goal to see that talent that you
think will last forever and ever and

39
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:12,160
ever.
