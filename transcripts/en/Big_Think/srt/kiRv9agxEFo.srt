1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,240
I'm the Felix Frankfurter professor of
law at Harvard Law School where I've

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,310
been teaching for

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,860
43 years.
Uh,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,130
Larry Summers and I had a contest for
who got tenure,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,380
youngest.
I had been the youngest professor to get

6
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,570
tenure at Harvard.
And then he beat me by three right

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,570
maths when he got,
I grew up in a frightened,

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,460
I was born

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,250
on the eve of the Holocaust,
1938.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,620
Um,
my mother,

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,550
when my brother was born,
my mother kept saying she didn't know

12
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:39,480
whether she would have him in some
bunker in the basement somewhere.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,490
We were all terrified of war and we were
all terrified of what was happening to

14
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,130
the Jewish community.
It was a powerless community at the

15
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,830
time.
Hard to imagine today,

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,820
but no influence in Congress,
no influence,

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,970
um,
really in any aspect of politics.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,060
Um,
it was a community that really felt that

19
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,100
they were the guests in somebody else's
country.

20
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:06,810
They were second class citizens.
They were tolerated at best and they had

21
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,370
better behave.
Uh,

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,090
and it was a community of people who are
very patriotic,

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,600
quite conservative in their outlook
toward,

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,130
uh,
many things.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,370
Um,
people sometimes stereotype the Jewish

26
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,500
communities being very radical,
a community.

27
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:26,400
And there are many secular Jews who were
radical during that period of time.

28
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,750
Some communists and socialists,
but in the Orthodox community,

29
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,000
I grew up in quite conservative,
quite patriotic.

30
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,160
Uh,
and um,

31
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,680
uh,
frightened is the word I think I would

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,020
use more than any other.
Uh,

33
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,040
the message I constantly got from my
parents and grandparents was shushed.

34
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,630
Still be quiet,
be quiet,

35
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,730
don't rock the boat,
don't do anything.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,690
Don't make your hosts the real Americans
mad at you.

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,300
Uh,
whatever you do do quietly.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,020
Obviously it didn't take with me and um,
I reacted.

39
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,960
Yeah,
I think too that

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,360
it's always nice to say your parents had
the greatest influence.

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,310
I would say.
In my case,

42
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,100
my father had very little influence on
my growing up.

43
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:12,340
He was very busy.
He had a small store which was not

44
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,710
particularly successful.
He was away all the time,

45
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:18,340
six days a week at work.
And the seventh day was the sabbath,

46
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:22,930
a day of rest where his job was to get
me up and drag me to the synagogue and

47
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:25,840
sit next to him.
While he went pray,

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,200
pray.
So the interaction wasn't particularly,

49
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,910
uh,
intimate or close.

50
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,920
My mother was somewhat ambitious for me
and she did defend me when I got into

51
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:40,921
trouble and kind of showed me a little
bit how you can stand up for rights.

52
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:45,400
But I think my greatest impact came from
teachers and peers.

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,770
Um,
particularly after I got out of the

54
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,830
yeshiva system.
I don't think the Jewish parochial

55
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:52,780
school system had much of an impact on
me.

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,840
I rebelled against it in that respect.
It did have an impact.

57
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,300
But when I got to Brooklyn College and
Yale Law School,

58
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,780
I was looking role models.
Uh,

59
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,570
I quickly learned there are no such
thing and that every hero has clay feet

60
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,180
and that everybody I respected,
Oh,

61
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:12,181
it was a flawed human being,
but I was able to learn quite a bit,

62
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,930
both intellectually and morally from
some of my mentors,

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,670
particularly the two,
uh,

64
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,780
judges I clerked for after I finished
law school or Justice Arthur Goldberg of

65
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,720
the United States Supreme Court and
Judge David Basil on,

66
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:30,040
they were both activists,
left liberal,

67
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,330
moderate left wing Jews,
labor union activists,

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,680
progressive's.
And they showed me how I could live a

69
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,890
Jewish life life in which I was not
embarrassed about my heritage,

70
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,700
where I could make the best of it and
use the best from it and still

71
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,270
contribute,
uh,

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
to America the world and not live in the
Shtetl in the ghetto from which,

73
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,010
uh,
I grew up

74
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,040
and grew out
would

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,513
probably be

76
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,100
one summer in camp.
I was,

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,740
um,
between my junior and senior year in

78
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,570
high school,
I was a terrible high school student.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,160
Uh,
I got cs and b minuses.

80
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,960
In fact,
my yearbook originally said I was a good

81
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,700
speaker.
Some of your books had Dershowitz,

82
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:18,860
he has a mouth of webster and ahead of
clay.

83
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,320
It was cute.
And um,

84
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,000
my,
my rabbi said to me,

85
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:23,840
look,
Dershowitz,

86
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:24,860
you know,
you've got a good mouth on.

87
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:27,530
You're not a very good brain.
You've got to figure out a profession

88
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,510
that you can use your mouth a lot and
not your head.

89
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,820
Uh,
you should either be a lawyer or he said

90
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,380
a conservative rabbi.
He was,

91
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:36,260
of course an Orthodox rabbi and that was
the biggest put down you could,

92
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,140
you could have.
So I was put down a lot in high school

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,130
and there was this one guy in camp who
was four or five years older than me who

94
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:43,964
was a counselor.

95
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,650
And he picked me to play the leading
role in a play Cyrano de Bergerac by

96
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:51,230
Edmund Rustin.
Remember it as if it was today.

97
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,140
It was not only my long knows that
qualified me for the job,

98
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,210
but I was not a bad,
bad actor.

99
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,400
And uh,
and he was the first person,

100
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,050
he sat me down one day and said,
you know,

101
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,650
you're smart,
you have a very interesting mind,

102
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,730
you see things differently,
you're going to be a great student in

103
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:08,720
college.
I said,

104
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,510
come on,
I can't even get decent grades in a

105
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,090
third rate,
crummy high school.

106
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:16,760
How am I going to do well in college?
And he said,

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,510
the better the school you go to,
the better you'll do.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,430
And he was absolutely right.
I went to Brooklyn College,

109
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:23,480
I did very,
very well.

110
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:25,760
And then I went to Yale law school and I
was first in my class.

111
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,670
Yale law school was one of the elite
institutions.

112
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:32,510
He was so right that the more
challenging the institution,

113
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,290
the better I was going to do.
And that was an insight that I just

114
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,310
didn't have.
Day.

115
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,900
I started this,
there was never any other path.

116
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,920
Me,
I was always a lawyer from the time I

117
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,770
was five or six years old.
My father,

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,340
although an uneducated didn't finish
high school,

119
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,010
um,
and it didn't read very much.

120
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,350
Uh,
uh,

121
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,070
worker.
Um,

122
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,630
he liked to stand up for the underdog
and he did convey that to me.

123
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,240
And my family had a tradition of
standing up for the underdog.

124
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:10,241
My father's family helped rescue people
from the Holocaust and social action and

125
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,560
social commitment was part of my
heritage in some respects.

126
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,880
But I always thought I was going to be a
lawyer and the only kind of a lawyer I

127
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,310
ever thought of was a criminal or who.
What else is there?

128
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,610
I'm not working for the government.
I wouldn't work for big government or

129
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,390
big corporations.
I had to be the lawyer for the underdog.

130
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,620
So I don't think I ever made a decision
to be a lawyer or a criminal lawyer.

131
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,890
It was just something that I always
thought I would do.

132
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,290
Others thought I would do what was
expected of me.

133
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,230
It was a role I played since the time I
was a child.
