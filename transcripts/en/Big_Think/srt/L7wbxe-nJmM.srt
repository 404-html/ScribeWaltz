1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,330
Capitalism is based on a set of rational
choice theory.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,420
Rational choice theory is I'm mathematic
formulation that has demonstrably

3
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:20,460
benefits in terms of avoiding,
um,

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,030
simple errors in judgment and decision
making.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,350
Um,
it's undergoing some revision because

6
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,960
some of the biases and errors that we
make,

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,410
uh,
can be understood and improve those

8
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:36,590
formulas.
But there are two assumptions underlying

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,210
rational choice that are assumptions.
They're not part of the mathematics,

10
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,800
they're assumptions.
One is,

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,840
uh,
because short term interests and the

12
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:48,110
other is selfish interests.
You do what's good for you.

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,820
And it's as society becomes more
complex,

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,000
as scientific inquiry becomes more
complex,

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,060
has daily living,
he comes more complex,

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,720
um,
coordinating our efforts together

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,510
working so that we can trust one
another.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,950
Uh,
specialized,

19
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:13,220
I can count on you to do a,
and I'll do b and together a and b are

20
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,380
more than the sum of the parts.

21
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,160
Um,
that kind of problem solving which

22
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:24,161
suggest selfish interests is an
assumption that may have outlived its

23
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:28,130
usefulness that it's not about being
pure alteras.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,890
Uh,
it's about coming up with something

25
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,970
where you relate to other people in a
fashion where everybody benefits more,

26
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,390
where the sum is greater than the total
is greater than the sum of the parts.

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,240
And that's,
uh,

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,970
that's just an assumption.
If we put that assumption in the

29
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,630
rational choice theory,
all of a sudden capitalism looks a

30
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,640
little bit different.
We look for sustainability,

31
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,641
we look for things that are good for the
community as well as for the company.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,970
Um,
and you see such efforts,

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,310
uh,
southwest airline is just one airline

34
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:02,870
that was built,
uh,

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,420
caring as much about their employees as
the customers.

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,560
And,
uh,

37
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:07,750
you know,
southwest has been,

38
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,100
uh,
something of a business success stories.

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,480
Some of the Asian companies are
similarly constructed around a concern

40
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:19,150
for the community and the employees,
not just the stockholders.

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,520
And that is again,
they want to serve stockholders,

42
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,620
but they want to serve beyond
stockholders and a,

43
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:26,550
those are again,
some of the real success stories.

44
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,470
So I think we're seeing precedents set
and,

45
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,700
and it can,
it's not a denial of rational choice

46
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,860
theory.
It's really just a questioning of one of

47
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,930
the assumptions underlying it.
And I think there's,

48
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,290
there's good reason to pursue what
might,

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,040
what might be done with capitalism with
that assumption.

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,173
A change.

51
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,860
CHICAGO,
I've worked with

52
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,180
some economists sentence.
One of the things that we look at are

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,560
the errors.
People making judgment.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,910
Um,
oh,

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,720
35 years ago,
economists never assume did rational

56
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,721
choice that people were rational.
They assume that irrationality was so

57
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,410
irrational,
is to be random.

58
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,400
And economics isn't about predicting an
individual behavior.

59
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,970
That's the domain of psychology.
Economics is about predicting aggregate

60
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,840
behavior.
Well,

61
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,660
if I have complete irrationality,
that's random,

62
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,990
that's just like noise and I average
over many such random noise.

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,210
That sums does zero.
So you're left with just rationality.

64
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,270
Uh,
I think what the last 30 years of

65
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,630
research and particularly current
research and behavioral economics and in

66
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:41,920
neuroeconomics this showing us that the
irrationality of systematic,

67
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,950
it's not always random.
There were systematic biases that we

68
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,520
introduced.
One of the biases that that people show

69
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,521
is if they want to not come to be true,
they overestimate the odds versus if

70
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:58,000
they don't want the outcome to be true.
And so that's it's bias that once you

71
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:02,290
realize you can tweak the mathematics
just so that it's more [inaudible]

72
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,880
presented about how humans actually
think can be age.

73
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,750
I think our research,
Sean,

74
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,780
what's fundamentally all about

75
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,840
human nature has implications for how we
live our lives now.

76
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,390
Businesses conduct research.
Um,

77
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,790
there is a sense in which bringing these
teams together with different expertise

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,240
gives you the opportunity to attack
problems,

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,110
come up with more creative solutions
than not because of the complexity you

80
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,970
need those different levels of
expertise,

81
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,220
but it bringing people together isn't
sufficient.

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,760
Being,
overcoming loneliness isn't about just

83
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,700
connecting with another person.
It's connecting at a deep level.

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,820
That's reinforcing for both individuals.
Businesses if they understand that

85
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,150
principle can understand that bringing
experts together isn't sufficient.

86
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:02,500
It's bringing the experts together and
allowing them or promoting their

87
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,520
connection so that it's beyond what
would you normally would get.

88
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,620
So,
just to give you an example in the

89
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,270
research domain,
uh,

90
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,230
I've been a member of research teams
where we would fly into a vicinity.

91
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,011
We meet,
meet,

92
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,050
meet.
Once I flew to Bergen,

93
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,970
Norway,
which was a long flight.

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,440
We met in some hotel meeting room for
two days and then flew home.

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,130
I have no idea what Norway looked like.
It was one of the most miserable

96
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,360
meetings.
I was just jet lag.

97
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,000
That's all it was.
And I'm sure we got something from the

98
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,260
meeting,
but not very much.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,750
Uh,
there are other meetings.

100
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,540
Uh,
I,

101
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,890
I run a large interdisciplinary team of
wonderful,

102
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,830
wonderful colleagues.
The research in the book is really

103
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:46,270
representing the work of many different
scientific disciplines and expertise.

104
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,740
Um,
and when we,

105
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,040
when we come together to meet,
we meet off campus first of all and we

106
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,920
meet off campus because when we're on
campus,

107
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,120
we're busy.
I mean,

108
00:05:55,121 --> 00:06:00,050
we all have things going on and we,
it's hard to disconnect our minds from

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,460
our students and our colleagues and
other demands when we go off campus.

110
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,610
We also bring family with us and we have
meetings only for about six hours a day

111
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,160
and we have formal gatherings as a
group.

112
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,170
We eat together,
we break bread together,

113
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,920
we'd go on outings together,
we go for walks together in various sub

114
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,680
pairings.
And what that allows you to do is rather

115
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,930
than saying this is what I know and
promoting,

116
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:28,910
that you start to like these people,
you start to understand and want to want

117
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:30,860
to understand more about their
perspective.

118
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,190
And so rather than relying just on what
we all already agree so we can get outta

119
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:37,850
here,
you say,

120
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,391
well,
okay,

121
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,900
that's what we all think,
but that's the common knowledge and we

122
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,740
all had that's not actually taking
advantage of the expertise that unique.

123
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,740
And really the reason we're all here is
because of the unique knowledge,

124
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,190
not the common knowledge.
That takes longer and that unique

125
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,280
knowledge starts to come out on these
walks and it starts to come out in the

126
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,270
meetings after you've done those walks
because it's not about coming to a quick

127
00:06:59,271 --> 00:06:59,690
solution.

128
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,720
It's about coming to a playful that
said,

129
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,000
well tell me what you might know and why
would you think that.

130
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,770
I mean,
and I'm not attacking you in that.

131
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm actually curious in that.
So all of a sudden the language

132
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,060
differences and the disciplinary
differences are easier to bridge.

133
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,360
I think that in that lesson in science,
there's a lesson for businesses as well

134
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,880
to bring together expertise and that
expertise may be different,

135
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,730
uh,
parts of the product line or it may be

136
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:28,400
labor versus management,
different interests,

137
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:31,220
expertise.
How does one transcend and really do

138
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,270
something that's better for everybody in
the longterm?

139
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,290
Because that's,
that's what I think the secret of our,

140
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,070
our species,
we're very good at coming up with those

141
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,330
new kind of social kind of construct.
If you look at the emperor penguin,

142
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,100
they require huddles to get through the
winter there.

143
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,770
I think they get together in this
collective and without that collective,

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,420
none of them would survive.
Right?

145
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,520
That's the vehicle for genetic
transmission is this group that's bigger

146
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:02,480
than the individual.
That's the only collective unit.

147
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,190
Humans have many such collectors and we
can create them and recreate them on a

148
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,460
moment by moment basis.
And so the real talent and capacity

149
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,280
comes from how do we configure those so
that they're productive.

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:19,730
Yeah.
