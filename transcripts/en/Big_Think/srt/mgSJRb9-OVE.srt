1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,170
I think that's a,
I think that's a

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,970
crazy idea.
If you look at,

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,690
if you look at the growth of prosperity
in this country,

4
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:26,701
it's basically continued unabated and
the truth of the matter is that the,

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,060
what drives this economy is innovation
and ideas and the fact that a

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,180
manufacturing shifts around the world,
even some services shift around the

7
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:45,040
world doesn't mean that American
businesses is finished.

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,100
What is going to be true is that we're
going to see a lot of.

9
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,110
We are seeing already a lot of economic
growth elsewhere in the world and China

10
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:56,050
and India and Brazil,
uh,

11
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,690
the,
the emerging market countries are

12
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:03,691
experiencing just extraordinary changes
in economic wellbeing and many American

13
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:09,820
companies like General Electric or like
Citibank,

14
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:14,821
see a lot of their future growth as
taking place in those markets.

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,160
But the fact that they're,
that they're going to do well only bodes

16
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,340
well for us.
Not a,

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,260
not anything else.
So.
