1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,303
No

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,450
latte in
the middle of Ohio now you know when

3
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:20,241
Seinfeld was on and everybody loved it,
guess what was Jews from New York like

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,120
this idea that we're so out of touch and
that this culture we've come up with

5
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,980
here is anathema to the rest of the
country.

6
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,030
Like guess what?
This isn't where we are as well.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,050
Real American as everybody else.
And sure there are more liberals here,

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,180
you know?
Sure Sir.

9
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:44,181
We're used to a more heterogeneous
population in New York City than what I

10
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,010
just saw when I was reporting in Maine
last week,

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,550
but there was plenty of Latte and we're
not that different and we're not any

12
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,320
less American.
Well matter of.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,910
Sorry about the facts.
Sorry.

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,940
That that big science,
which is to say scientists have realized

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,310
that if we keep doing things the way
we're doing them,

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,420
we are going to end the world.
Sorry.

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,120
I mean I wish it weren't so like,
but it doesn't make it

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,680
a liberal phenomenon.
I mean I used to just beyond my

19
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:28,690
comprehension.
The thing I was going to say about the

20
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:33,691
New York Times is you'll notice that as
much as the president likes to say it's

21
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,390
fake news,
the minute he goes in meets with their

22
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,850
editors,
he says it's a great American treasure,

23
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,970
you know,
I mean it is the paper of record and now

24
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:45,970
and in fairness,
they did make some mistakes.

25
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,060
They're humans like all that stuff
around the wmds and the and the windup

26
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:55,060
theory I rapport.
That is serious stuff that happened that

27
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:59,170
the times got wrong,
that eroded public trust,

28
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,270
but I don't actually think that's what's
going.

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,080
I don't think that's what this election
was about.

30
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,020
I mean,
we know for fact that it wasn't.

31
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:13,021
We know for a fact that there was a very
targeted system for disseminating fake

32
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:14,404
news.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,630
Long form journalism is the only thing
I've ever done.

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,250
Right.
That end writing books,

35
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:23,740
you know,
I don't know how to be a newspaper

36
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,510
journalist.
I think what they do is incredibly

37
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,820
impressive,
but I'm not trained to do it.

38
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:31,900
I don't know how to do it,
and they have a different mandate than

39
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,471
we do.
I mean,

40
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:37,280
their mandate is to attempt objectivity,
um,

41
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,220
and ours isn't,
I mean we are meant to tell the truth

42
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:46,930
and everything you read in the New
Yorker has been fact checked more than

43
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:51,931
you can believe.
But the overall story I'm telling in any

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,910
given,
no matter what it is,

45
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,200
it's always my version and it's not my
mandate to be,

46
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,900
to be without a perspective.
It's not my mandate to,

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,220
to remove myself,
to have the least,

48
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,340
uh,
present authorial voice.

49
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,900
I can't,
that's not my mandate.

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,590
My mandate is to try to make it
interesting for the reader while

51
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,150
informing the reader,
you know,

52
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,030
with,
with,

53
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,510
you know,
a complete allegiance to accuracy.

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,950
But I'm allowed to tell the story
however I want to.

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
And that's the luxury.
I mean,

56
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,810
that's being a long form.
That's being a magazine journalist and

57
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,630
that's what I love about it.
I'm never,

58
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:42,631
I'm never endeavoring to make myself or
my point of view invisible.

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,590
That's not my mandate.
I'm trying to be subtle about it because

60
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,480
the,
the,

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,110
the quieter and sort of,
you know,

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,120
the more the,
if I'm sly about it,

63
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,210
that it's more persuasive because you
don't want to feel that someone's

64
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,340
directed you to think this,
that and the other.

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
You want to feel that,
you think that,

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,460
but it's my job to lead you to think
whatever it is I want you to.

67
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,921
I mean,
just there's,

68
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,560
I don't think there's a.
It depends,

69
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,410
depends,
depends how honest the individual

70
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:19,411
journalist is
and how much and how much allegiance he

71
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:23,560
or she has to the truth to accuracy,
you know,

72
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:28,561
I mean,
I am not wed to making every person feel

73
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,280
that their perspective has been
represented.

74
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,950
I'm representing my perspective when I
tell a story,

75
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,951
but every single detail in that story
will be the truth and no little false

76
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:48,670
hood is okay ever.
And we take that very seriously.
