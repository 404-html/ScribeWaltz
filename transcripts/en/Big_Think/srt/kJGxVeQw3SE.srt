1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,280
Everybody seems to think that Obama is
in his heart,

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:10,281
an atheist in India's hardest skeptic.
The church he belonged to in Chicago is

3
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:15,180
a whack job church.
It's about equal to Payton's church.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,900
Granted,
he hasn't been as religious as do we

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,310
know?
Do we know off the top of our heads,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,270
the most religious president in history,
in terms of references referencing to

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:29,271
God references to God and in terms of
appearing in churches who the most

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,730
religious president history was.
It's an interesting answer and I get

9
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:37,350
this information from NPR,
so it's probably not slanted in the way

10
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,470
you'd think.
The most religious president in history,

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,770
in terms of appearances in churches and
mentions of the Bible was Clinton.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,310
Bill Clinton is the most religious
president we've had.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,800
He Beats George Bush,
hands down,

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,610
and he beats Carter,
who you know was a born again Christian.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,110
He beats him hands down.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,580
So Obama does that too.
I mean to the nine slash 11 thing.

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,190
Maybe appropriately he read from the
Bible,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,400
but you have two choices with Obama.
You either believe that he is a man of

19
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,730
Christ who prays for decisions in the
White House,

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,180
which he said he was,
or you think he's a liar.

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,510
And I'm surprised by the number of
atheists,

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,040
pre thinkers that support Obama and
their argument is essentially he's lying

23
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,810
about being religious cause you have to
do that to be elected.

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,050
Uh,
I'm not happy with either one of those.

25
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,510
I mean,
Obama is wicked smart.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,870
He's a wicked good talker.
There is no doubt in my mind that his

27
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,060
heart is in the right place.
Unfortunately,

28
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:47,130
I think that about almost every
president we've had,

29
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,110
but I think he wants to do good.
I don't think there's any malicious

30
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:56,280
quality to them at all,
but I think it's some sense he's a

31
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,380
believer or he's a liar.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,910
So one to 10.
I rate them pretty high on the

33
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:07,911
skepticism a maybe a six or a seven,
but I rate them that way because

34
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:13,230
somewhere in my heart I think he might
be lying about being religious and

35
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,010
that's horrible.
It's a horrible reason to like somebody.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,220
I like him because he may be a liar.
Mirabelle Michele Bachmann's blast for

37
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,110
me is greater than anything I've ever
accomplished.

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,460
Uh,
I have tried with friends to say the

39
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:38,820
most blasphemous his sentence I can
possibly say,

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,570
and it does not come close to the
blasphemy of Michele Bachmann saying

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,310
that earthquakes and hurricanes were the
way God was trying to get the attention

42
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:55,311
of politicians.
I cannot imagine a serious religious

43
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:02,020
person reading that quote or hearing
that quote and saying,

44
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,220
yeah,
right on.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,030
It is solid cystic.
It is opportunistic.

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,540
It is cynical.
It is deep and it is wrong.

47
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,990
And it is an insult to religious people
everywhere.

48
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,670
For an atheist,
it's a,

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,710
it's a burlesque.
It's a little bit of a joke.

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,590
You can dismiss her,
but I can't see it as an atheist.

51
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,620
I see it from through my father's eyes.
You know,

52
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,690
my father was a Christian his whole
life,

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,130
and if he had heard Michele Bachmann say
that he would have looked away from the

54
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,940
TV,
the idea that you would lightly state

55
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,750
that people were suffering and dying in
order to,

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,680
to prove that God was on the side of one
politician is sickening.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,680
The only reason that Bachman and Rick
Perry are able to say this stuff is

58
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:59,920
because of a magic word,
and this magic word is Christian,

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and if you look back in history,
the word Christian doesn't really appear

60
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,330
in the way we use it today until the
anti abortion debate in the sixties when

61
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:18,241
you had 1890 end of the 19th century,
your top three highest paid speakers.

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,360
The highest paid speakers were atheist
speaking about atheism.

63
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,600
Robert Ingersoll number one,
Mark Twain,

64
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,800
number two,
Huxley.

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,050
Number three.
Ingersoll was the,

66
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:33,410
uh,
the,

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,130
the great infidel,
the great skeptic,

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,540
be a theist.
Mark Twain,

69
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,640
of course.
And these are people speaking on.

70
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,160
He was not reading from,
it was not reading from Oxfam.

71
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,850
He was reading from letters from Earth.
He was reading atheist stuff and Huxley,

72
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,730
Darwin's a pit bull,
I guess bulldog at that time,

73
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,170
I think if it has been,
but there was a real sense of atheism

74
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:56,140
being an important point.
They were invited to the White House.

75
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,300
And the reason was that Catholics were
terrified of baptists who were terrified

76
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,140
of pentecostals or terrified of
Lutherans who were terrified of

77
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,510
evangelicals.
The whole list.

78
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,690
There wasn't a feeling of Christian.
The founding fathers were very afraid of

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,010
baptists taking over from the
pentecostals.

80
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,080
Everybody was afraid of the Catholics.

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,850
So you had this divided thing.
If we still had that,

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,420
if we still were dividing people by sex,
like we should be sex like we should be.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,500
One of the largest groups in this
country would be atheists by the USA

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,360
Today poll,
I think it was 22 percent,

85
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,600
20 percent even the lowest polls put it
at eight.

86
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,580
Okay.
The next highest would be Catholics and

87
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,680
they'd be knocking around 20.
You know,

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,030
then you've got all your divided up
categories.

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,550
And then abortion happens.
A legalized abortion.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And some very smart people.
Very forward thinking.

91
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:09,791
People decided we can never fight
abortion if it's the Catholics fighting

92
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,890
the Protestants and finding the
baptists.

93
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,620
Pentecostals fight it.
We have to get them under one tent.

94
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,160
And there's a great book on this called
the history of free thought that these

95
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,850
are not my ideas.
They pull this tent together and they

96
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,380
kind of create the word Christian and
then Carter with born again.

97
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,390
Christian really helps with the word
Christian.

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,100
So what they've really done is they've
taken very different philosophies.

99
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,010
I mean Catholicism and Protestantism.
Protestantism are very different

100
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,990
philosophies,
very different,

101
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,830
you know,
and they've pulled it together to make

102
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:49,580
this term Christian,
which are people that don't agree at all

103
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,590
and they say,
I'm doing a Christian message.

104
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:56,591
So Michelle Bachmann and Rick Perry just
40 years ago really recently would have

105
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:04,691
been terrified to speak about their God
and their church because the second they

106
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:08,900
said they were baptist,
the second they said they were

107
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,050
pentecostal,
the second they said they were Lutheran,

108
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,660
all the other people fall away.
But now they've got this magic word

109
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:21,260
Christian.
And I am helping make it worse because

110
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:26,261
by using the word atheist,
I am separating that even more from

111
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,900
Christian.
I'm doing a broader umbrella and I'm

112
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,730
making theist,
atheist.

113
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,140
And if you do,
theist,

114
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,810
atheist,
the thesis when completely,

115
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,850
you know,
what I should be doing.

116
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
If I were a,
a,

117
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,680
uh,
a political thinker,

118
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,980
if I were someone that was interested in
movements,

119
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,480
which I'm not,
I'm against them.

120
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,930
If I wasn't for individual thinking,
I would be one of those people who was

121
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:58,361
saying using a term like free thinker or
open minded and I will be gathering this

122
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,980
umbrella that included,
um,

123
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,690
uh,
people who self identify as agnostic or

124
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,590
atheist against organized religion.
I would get the wiccans in there.

125
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,550
I would get as many people as possible
and I could probably pump that up to 25

126
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:19,490
percent.
And then I would be also saying,

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
well,
you know,

128
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,870
the Muslims are very different from the
Jews who are very different from the

129
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,670
Catholics who are very different from
all of that.

130
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,800
But what's going to happen?
And,

131
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,520
uh,
because I'm not interested in tactical

132
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,770
play,
but rather in telling the truth,

133
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,170
we're going to get theist,
atheist.

134
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,170
But you can imagine,
we can imagine in 1965 a baptist talking

135
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,230
baptist politician talking about
religion and where they go to church,

136
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,890
if they have to use word baptist,
it's using the word Christian that

137
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:02,250
allows this craziness to happen.
Also,

138
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:06,210
because I am
an optimist,

139
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,740
to the point of being incorrect,
to the point of not being realistic.

140
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,980
That's what flushes over me.
It's what I feel in my heart is

141
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:17,760
optimism.
I tend to go with something Christopher

142
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,800
Hitchens said,
I don't remember where he said it could

143
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,750
have even been in personal conversation.
I don't know,

144
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,200
but I'm hitchens said that what we're
seeing with this incredible,

145
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:31,260
crazy religious stuff is the death
throws.

146
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,330
I mean,
since nine slash 11,

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,250
a free thinking.
Atheism is growing so quickly because of

148
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:43,110
the Internet and people who were seeing
it first with those who are called.

149
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:46,470
And I realized this is a racist term,
but it's easiest one to use.

150
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,420
So please forgive me.
Uh,

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,720
Gypsy's.
We're seeing it with the amish.

152
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,740
We're seeing it with the citrix.
Uh,

153
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,750
all the groups that try to stay as a
subset of America and keep their own

154
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:06,381
traditions are going away.
And Elvis chipped away at them and malls

155
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,980
chipped away at them,
but the Internet is going to take them

156
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:13,320
down.
It's just too hard to keep your children

157
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,290
cloistered.
They're going to hear Katy Perry.

158
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,530
There's just no way to stop it.
They're going to see a video like this.

159
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,970
You know,
once you've gotten on the Internet to

160
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,180
see Katy Perry,
it's not hard to fall over to the big

161
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:29,220
thing.
It's the same keyboard.

162
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,760
It's the same screen.
It's the same everything and those that

163
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:37,761
information gets out there and I think
that everybody knows that and everybody

164
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:41,640
feels that so that those who are
religious,

165
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,000
you're seeing a a,
a desperate,

166
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,710
terrified clawing,
and that's the only way you can explain

167
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,220
Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry is the
combination of desperation coupled with

168
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:59,010
the magic protective word of Christian.

169
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,340
The problem is a movement of individuals
is not going to have the muscle of a

170
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:10,401
cohesive movement of people who believe
they're right and I'm not willing to lie

171
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:13,920
to fight them.
I want individuals who disagree on

172
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:18,921
everything and I want us to learn to
band together for freedom band together

173
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:23,820
in order to be different,
and that's a much harder thing to sell,

174
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
but it's all that matters.
So we have to do it.

175
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:32,150
Mitt Romney is wearing crazy underwear.
He's wearing magic underwear.

176
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,400
He is under his pants.
He is wearing magic underwear,

177
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,400
magic underwear,
and he believes that a convicted con man

178
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,910
got golden tablets that no one else
could see and sat with an angel to find

179
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:57,400
out that the original Jews of the Bible
were living in North America.

180
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,390
Crazy,
crazy,

181
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,950
crazy,
crazy,

182
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:07,120
crazy,
but just more modern,

183
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,450
not more crazy than other religions,
not more crazy than Islam,

184
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,020
you know,
with,

185
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:14,980
with,
uh,

186
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,060
not more crazy than virgin births.
And resurrections,

187
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,630
uh,
not more crazy than any of that stuff.

188
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,660
It fascinates me
that you can have the Bible belt and you

189
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,300
can have a court trial,
and we've seen this.

190
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm going to use it hypothetically,
but you'll know the specifics I'm

191
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,510
talking about.
I just don't want to talk about that

192
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,060
kind of pain directly.
It's too unpleasant for me.

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,310
But hypothetically,
if the Bible belt where you can have a

194
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,500
born again,
Christian judge,

195
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,720
born again,
Christian judge,

196
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,550
I believe the Bible is the literal word
of God.

197
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,710
There were talking snakes.
They were talking snakes and virgin

198
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,690
births,
burning bushes,

199
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,590
and Abraham being willing to kill his
son for God.

200
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,220
He believes that the jury is made up of
12 people who let's say 10 of them

201
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,780
believed that and to have them believe
that,

202
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:21,781
but a little less,
you're prosecuting attorney believes

203
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,901
that the people that are sitting in the
courtroom believed that these are all

204
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:33,421
people that know each other in church
and the person on the witness stand says

205
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,500
that she killed her three children in
cold blood because God told her to

206
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,140
and every single person in the courtroom
decides whether she is guilty or not

207
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,550
guilty by reason of insanity.

208
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,300
Those are the two choices they way and
nobody,

209
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,570
not the defense attorney,
not the judge,

210
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,020
not the jury people,
not the people in the gallery,

211
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,230
not one person stands up and goes,
maybe God told her to.

212
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,770
It's.
It's less weird than the talking snake.

213
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,650
Maybe God told her to and in this
country which they say over and over

214
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:26,401
again is founded on Christian values and
I'll give them that founded on Christian

215
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,550
values.
Okay,

216
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,650
it is fine.
This country founded on Christian values

217
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,800
has guilty not guilty,
not guilty by reason of insanity.

218
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,600
End of list.
There is nothing that says not guilty

219
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,690
because God told me to and why?
Why isn't that there?

220
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,770
Why isn't this country allowing them,
the court system,

221
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,930
someone to go on the witness stand and
go,

222
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,880
snake walk up to me.
Snake opened his mouth.

223
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,820
Snake said,
go into Mcdonald's.

224
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,500
Pull out an eight K,
15 killed 10 people walk back out.

225
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,470
Snake told me that it's that snake
there.

226
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,680
He's not talking anymore.
I throw myself on the mercy of the

227
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,780
court.
Aren't you all good Christians?

228
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,820
Don't you believe in the miracles of the
Bible?

229
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,150
You're seeing one now
and that's.

230
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,110
That's the part that amazes me is that
kind of stuff.

231
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:35,111
So Mitt Romney comes along and at some
level doesn't he know what he believes

232
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:41,951
is crazy at some level is any going.
Weren't Jews in North America?

233
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,030
You know that's not where the garden of
Eden was.

234
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,310
Doesn't that go through his mind?
And that's the part of that whole thing

235
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,100
that kills me.
If Mitt Romney,

236
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:03,650
he really believes what he says,
he believes he is bugged,

237
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:07,730
nutty bat shit crazy and he's not
bugged.

238
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:11,180
Nutty batshit crazy.
He's the same as Obama.

239
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,070
If Obama believes what he was being
taught in that church in Chicago,

240
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,730
okay,
he is bat shit crazy and Obama is

241
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,120
demonstrative.

242
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,130
Lee Not batshit crazy.
So we have this weird deal we make with

243
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:34,541
all the politicians where we say you can
say you believe bug nutty bat shit,

244
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,480
crazy shit,
and we'll shrug it off because you're

245
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,600
clearly not bugged.
Nutty batshit crazy.

246
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,780
And all I want out of our politicians is
for them to just say,

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,370
you know,
a lot of the religious stuff I'm talking

248
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,890
about is bugged,
duddy bad shit.

249
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:58,550
Crazy.
But I'm not because I don't think any of

250
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:03,380
these men and women are crazy and I'll
even give you Michele Bachmann.

251
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:05,900
I'll even give you a rick Perry.
I'll even give you Sarah Pailin.

252
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,140
I don't have that cynical msnbc point of
view that they are bugged,

253
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,280
nutty batshit crazy.
I think they are good people who somehow

254
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:21,281
think that their morality and their love
for humanity and their love for their

255
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:26,270
families are tied up in this weird
tradition and when they think that the

256
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,320
Bible is the word of God,
I think they mean something else.

257
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,440
I sometimes think that many other people
are speaking in a code that I've not

258
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,550
been given.
The key to.

259
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,650
When someone says to me,
I believe in the Bible literally,

260
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,440
well,
I personally pendulum read about a

261
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,710
chapter of the Bible a day.
I just read through it over and over

262
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:52,800
again,
so when someone says they believe in the

263
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:56,130
word of God,
literally I go back and think about

264
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,260
genesis where people are living to be
900 years old and I say bullshit and

265
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:05,310
then I even think about noah and the
flood killing everybody,

266
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,660
God that loves us,
kills everybody and he wants to get two

267
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:14,661
of every species and several of the ones
that are clean onto a boat that floats

268
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:19,791
for that amount of time and I just go,
because you don't act that way.

269
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,760
You're able to go to home depot.
You're able to play pay with a credit

270
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,360
card.

271
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,260
You're able to go to starbucks.
You know how to use the computer.

272
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,660
Really.
Do you really mean that?

273
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,200
What do you mean literally?
Do you really mean you're going to stone

274
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:37,920
someone to death who because they work
on the sabbath or you're really going to

275
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,050
do that?
Really honestly,

276
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,040
you're going to take a rock in your hand
and throw it in a motherfucker's head

277
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,720
because he worked on a Sunday to support
his family or you're really going to do

278
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,860
that if you mix cotton and linen and
your clothing or you're really going to

279
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:55,590
go to hell.
What do you mean when you say that?

280
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,950
And no one's ever answered me?
There's a cold going on that I need the

281
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,290
Rosetta stone.
I need someone to sit me down and go,

282
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,940
pen put.
Obama says he went to that church and

283
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,430
they talked about all this stuff being
literal.

284
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,360
What he really meant was fill in the
blank,

285
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,760
telling me what is the really mean?
These people are good on this.

286
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,780
Smart.
Not Bad shit.

287
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,560
Crazy people,
so why the fuck are they saying bad

288
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:26,910
shit?
Crazy stuff to me.
