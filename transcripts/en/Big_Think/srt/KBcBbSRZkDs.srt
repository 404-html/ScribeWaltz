1
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,400
On the last 20 years,
there have been great changes for people

2
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:15,820
with intellectual disabilities.
Many countries have passed laws that

3
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:18,470
open schools to children with
intellectual disabilities.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,110
Uh,
it's hard to believe,

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,350
but just a few generations ago,
a few decades ago,

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,140
many children with disabilities were
never allowed to go to school.

7
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,870
School's were told,
uh,

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,130
what I would tell parents,
no,

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,830
there is no place in this school for
your child.

10
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,110
So schools have opened up in some
places.

11
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:38,980
Employers have begun to see a person
with an intellectual disability as

12
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,920
someone who can contribute,
someone who will be a loyal worker,

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,640
someone who will be a reliable worker,
someone who will help create a positive

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,170
environment at work.
So employers have begun a,

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,630
the long process of opening their doors
of opportunity to people with

16
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,590
intellectual disability and healthcare
institutions have begun to study,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,660
uh,
the various forms of intellectual

18
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,990
disability and begun to respond with new
kinds of treatments,

19
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:04,960
new kinds of interventions,
new kinds of therapies that not only

20
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,770
help prevent those forms of intellectual
disability that are preventable,

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,200
but also,
and maybe more importantly add to the

22
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:15,190
quality of life of those who have an
intellectual disability and want to

23
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:16,024
contribute.

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,650
So changes have been positive in most
countries.

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,320
Do we still have work to do last?
Yes.

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,610
All the positive changes in employment
and healthcare community living

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,090
education are still unfortunately
isolated.

28
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,180
Examples,
most children with intellectual

29
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,570
disabilities never go to school more
than 90 percent,

30
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:42,571
never have a job.
Almost all of them never have real

31
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:46,900
friends.
Very few still ever get to play on a

32
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,270
sports team.
Ever get to join a community

33
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,570
organization.
Ever get to stand up in front of a crowd

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,010
and say,
look what I've done.

35
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,100
Look how well I've done.
Give me a chance at a metal.

36
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:00,340
Give me a chance at a cup,
give me a chance at success.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,410
That experience is still tragically,
uh,

38
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:08,860
the rarest of experiences in the lives
of people with intellectual disabilities

39
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:10,840
and their families.
Our job is to change that.

40
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,820
Well,
the biggest barrier facing people with

41
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:19,600
intellectual disabilities in almost
every country in the world is fear and

42
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:21,700
misunderstanding.
Negative attitudes.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,540
Uh,
people still believe that a child with

44
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,670
an intellectual disability is somehow
lesser.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,160
And so they say to parents,
so I'm sorry,

46
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,680
you have such a child,
they say to the child,

47
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,300
either in words or nonverbally,
I'm so sorry that you're having to live

48
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,270
such a tragic life.
It couldn't be in many respects a

49
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,950
further thing from the truth,
but that bias translates into a lack of

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,550
healthcare because people think,
why bother giving healthcare to these

51
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,800
children?
It translates into a lack of special

52
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:54,460
educators because people think,
why bother with special education?

53
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:58,870
We have to train and educate other kids.
It translates into a lack of employment

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,100
because people think,
why bother hiring this person?

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,760
They'll never contributed anything.
The biggest barrier is the negative

56
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,470
attitude.
The,

57
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,860
uh,
the result of negative attitudes are

58
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:15,010
whole systems,
whole social structures that too

59
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,860
frequently say to a child with
intellectual disability,

60
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,030
you are not welcome.
Our job is to reverse those negative

61
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,280
attitudes and create communities that
say,

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,740
you are welcome.
Show me what you can do.

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,260
You can contribute to the life of this
community,

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,550
to the life of this country.

65
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,100
Well,
I think the CRC is sufficient as far as

66
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,540
it goes.
It's a piece of paper.

67
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,550
It's a document.
It's a government document.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,730
The real question is not is the wording
right?

69
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,860
The real question is,
is the implementation right?

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,750
Where are the people where the armies of
citizens who will take the challenge of

71
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,730
the CRC and make it come to life?
The real urgency of now is not to have

72
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,330
signatures on the bottom of the page,
but to have people in communities who

73
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:03,331
are doing the work of overturning the
attitudes and ensuring that the rights

74
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,440
of the child with an intellectual
disability are protected.

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,270
Where the teachers who will understand
that the CRC is an invitation to them to

76
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,910
open their classrooms.
Where are the principles and the

77
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:17,110
educators who will see in the CRC a
challenge to them to make sure their

78
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:22,060
school has special educators and other
resources where the mayors and the

79
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,900
chiefs and the local officials who will
say to CRC as a challenge to my

80
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:29,170
community to become an,
an icon of acceptance,

81
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,210
to become the place where people want to
visit,

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,370
to see what it means to be inclusive.

83
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,790
This army where the parents,
the young people,

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,980
uh,
the religious leaders,

85
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,700
the civic leaders who themselves through
every little fiber of the,

86
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,760
of the community can begin to weave in
that there's a place for the person with

87
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:52,210
special needs in my church and my
synagogue in my temple,

88
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,790
in my school,
in my institution,

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,340
in my place of work,
in my home,

90
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,070
on my playground,
in my park.

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,210
When that happens,
the CRC will no longer be on paper.

92
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,400
It will be,
it will have come to life.

93
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,190
Uh,
that will be the measure of its success

94
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,360
in the moment of celebration.
