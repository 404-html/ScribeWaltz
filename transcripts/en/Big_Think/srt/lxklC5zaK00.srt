1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,660
The goal is to tell a story
that has multiple points of view for the

2
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:19,371
very reasons that we've been discussing
and two,

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,370
by doing so indicate on an artistic
level that the old idea of the single,

4
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,860
even the old idea of the single author,
if you will,

5
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,861
is flawed
because it takes ultimately many people

6
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:42,690
to tell the story of a community or the
story of a society.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,080
So that sense of the August author who
can come in and speak for women and

8
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:56,130
speak for men.
I don't believe that.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,400
Well,
maybe your imagination is sufficient.

10
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,620
Maybe not.
You know,

11
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,670
my imagination comes into play.
But before doing that,

12
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,970
I would like to know how a man feels or
how another woman feels about something.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I'm studying that because I understand
that I'm one human being with a set of

14
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:24,121
experiences that color my lens and I've
always been since I was a little girl,

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,240
very interested in how that person
across the town across the street.

16
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,410
How did they think and understanding.
I could never think likely think,

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,950
but wanting to try to do something about
that gap.

18
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,610
Not even in a humanistic way.
It was really something that bothered

19
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,860
me.
It was really something I worried about.

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,080
So first of all,
I hope that by being present as 46

21
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,621
people say in twilight a play about the
Los Angeles riots and playing a Korean

22
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:06,790
woman who's store was burned to the
ground by African Americans or playing

23
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:11,440
one of the African American kids who
beat up a white man or playing daryl

24
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:16,000
gates,
the very unpopular a chief of police

25
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,160
that it suggests to an audience that
they don't have to sit in there one

26
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,340
position.
And by the way,

27
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:25,990
you know,
when I come out at the end and take my

28
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,490
curtain call,
I'm still me.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,700
So did I really lose anything?
No fact.

30
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,120
Maybe I gained something.

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,300
Um,
aesthetically and artistically,

32
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,330
what I've been trying to contribute is
something about details that,

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,100
you know,
maybe there's a wider variety of human

34
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:56,101
beings than we've thought about and we
can tell compelling stories without

35
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:01,480
having to have those same stereotypes
that we've thinking about over and over

36
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,850
again.
Um,

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so I've been trying to contribute
something about variety that I had hoped

38
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:13,430
and I haven't succeeded,
um,

39
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,820
that I hope would change the very nature
of the way theater is produced and who

40
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:23,350
comes to the theater because the theater
is a very segregated place.

41
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,730
Most of the people who run theaters are
in this country are white people.

42
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,090
My generation had many promising
directors and producers and writers and

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,890
they're not around.
They're not making theater.

44
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,780
And it breaks my heart and I feel in
some ways that

45
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,510
I haven't contributed nearly enough in
terms of what my thought about that was

46
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:55,300
when I first was studying acting in the
theater where everybody on the stage was

47
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,250
white and everybody in the audience was
white.

48
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,650
And I thought,
that's so weird.

49
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:04,651
I'm in San Francisco.
There's Asian people up the hill.

50
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:08,710
There's black people across the bay.
There's every kind of person here.

51
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:13,711
There's Latinos all over the mission.
How could this theater of this town have

52
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,440
everybody white on the stage?
Unless it was a black guy bringing in a

53
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,930
pizza,
a character,

54
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,120
bringing the peace and everybody in the
audience is why?

55
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,190
How could that be?
So I thought,

56
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,881
well,
what made me,

57
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:28,510
if I figured out a way to bring more
colors of people onto the stage,

58
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,940
more colors of people come to the
audience.

59
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,010
That hasn't happened.

60
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,030
So you know,
I think there's so much work yet to be

61
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:47,021
done in the American theater so that it
as a cultural form can help mirror the

62
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,100
magnificent way that this country has
changed since the time I was a girl in

63
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:59,330
Baltimore,
but I just don't feel it has and it

64
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:02,240
breaks my heart.
It breaks my heart.
