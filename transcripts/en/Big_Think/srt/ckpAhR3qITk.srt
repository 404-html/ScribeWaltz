1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,650
A long time ago,
maybe three decades or so,

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,550
kids are the ones who taught us to care
about the environment.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,740
We as the adults were terribly wasteful.
We were buying hardwoods.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,710
We weren't recycling.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,980
we were just dumping things in the
rivers.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,220
We really didn't have an environmental
protection agency that was worth

7
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,170
anything.
I'm not sure if we have one that's worth

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:32,040
much today,
but we have one and so we learned and we

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,080
adjusted and so it is with really young
people today who were teaching us that

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,130
animals deserve protection.
They aren't things.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,390
They are fellows with us on the earth
and that we need to adjust our thinking

12
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,580
in the same way we did with
environmentalists,

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,990
but it happens that it is all tied
together because the whole ecology of

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,991
the earth depends on so many different
species that intermix with their roles

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,730
and keeping the earth and the air and
the water's clean and healthful.

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,340
You know,
you can go to some remote parts of

17
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:07,470
Alaska.
There are very few of them left today,

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,090
but you can and you can say,
oh look,

19
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,610
it's uninhabited,
but it's pristine.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,790
It's not uninhabited.
It's inhabited by billions upon billions

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,410
of creatures from the tiniest insect to
the wolf,

22
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,970
to the Eagle,
to the beaver.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,630
All these animals have lived there,
but they've never heard their

24
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:28,190
environment at all.
We come in with all bulldozers and our

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
heavy equipment and our oil pipelines
and everything else.

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,020
We are leaking oil.
Let's see from our ships,

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,190
we have causing the animals of the
oceans to die because of the noises of

28
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:43,080
drilling and what have you.
We have to learn that this isn't all

29
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,230
about us.
We are just ruining our own nest,

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,450
so it is a big environmental movement
and so the alignment between animal

31
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:56,451
rights and the environment should be
absolute and that doesn't even count the

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,540
what we're doing with our diet because
our diet is the most polluting water

33
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:07,851
intensive resource consuming an
occupation that we have on earth.

34
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,070
We are just deforesting take cutting
down the trees so we can make cheap

35
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:17,130
grazing land.
We are pulling the water out of the

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,190
earth so that we can grow crops and
instead of eating the crops ourselves,

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,600
we need 10 to 16 times as many crops to
feed to the animals who we ultimately

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,480
take more water to slaughter,
to transport,

39
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:33,180
and so on.
It is just a disaster.

40
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:37,410
Animal based agriculture has got to go
and sooner or later it will because the

41
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,370
water supply,
we'll,

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,870
we'll run out.
We don't think for a moment that animals

43
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,871
have more rights than human beings.
What we think is that human beings are

44
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:53,151
clever enough and moral enough to have
responsibility to the others on the face

45
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:58,020
of the earth.
So animals are never going to do the

46
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,700
things we do.
I don't know any aunts who put down

47
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,470
poison for human beings.

48
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,150
I don't know any squirrels who've
declared war in Iraq.

49
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,570
You know,
we uh,

50
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,950
the great,
uh,

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,720
override as of everything we,
we're the great decision makers about

52
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,250
everything.
And we have very,

53
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,460
very destructive for the animals take
for their need.

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,760
And we take for our greed.
You know,

55
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,690
you could reconstruct flocks of birds
and herds of cattle from just the

56
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,680
leftovers that are on the trees outside
in the car door of my hotel today,

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,280
that there's animals didn't die for any
good purpose and they didn't die.

58
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,070
Well,
they die because we fancied something

59
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,410
and we ordered more than we could ever
eat.

60
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,710
I think we need to be responsible and
Peter has a great hope that human beings

61
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,160
can be more like grownups and like big
fat,

62
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,161
greedy children and that we can look out
for the basic needs of animals,

63
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,450
which is leave me in peace.

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,130
Don't hurt me when you don't have to
choose something that's kind instead of

65
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:04,000
something that's cruel live by the
golden rule of do unto others and

66
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,610
include the animals too.
To me,

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,210
because there are billions upon
billions.

68
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:15,211
Something like $16 billion animals
killed for food every year in this

69
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,760
country alone.
That's an awful lot of individuals and

70
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:22,390
maybe a $100,
million animals killed in awful ways and

71
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:26,620
experiments every year and others use in
the circus and dissection in the

72
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:31,150
clothing industry and so on.
When I opened the paper and I see an

73
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,680
absence of coverage for all these
individuals,

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,250
then I feel that we have yet to wake up
to a core part of what's going on in the

75
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:45,940
world.
If we are to self obsessed and we have

76
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,930
to narrow in our consideration of who is
us now.

77
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,350
I saw a bumper sticker that says I am
you only different,

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,820
and I couldn't see who was driving the
car turned and afterwards I thought,

79
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,710
well actually it doesn't matter who is
driving,

80
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,090
whether it was a man or a woman,
White,

81
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,070
black,
Chinese doesn't matter.

82
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,900
And that was the message is that I am
you only different and all those

83
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:12,880
billions of individuals and it took us a
long time to even know that the people

84
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:17,650
we institutionalized where individuals
that people of other races were

85
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,220
individuals that slaves,
Africans who were brought to this

86
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,770
country.
We didn't think of them as individuals.

87
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,760
They weren't in the paper other than if
one ran away and we had to go and

88
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:32,260
retrieve all possession.
So the absence of the coverage about all

89
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:37,261
the other animals who have interests is
the biggest thing that hits me when I

90
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,374
watched the news or

91
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,010
on the paper.
