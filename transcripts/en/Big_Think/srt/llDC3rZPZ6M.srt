1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,910
Well,
New York is a lot less dangerous now,

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,910
or I perceive it as less dangerous than
it used to be.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,140
And I think it's

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,020
gotten a lot harder for people to move
here and start here.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,780
And,
uh,

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,831
I don't know,
you know,

7
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:26,260
people are always talking about the
demise of New York,

8
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,780
whether it was rotting in the 70s when I
was growing up,

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,980
or now that it's filled with hedge fund
people and artists can't afford it.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,160
So I think that New York being in the
process of failing in some way is a big

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,510
part of the city's narrative.
And it's good to know that it's still

12
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:42,340
going on just in a completely different
format.
