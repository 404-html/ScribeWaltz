1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,250
The first part of your question,
live streaming is we defined it in first

2
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,620
implemented it back in the mid 19
nineties,

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,760
um,
was a time based versus space are

4
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:22,010
surface based organization of
information.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,420
The idea was that every electronic
assets you had,

6
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:30,110
every piece of information,
whether it was an email or an instant

7
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,720
message,
whether it was a file or a spreadsheet,

8
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:37,400
whether it was a photo or an MP3,
would appear in a single time ordered

9
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:42,290
stream that mirrored the evolution of
your life.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,870
So in principle,
the first thing on the stream would be

11
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:47,540
my birth certificate and an electronic
version of that.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,960
My parents would put my records,
school records,

13
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:52,820
health records,
whatever went on that child onto the

14
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:56,690
stream.
And the Stream is um,

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,460
uh,
continues to flow forward through time.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,630
I can deal with the future is available
to me as well as the past.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,730
So I can search in the past,
find what I want.

18
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:09,790
Everything is fully indexed.
Um,

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,640
if,
if,

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,980
when I schedule things,
when I know things are coming up,

21
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:16,460
I put them in the future when I have
something that I need to return to that

22
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,440
I don't have time for now,
I put it in the future.

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,440
So,
uh,

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,130
and together with that we had an
interface,

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,830
we thought it was important not to make
use only of the surface of the screen,

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
but to uh,
present displays in depth that made use

27
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:35,030
of the other virtual depth of the
screen.

28
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:39,500
So I wasn't looking at surface,
I was more looking through a window into

29
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:42,050
an arbitrarily large information
landscape.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,710
So instead of the mouse just moving a
cursor over the surface,

31
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:50,690
it would be a robot vehicle moving
through three space or some arbitrary

32
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:51,960
space.
Um,

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,460
but the basic idea was symbol,
just a chronological timeline,

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,650
heterogeneous with absolutely everything
on it.

35
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,300
We have seen it a commercialized in two
different ways.

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,290
One way,
the one that I'm allowed to talk about

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,700
that I no longer own.
These patents,

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,650
the patents have changed hands and the
patents are now subject of enormous

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,370
lawsuit against Apple,
which is not mine because I don't own

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,380
the patent I'm told is the largest
lawsuit in patent history.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,220
Apple took these ideas.
I'm not in a position to say they stole

42
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,080
them,
I don't know if they did or not legally,

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,620
but these ideas are the basis of apples,
a cover flow of the way they display,

44
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,460
uh,
originally.

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,350
Um,
uh,

46
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:41,351
songs on itunes cover flow is now become
a standard way of displaying files on

47
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,660
virtually all apple platforms.
Spotlight,

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,730
which allows you to find files not by
name or folder,

49
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:54,560
but by content and time machine,
which is a series of,

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,680
of archive things without commenting on
the legal aspects which are not capable

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,753
of doing.

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,710
Those are,
those are live streams.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,130
And there are other companies that have
done similar things that makes me angry

54
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,170
personally,
obviously the money,

55
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:15,660
but because of the deliberate failure to
acknowledge work that,

56
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,030
that we would have made freely available
as academics.

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,290
And that,
uh,

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,300
companies nowadays will not acknowledge
because there's so much money involved.

59
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,960
The same time on the network,
there are thousands of groups that are,

60
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,850
that are building live streams or live
streaming it for themselves in their own

61
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,410
way.
We love to see this activity.

62
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,140
There's a lifestyle blog talking about
all the different life.

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,880
So,
so that's,

64
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,940
that's great.
And for that matter we're delighted to

65
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:45,370
see apple do it too.
Um,

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,770
but when there are large companies that
work on it,

67
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,400
which is also the case with,
with friend feed,

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,670
um,
with the,

69
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,990
with the event stream on facebook,
uh,

70
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,630
which,
uh,

71
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,220
which is true with the aol aol Bebo
Stream,

72
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,590
which they actually call a live stream
or live streaming.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,830
It's not,
it's not as if we want to stop that

74
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,350
activity,
shut it down,

75
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,720
but we'd like to see credit where credit
is due,

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,560
not just to me or even me mainly to me,
but to the graduate student actually

77
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,870
built the software,
worked tremendously hard,

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,850
published the papers,
put them in,

79
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,200
you know,
made them available.

80
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,060
And uh,
we'd like to see credit.
