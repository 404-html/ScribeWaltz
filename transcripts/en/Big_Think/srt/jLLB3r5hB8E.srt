1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,520
Well,
the first step,

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,550
the reason why I use the East West
paradigm is because the West has

3
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:19,711
dominated world history for 200 years
and that's been the prevailing narrative

4
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:25,660
for 200 years.
That narrative is coming to an end.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,950
So it's important to emphasize that
that's the one night is coming to an end

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,780
now the Eco,
right?

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,230
It's absolutely diverse.
She's remarkably diverse.

8
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:38,710
I mean,
China and India you mentioned are very

9
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:41,440
different,
but what most western minds don't

10
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,441
realize is that in previous centuries
there were a lot of connections among

11
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:50,180
the Asian countries.
Fairly deep connection.

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,140
To illustrate this with my Mike Best of
case,

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,860
now I'm ethnically cindy.
Cindy is a province in Pakistan and my

14
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,880
religion,
I was born a Hindu.

15
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,060
Okay.
Yet when I grew up,

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,970
the script that I learned to write with
as a Hindu,

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,110
the right cindy is the Arabic script and
it shows the connection,

18
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:14,140
the Hindu,
Cindy's halfway the Islamic world,

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,700
you know,
in Arab,

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,540
in,
in,

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,790
in,
in the Arab world and in pressure.

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,170
And at the same time when I traveled to
the East Asia,

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,590
when I go to Japan,
when I go to Korea,

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,980
when I go to China,
I still feel a sense of cultural

25
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,060
affinity because I can,
I feel like an understand the Buddhist

26
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:38,440
cultures that revealing those societies
because what does it came from India and

27
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,600
I had some Buddhists influence,
uh,

28
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,760
in my life too as a child.
So,

29
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:45,040
you know,
you can see that in my personal case,

30
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,670
if I can personally feel connected with
West Asia.

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,100
Okay.
If you personally connected with East

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,170
Asia,
that's an illustration of how Aisha

33
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,260
comes together in many ways that is not
understood by the West.

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,160
Okay.
