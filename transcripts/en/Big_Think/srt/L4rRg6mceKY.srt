1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,283
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,470
well I would say a smoking would be one,
uh,

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,940
eating to caloric excess would be
another,

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,353
um,

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,540
being sedentary,
uh,

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,540
not moving around,
not exercising would be a third.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,190
We didn't talk about exercise,
but there's ample evidence that exercise

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,960
is beneficial.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,783
Um,

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,920
I think the other thing is what we were
just talking about,

11
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,230
your attitude and mindset.
I think,

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,670
you know,
uh,

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,850
being focused on negativity would be a
fourth and I think the last one,

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,410
uh,
which again is what would be a more or

15
00:00:55,411 --> 00:01:00,180
less in this lifestyle area would be
stress level.

16
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:04,590
This level of stress that you maintain
on a day to day basis.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,220
So I believe in it.
Others a believe in something called

18
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:16,011
Hormesis
hormesis means is that a lot of stress

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
is a bad thing,
but no stress is also a bad thing and

20
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:29,481
the optimum is something in the middle
so that you're engaged on a daily basis.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,320
It revved up your functioning.
Okay.

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,000
But you feel as though you're in
control.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,540
And I think finding that balance that me
says,

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,940
uh,
is,

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
is probably very important in
maintaining a mental health and physical

26
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,450
health.
So that would be my,

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,540
my big five.
