1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,020
Well,
I started out,

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,950
I was the first gang specialist about
state of Texas.

3
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:15,290
My job was to essentially go into youth
prisons and Cellos,

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,000
young early adult prisons and deal with
the gang phenomenon that happened in the

5
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:22,630
nineties.
Job was to negotiate peace in those

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,160
environments and then furloughs,
young man out and allow them to go back

7
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:31,720
to the neighborhoods and top with your
ogs and their leaders to ask them to

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,750
give them free passage back into their
world.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,020
And you know in this culture is,
it's less now.

10
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:41,950
It's less gang.
It's more a identity with whatever,

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,990
whatever area,
whatever neighborhood,

12
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,390
whatever scenario that you.
Again,

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,630
you identify with that so that becomes
your protection.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,560
It becomes your identity,
becomes your way of life.

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,090
So someone has to figure out how to go
through that system and say,

16
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,150
let's get reality from those false
identities,

17
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:04,450
those false and so,
but you gotta be careful because no

18
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,730
matter if it's false or not,
if someone believes that they'll die for

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,320
it,
they'll kill for their live for.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,360
So you have to know how to use whatever
influence you have to bring about a

21
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,920
different perspective.
Man,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm telling,
tell you one,

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,940
once I did a a gang negotiation with the
area and brotherhood,

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,520
right?
The arrogant nation and Nazis and when

25
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,390
they gathered,
they all had to affirm their belief

26
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,790
system and it was so interested in the
guy.

27
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,090
He looked around his group and he said,
we hate blacks and we hate,

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,360
we hate you.
And he looked at me.

29
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,230
He said,
but not you,

30
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:41,800
sir.
We don't,

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,510
we don't feel like that about you.
I said,

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,030
thank you man,
because what I realized what he said to

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,690
me was,
man,

34
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:52,350
we need you right man.
So let's do this.

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,820
This,
this is not a speech that's not

36
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:57,820
necessarily interest.
And uh,

37
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,440
and that guy became one of the leaders
of this,

38
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,350
your Emoji counsel that we did in the
prison,

39
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,460
which is a unity council.

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,850
But the point I'm making is,
is that enemies calm when there is true

41
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,840
violation,
not true rhetoric.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,540
The rhetoric don't make enemies,
man.

43
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,720
It's just,
you know,

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,440
you gotta go past that.
You know,

45
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,500
that there's some stuff that I promised
you I will not say on camera that me and

46
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,720
my wife had all has argued about it and
you would think,

47
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:26,530
boy,
they are enemies.

48
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,363
No,
they just,

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,260
she didn't want to get on TV and I don't
want to,

50
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,790
you know,
and it just got out of her hand.

51
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,740
So sometimes you have to go beyond the
rhetoric so you can see the real and

52
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,930
they're so,
so you got to classify a person with

53
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,400
enemy,
with their intent,

54
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,830
with that consistent behavior.
And it's,

55
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,420
it's a whole,
you know,

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,840
it's a whole broad range when you try to
deal like that.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,370
And so you have to be very,
very,

58
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,370
very careful when you're doing it
because you never know who you're going

59
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,290
to need on many,
many,

60
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,010
many sides.

61
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,920
So that's how I see enemy.
So you right about that.

62
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,140
It's very rather than my spirit,
I would say,

63
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,260
as an enemy because when you can't do
the inner work,

64
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,094
good,
I do,

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,790
you will be.
You will really limit your influence and

66
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,700
limit your access if you thought in
those terms.

67
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,451
So,
uh,

68
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,010
you know,
I did work with Paul Ryan,

69
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,870
he was doing the poverty tool,
uh,

70
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,431
on,
uh,

71
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,990
with,
with someone with a mentor,

72
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,160
my mentor,
Bob Woodson,

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,790
and it was called what works and why,
and he was going around and see what

74
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,630
really works and he had this idea called
a better way forward.

75
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,690
And so they came to Dallas.
I had no knowledge of him.

76
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:33,640
He came to Dallas to come see my work
and one of his first trips when he

77
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:38,020
became speaker of the house was I do a
big celebration every mlk.

78
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,700
They've where outbrain healers from all
over the city of Dallas then,

79
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,650
but now all over the nation,
they came together,

80
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,180
suggests,
affirmed what we were doing and to read,

81
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,440
you know,
revisit where we were.

82
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,500
One of his first trips,
he came there and was that strictly

83
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,000
listened.
He stayed for a few hours just listening

84
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,820
to everyone and talking in,
in there in that space.

85
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,500
And it was so interesting how the
perception was not the reality,

86
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,800
because most people who work in
neighborhoods,

87
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,770
you know,
they have a philosophy that will say it

88
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,490
own,
lean it on lean toward where you are

89
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,890
fall.
But he was as comfortable in that moment

90
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,891
as I was when he brought us up to talk
to a group of guys who are

91
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,860
conservatives.
And uh,

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,250
we,
we did a deal at the American Enterprise

93
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,190
Institute and other places where we were
just trying to share our ideas.

94
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,490
And what we saw when we started
realizing is there's not a lot of

95
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,700
separation and the separation is very
small.

96
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,540
And so,
um,

97
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,410
we began to just work in that in that
sense.

98
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,850
Yeah.
You know,

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,300
perspective comes from where you are.
I never forget when Paul and I first

100
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,120
met,
I was saying,

101
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,270
what is he,
what is he trying to gain from this?

102
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,990
And um,
and,

103
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,870
and his direct answer was inflammation.
I don't know what I don't know.

104
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:02,560
So teach,
show me what it means to be in this

105
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,300
moment.
And then I'm going to show you who I am.

106
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,550
And then he said something that's very
powerful.

107
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,810
He said,
Omar,

108
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,030
there are people who are poised to help
you,

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,770
that you wouldn't,
you wouldn't meet,

110
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,010
but I won't.
I want to introduce you to this world.

111
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,350
And I'm skeptical because I'm working in
the streets saying right,

112
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,810
anybody who won't help me,
I pretty much know and I was wrong.

113
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,680
So we met at a vulnerable place where we
both could learn.

114
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,150
And the power of that relationship is
that we didn't have to start hiding from

115
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,720
real issues to work together.
Uh,

116
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,900
uh,
Charles Koch says something that was so

117
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,610
strong to me.
He said,

118
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,200
what do we fiercely agree upon?
And less work like hell to make it

119
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,730
happen.
Sounds like that.

120
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,850
Where do we fiercely agree up also there
we really agreed that everyone wants to

121
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:50,684
be a citizen.
Yeah.

122
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,280
Do we really agreed that that poverty
should not be the destination.

123
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,070
It could be a transportation,
but yet do we really agree that,

124
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,070
that anyone can transform the transform
transformation?

125
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,940
Yeah.
Redemption yet.

126
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,480
So we just started figuring out what we
agree upon and it was easy to have real

127
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,720
relationship.
So Paul then for me,

128
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,400
it was not political,
it was,

129
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,880
it was real.
And then when we had real disagreements,

130
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,500
they were coming from a pure place.

131
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,920
Paul,
I'm agree with his policy.

132
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,311
He said,
yeah,

133
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,300
well my scoop it and we didn't have any
heartburn.

134
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,890
We had true,
uh,

135
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:25,100
ideas that could,
that could play out in the theater ideas

136
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,360
and see what happens.
But,

137
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,900
but,
but the goal was bigger than the roles

138
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,340
it was not us trying to figure this
thing out.

139
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,640
So it stopped being this conversational
priests.

140
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,150
We figuring out how we played a game
with each other.

141
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,340
It started really being,
do we do,

142
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,370
do we add value to each other in all we
solving things that other people run a

143
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,420
way from and this in this environment of
us versus them,

144
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,090
right?
Versus left red vs blue,

145
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,320
a blue,
uh,

146
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,370
you know,
all of those things create the most,

147
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,270
um,
echo chamber life that you can have.

148
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,690
And it is,
it's going to have major consequences

149
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,940
when you really have to solve deep
problems.

150
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,410
You cannot solve problems that way.
That's it.

151
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,930
That's insane.
You can't do that.
