1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,610
Well,
I think fashion has gotten to a point

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,350
where it's sort of like mini Hollywood,
you know,

3
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,190
it's,
it's,

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,050
it's actress light.
Uh,

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,580
it's,
it's mellow drama,

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:18,760
small.
It's a,

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,430
you know,
it's a sitcom.

8
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,810
It's not the full length feature movie.
It's fashioned,

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,280
provides a certain drama.
It's got the ego,

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,130
it's got the beauty,
it's got the glamor that Hollywood has.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,340
Um,
and because it's not,

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,730
know we can't get in behind Meryl
Streep's dressing room.

13
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,740
We can't get backstage at the filming of
that.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,650
We can't see when camera,
um,

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,190
uh,
who was just on,

16
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,220
um,
Charlie just did a nude scene and they

17
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:47,550
did it at night and 4:00 in the morning
because they didn't want anyone to know

18
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,530
and only the director and Charlene's new
and Duh,

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,800
Dah,
Dah,

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,031
Dah,
Dah,

21
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:50,660
Dah,
Dah.

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,890
Um,
uh,

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,640
we can't get behind the scenes on that.
You can't do that.

24
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,860
The celebs won't let you do that.
Hollywood won't allow us.

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,850
So,
you know,

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,120
fashion sort of Hollywood light on some
level and you can get into a bit of the

27
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:06,390
drama and the Glamor and the beauty that
Hollywood provides.

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,780
Um,
and there's also,

29
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:08,571
you know,
a lot of Ecos,

30
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:09,850
so you get it,
you get a little bit of the,

31
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,520
uh,
you a little bit of the storyline as

32
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,354
well.

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,850
They've got to look great and that's
their image.

34
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:17,140
And similarly,
you know,

35
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,700
John Galleano made it out of the,
you know,

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,500
the slight obscurity when,
you know,

37
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,560
his dresses were worn by,
you know,

38
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,430
actresses on the catwalk,
uh,

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,680
on the red carpet.
I mean,

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
um,
so,

41
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:29,620
you know,
it's a great symbiotic relationship.

42
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:33,790
Actresses need to look glamorous,
they need to be photographed and

43
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,240
similarly,
designers want to keep their street cred

44
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,060
with the general public who's watching
the Oscars,

45
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,850
who's watching all these celebs,
reading all the weeklies,

46
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:46,510
looking at all of the online sites to
see what they're wearing when they go

47
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:48,180
out,
when they go to award ceremonies.

48
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,970
So,
you know,

49
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,420
the Hollywood end fashion has gotten
into bed together.

50
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:54,550
Um,
and it's working nicely actually for

51
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,384
both of them.

52
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm always riveted by Madonna,
you know,

53
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:03,420
she continues to more,
even at age 50,

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,480
51.
Uh,

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,440
she was backstage at Marc Jacobs.
He had address,

56
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,780
you know,
slightly speechless because I think

57
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,810
she's got great style.
Um,

58
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,030
and if not,
she's got unbelievable balls to have the

59
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:16,890
style that she wants to have when she
wants to have it.

60
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,550
So I think she's someone that I've
always found to be interesting.

61
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,180
Um,
I think occasionally Katie Holmes has

62
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,300
had great personal style,
is kind of gracious in the way she gets

63
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,890
dressed.
Uma Thurman was a model.

64
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,920
I love her style all the time.
She looks just great in clothes.

65
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,930
Um,
you know,

66
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:37,440
beyonce is sexy and beautiful and route
and I love the way she looks too.

67
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm very,
very different.

68
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:41,800
Yeah,
well,

69
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,810
I think of a generation.
The blogs are,

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,090
um,
I'd like to consider ours the cut,

71
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:46,751
which is,
you know,

72
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,910
going through the roof and it's record
breaking numbers,

73
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,060
um,
during New York fashion week last week

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,350
that people are coming more to the blogs
and good smart ones that have a point of

75
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,860
view that tell them the news that
synthesize it also a bit of a,

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,300
you know,
cutting edge,

77
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,640
shall we say,
not to,

78
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,360
to,
to use the part of cut.

79
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,060
Uh,
uh,

80
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,580
I think that's a generational change
that,

81
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:13,450
that really is happening.
I don't think the celebrities are in

82
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,600
general,
um,

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,570
you know,
I think the Olson's have great style and

84
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,410
that's an exception to the rule.
Um,

85
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,110
and they're also doing a great line of
clothing,

86
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:23,280
kind of cool classics called the row.
Um,

87
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,101
but in general,
no,

88
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,210
I think it comes from the designers.
They're the ones that set the trends.

89
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:32,710
They're the ones that create the desire,
create the passion,

90
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:37,711
create the whole aura around what you
want to get or where or see in any given

91
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,290
season.
Um,

92
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,330
and fashioned traditionally goes from,
you know,

93
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,710
you're too young,
you know,

94
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,140
last fall,
this fall it was about eighties and

95
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:51,370
leather and tight and sequence and
shoulders on belts or forties and more

96
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:54,250
conservative version of that same
silhouette.

97
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,530
And for spring so far it's very
romantic.

98
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:01,210
It's quite loose normous amount of
texture to fabrics and ruffles or pearls

99
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,820
or rushing or bright strong color things
that are very eye-popping.

100
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,720
So again,
you're seeing the antithesis of what

101
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,050
came before.
Um,

102
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,730
fashion designers tend to be tired of
what they've just seen for six months

103
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,440
and they want something completely
different and fresh.

104
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,900
So if you,
if you,

105
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,520
if you see a season of black,
you can bet that the next season's going

106
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,170
to be white.
If you see a season where it's short and

107
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,240
tight,
you can sort of put your money on,

108
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,530
it might be long and lives um,
or looser and slightly more poetic and

109
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:27,364
it's point of view.

110
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,410
I,
I think the designer today that really

111
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:37,940
designs for women,
um,

112
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,600
that's leading the pack on that.
With that in mind,

113
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,090
um,
is Alvera Barabbas for law va.

114
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,690
I think his ability to design his
technique,

115
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,980
his technique,
his,

116
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:52,430
his,
his literal ability to design a dress

117
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:54,970
and know how to technically do that is
um,

118
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,420
got many peers.
I think Alabama really understands a

119
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,640
woman.
I think he understands not only her

120
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,320
body,
but her psyche,

121
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,320
how she wants to be alluring,
how she wants to feel.

122
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,050
Um,
I think he's really entered into that

123
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:11,960
space and I therefore,
I think he designs with that in mind

124
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,790
along with an unbelievable technical
ability to make perfectly beautiful

125
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,260
clothing,
um,

126
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,290
seem effortless and have a great ease
and sensuality that's very,

127
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,340
very,
very accomplished and very difficult to

128
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:28,100
come by.
So I would have to give my stars to the

129
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:31,370
man with the most style or ability to
create that style.

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,040
Ultimately,
a woman's got to have that style because

131
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,570
she's putting on something that somebody
made.

132
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:38,180
And I think,
I think alvero elbaz would be my vote

133
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:38,560
for today.
