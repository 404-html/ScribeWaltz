1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,910
I love thinking about leveraging the
laws of likability when giving feedback,

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,450
because feedback is only effective if
somebody can receive it,

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,340
so you want to present feedback.
I say on a silver platter and not on a

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,240
garbage can.
Lid,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,030
you have to remember it's not about your
communication style,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,890
it's about there's the best way to
develop your people is to flex to them,

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,120
to empower them to adapt your style to
what they need.

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,800
That's a manager,
that's a leader,

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,820
that's a coach,
so if there's somebody who really likes

10
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,500
direct feedback,
even if it's something you're not

11
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,500
comfortable with,
they will respect and be able to take it

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,630
in better.
If you can just get to the point,

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,120
if you're somebody who's really
directing,

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,090
they need a little bit more tact and
diplomacy,

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,720
then you're going to need to massage
your messaging.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,850
So again,
it can be heard.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,410
There's a correlation between the speed
at which somebody receives that feedback

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,480
and the importance that they place on
it.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,190
When you delay feedback,
you delayed the value you're placing on

20
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,100
it.
So immediacy is important.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,700
Now,
not in the exact moment.

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,610
Let them have a moment to breathe,
but don't wait more than a day if you

23
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:16,130
can.
If it's really crucial you had that

24
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:19,670
weekly meeting,
sometimes it will fade from your memory.

25
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,550
By that point it becomes less important
to you and to them,

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,710
so make sure you give that feedback
quickly and specifically,

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,570
don't just say,
oh,

28
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:33,710
I think it went well.
Tell them why you thought it went well,

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,050
what specifically they did that you
thought went well,

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,150
and then challenge them with the next
opportunity.

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,250
Give them something to keep growing
from.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,550
So if you think about the most important
law of likability,

33
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,930
it's law of curiosity,
and I have a model that you can walk

34
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:52,220
through any challenging or feedback
conversation that will leverage these

35
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,120
laws of likability.

36
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,110
Starting with curiosity,
curiosity creates connections and

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,800
connection is important in these
conversations because when you receiving

38
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,020
feedback,
you're considering your source and when

39
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,870
you don't value trust or like the
source,

40
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,810
then you might not be really willing to
take that information in.

41
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,220
So the model is four parts.
Ask,

42
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,780
elaborate,
empower.

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,260
Collaborate.
Ask is going to leverage that law of

44
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:21,230
curiosity.
Start with a question and make sure that

45
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,840
question is open ended.
It's not,

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,510
you know,
do you think that went well,

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,690
which is implying that you don't think
that went well.

48
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,320
Instead you asked,
how do you think it went?

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,790
What do you think went well?
What do you think could've gone better

50
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,080
and get them talking.
That's the key to opening up a feedback

51
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,360
conversation.
It's get the information from them.

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
It actually makes it easier on you as a
manager because you see where they're

53
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,280
at,
what they already know.

54
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,890
They're bringing information in the room
and you can determine,

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,810
oh,
we're about on the same page,

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,970
or we have completely different views of
the situation and that will help kind

57
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,720
tweak the information that you need to
bring into the room.

58
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Oftentimes people are much harder on
themselves than you'll ever be on them.

59
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,140
The next love likability is the most
important thing.

60
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,340
You have to listen,
so listen for the understanding,

61
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,310
listened for the concern,
listened for a different view,

62
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,020
interpretation of the situation,
because we know we're coming in with a

63
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,560
belief about what happened.
We need to try to check that assumption

64
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,500
at the door and listen for other
possibilities,

65
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,170
other narratives.
Alright,

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,820
so we've asked.
We've listened.

67
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,340
Now it's your turn.
As the manager ask,

68
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,670
elaborate.
This is your chance to add information

69
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,920
that you might've heard collected from
other sources.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Be additive.
Don't say,

71
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,980
well,
I heard.

72
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,610
Instead you'll say,
additionally,

73
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,120
I received information from so and so
and this and that,

74
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,090
and you're bringing in that information,
my perspective of,

75
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,500
and it could be elevating them.
Feedback isn't always negative.

76
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,170
You don't have to brace them and you
don't have to brace yourself.

77
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,880
Feedback is simply information and it's
information that you want to make

78
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,060
somebody able to use and put into
action.

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,510
So that is the first half of the
conversation.

80
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,510
Before you move onto the second half,
what I want you to think about our root

81
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,630
causes,
what are the root causes and the reasons

82
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,240
that it went so well.
What are the root causes and the reasons

83
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:23,140
that it didn't go so well.
Is there something that's underlying

84
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,180
that can help us in the second half of
this conversation,

85
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,710
what we're looking for,
the solutions?

86
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,670
Did you not have training?
Did you not have authority?

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,220
Did you not have budget?
What happened?

88
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,670
Let's evaluate that before we move on.
Now you're going to throw back to the

89
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,380
other person.
You're going to empower them,

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,790
get them to throw the ideas out of what
they think the next step should be,

91
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,970
so what would you do differently next
time?

92
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,900
Or how do you think we can move forward
from here are great questions to start

93
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:57,460
the empower phase
as we empower them and bring those

94
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,890
ideas.
You have to be very careful at that last

95
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,130
stage of the conversation where you're
collaborating because as the manager,

96
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:05,680
as the leader,
when you put your idea out there,

97
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,820
they're just going to defer,
so builds off of their ideas.

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,460
I love that.
I think in addition,

99
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,740
you could also do this or maybe even
switched the order.

100
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,970
What do you think?
The collaboration isn't a dictation.

101
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,100
The collaboration is the exchange.

102
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,760
Now,
another key thing that can happen in

103
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,000
that last phase of the feedback,
especially when things might not have

104
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,600
gone the way that you wanted,
is to leverage the law of similarity

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,980
by sharing experience that you went
through that might be similar to what

106
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,740
they're experiencing.
You create a teachable moment.

107
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,470
You build trust.
When you're vulnerable with your

108
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,960
employees,
you actually increase your credibility,

109
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,950
so remember,
vulnerability is not about weakness.

110
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,090
It's about openness,
so share the story of how when things

111
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,070
didn't go so well for you,
what you did,

112
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,200
what you learned,
how it went,

113
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,590
and let them know it's okay.
We all make mistakes and we can still

114
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:05,510
get to the positions that you're in,
and the last thing to remember is the

115
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,830
law of likability called mood memory
because if they walk away from that

116
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,650
conversation not feeling good,
they're going to want to throw out all

117
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:13,970
of the information that they've
received.

118
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,640
So mood memory is that people remember
more how you make them feel that

119
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:24,500
anything that you said,
so ensure that you are being action

120
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:28,670
oriented.
Feedback is not about berating somebody

121
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,690
or punishing.
We focus on the past to make a plan for

122
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,430
the future.
That's feedback.
