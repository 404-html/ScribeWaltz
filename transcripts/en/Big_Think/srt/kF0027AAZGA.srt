1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,930
That's how would be here for who you
pretend that you know,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,310
but you don't know believe you really
have to disagree with you.

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:10,740
I spend a lot of time with the stock.
Open minded.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,630
You are not

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,770
this your Carlson,
what happened to you man used to be

6
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:18,590
affable,
used to be friendly.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,080
You used to wear a nice time.
Now you wear bibs and I don't know.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,660
So I don't know what happened to you
man,

9
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:31,661
but I want you to consider that uh,
from the scientific perspective,

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,720
pick the number you like 97% of the
world's scientists,

11
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,530
very close to 100% of the world.
Scientists are very concerned about

12
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:44,531
climate change.
And so why aren't some people concerned

13
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:49,721
about it when media outlets were allowed
to be consolidated and the 1980s then it

14
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:58,160
developed these two factions like that.
I don't remember it having a,

15
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:02,250
and by that I think two factions or a
normal course of events where you,

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,900
you have males and females,
your boys and girls,

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,290
whether it's fruit flies or dandelions
or you and me and in the World Cup

18
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,540
soccer,
you end up with two teams.

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,520
The World Series Baseball,
you end up with two teams.

20
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:20,960
It's really hard to have three teams.
And so I think and we to two political

21
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:24,950
parties normally.
So somebody who understands this better

22
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,020
than I do,
who may observe that the media have

23
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:32,021
divided into two camps.
But from our point of view in the

24
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:37,100
science and engineering side,
you got to respect the facts at some

25
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:40,400
level.
You got to respect their scientifically

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:45,401
provable.
And then speaking of authorities and

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,770
mistrust of authorities,
the crowd on a,

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,610
at the inauguration,
I was objective,

29
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,520
we smaller crowd than the crowd the next
day at the women's March.

30
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:59,300
So when you,
if someone asserts that the crowd is

31
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,000
bigger when it was curly,
smaller than everything else here she

32
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:06,980
says subject to question and this has
led to a lot of trouble.

33
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,361
So,
uh,

34
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:12,290
I think though that built into the u s
government,

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,100
which includes the first amendment of
the bill of rights,

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,610
the freedom of the press built in is
change.

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,260
So I'm very hopeful and optimistic that
things will change.

38
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:29,261
That my understanding is subscriptions
to so called mainstream media,

39
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:34,100
Washington Post New York Times.
And so on and have gone up in response

40
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:38,330
to these,
to this approach to objective truths.

41
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,000
So that will probably be to the good,
uh,

42
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,930
but how are fast,
what happened and what will go wrong.

43
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,250
In the meantime it says these are big
questions and then as far as my thing

44
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,290
with Mr. Carlson,
I don't know,

45
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,860
he used to not interview that way.
He used to not just talk about it

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,810
because it's unknowable.
Okay.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,940
It takes you quite a bit less than six
seconds.

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,680
I go back again in a second.
Mr. Carlson,

49
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,830
do you have me on again?
I will come right back on.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,730
Bring it on man.
And you know what else Mr. Carlson,

51
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:18,731
I'll bet you $10,000 that 2010 2020 will
be the hottest decade on record.

52
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,830
I offered a bed of $10,000 to Joe
Bastardi who is a Fox News contributor

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,490
and Marc Morano who I'm not sure as a
contributor,

54
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,490
but used to appear on your station
routinely.

55
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:36,230
You're a network routinely.
I bet them each 10,000 bucks,

56
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,500
2010 2020 will be the hottest decade on
record.

57
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,560
I bet them each another 10th.
Oh,

58
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,570
did I say 20 10,000 bucks on the decade?
10,000 Bucks on the year 2016 2016 would

59
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:53,060
have been among the top 10 hottest years
on record.

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,220
Uh,
wait,

61
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:58,610
there's more.
2016 was the hottest year on record.

62
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,180
And your guys,
the people that Fox News here to forest

63
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,070
supports in this would not take either
bet.

64
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:10,430
$40,000 wouldn't take the bet.
It could have been theirs.

65
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,840
I'm good for it.
