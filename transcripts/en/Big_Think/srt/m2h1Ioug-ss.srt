1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,290
I would define compassion in a nutshell,
as a natural sense of concern that

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:16,291
arises in us in the face of someone who
was a need or someone who's in pain and

3
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:21,361
accompanied by a kind of a wishing to
see the relief or end of that situation

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,640
and wanted to do something about it.
So it's compassionate.

5
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:29,641
It's not just an emotional reaction.
There is also a more motivational kind

6
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,000
of element which makes us want to do
something about the situation.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,550
One of the interesting thing about our
contemporary modern society is that I'm

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,160
given the highly competitive nature of
society and also the way in which we're

9
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:48,430
bringing up our children and the way in
which we ourselves grew up,

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,820
which involved huge amount of evaluation
and judgment and comparison across with

11
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:56,920
others from a very early age.
Um,

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,160
we have kind of internalized a certain
kind of way of being in the world and

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,320
perceiving our relationship with others.

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,390
And that dynamic has created a certain
kind of,

15
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,570
you know,
inhibitions against our natural

16
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,700
compassionate instinct.
So,

17
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:19,420
and these inhibitions really take
primarily in the form of fear.

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,130
So for example,
many people worry and I'm afraid that if

19
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:28,810
they are too kind and compassionate,
that other people will take advantage of

20
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,970
them.
They will see them as pushover or weak

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,160
or losers.
So that's one type of fear that we

22
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:39,130
bring.
I'm not the type of fear that we bring

23
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:39,990
is that,
um,

24
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,900
you know,
because in popular understanding of

25
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,780
compassion,
it's so dominated by compassion as an

26
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:49,720
emotion,
kind of a soft heart and tender heart

27
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:53,470
and so on.
So people worry that if they allow their

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,540
compassionate and kinder instinct to
become more dominant in their way of

29
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,030
interacting with the world and others,
you know,

30
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,540
somehow it might undermine their more
rational,

31
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,340
tougher aside so that they may not be
able to succeed in the life and compete.

32
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,820
That's another type of fear.
And then sometimes,

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,320
uh,
in intimate relations that particularly

34
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,220
between parents and children on the part
of the parents,

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,570
sometimes we also worry that if we were
to kind to our children,

36
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,730
you know,
we might be spoiling them,

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,690
you know,
we,

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,160
they might become overdependent up on us
and then somehow we will end up having

39
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:34,900
to do everything for them.
So these are various types of fear that

40
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:39,070
we bring into our expression of natural
compassionate instinct.

41
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,120
And a lot of these are subconscious
biases that we bring.

42
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,490
You know,
people may not necessarily sit down and

43
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:49,180
think that's what I'm going to do,
but these are culturally acquired

44
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:54,181
sensibilities and biases,
which also makes us suspicious when

45
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,010
someone has been kind to us
compassionate towards us,

46
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,250
we start one wondering,
there must be hidden agenda,

47
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,440
you know,
that that person must want something

48
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,800
from me.
So it's,

49
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:07,890
I'm very unfortunate.
These are various forms of culturally

50
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:12,891
acquired fear that really undermines the
expression of what is really natural to

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,620
our human being,
which is the ability to connect with

52
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,970
someone and the ability to relate to
that person at a deeper level and have a

53
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:24,820
much more open heart hearted kind of
interaction.
