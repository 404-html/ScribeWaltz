1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,720
I grew up primarily in suburban New
Jersey,

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,140
not far from New York City.
My parents worked.

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,770
And I think I'm very much a product of
the middle class to upper middle class

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,540
suburban environment that I grew up in
a,

5
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:28,250
in an environment in which a achievement
in school and achievement in,

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,460
uh,
the professional world beyond school

7
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:32,240
were,
you know,

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,360
very,
very high values.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,360
Uh,
and uh,

10
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:38,420
I think that,
you know,

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,910
shaped me a tremendous list.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,600
I usually say that I got into journalism
because the family business,

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,930
uh,
my parents met when they were the

14
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:59,630
success of editors of the undergraduate
newspaper at Nyu where they were both a

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,890
commuter students.
Um,

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,150
my father went on to spend his entire
career in journalism primary with the

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,760
late great,
uh,

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,790
New York Herald Tribune and then for 35
years at Time magazine.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,930
So I grew up carrying a little reporters
pad and pencil in my pocket,

20
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,660
just imitating my father and as a child.
For me,

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,590
a big adventure was to come into the
city from New Jersey to visit him at the

22
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,130
time and life building and send messages
through the old pneumatic tubes.

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,190
And Play Ping Pong in the hallway with
the other journalists,

24
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,040
people who I thought were these exotic
cookie off the wall people.

25
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,770
And I thought it was just the coolest
thing in the world that my father worked

26
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,840
with these people.
Uh,

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,460
so as a kid,
I just assumed I was going to become a

28
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:42,560
journalist because that's what people
did when they got older.

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,480
[inaudible].
