1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,660
Yeah,
oftentimes when people talk about sacred

2
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:12,860
texts for many people,
that sort of thing that you say to show

3
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,310
how serious you are is,
well,

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,153
you know,
we take it,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,670
we take it literally,
but that actually has caused an

6
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,470
extraordinary amount of destruction in
the world.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,833
So I,
uh,

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,150
I began with,
I try to take it literally.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,790
So if it's a poem,
it's a poem and if it's a letter who

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:35,060
wrote it and when did they write it and
who are they writing it to?

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,270
What was the world like at that time,
if it was history,

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,690
but the writer is kind of winking along
the way,

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,670
like this is what I'm really saying.
Then you take it with that subtlety and

14
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:54,671
nuance and even humor.
So all religious texts have to be

15
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:58,700
interpreted.
And the really dangerous thing is when

16
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:01,010
someone says,
I'm not giving you my opinion,

17
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:06,011
I'm just telling you what it says,
because that's actually their opinion.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,220
If you deny human agency,
it generally leads to some sort of

19
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,830
oppression or exploitation.
So,

20
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,170
uh,
everything gets way more interesting

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,210
when you start reading it,
literally because you then don't have to

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,550
do those awkward explanations.
Um,

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,910
one of my,
one of the greatest examples of this is

24
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,000
there's this ancient story about Jonah
who gets swallowed by a fish.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,480
I'm not a whale of fish.
Um,

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,000
the counselor says in the ancient texts,
and so the question often becomes a

27
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,060
debate about whether or not a guy really
got swallowed by a fish and you have the

28
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:40,250
literalist going,
it says he got swallowed by a fish,

29
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,500
he got swallowed by a fish.
And then you have the others going.

30
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,990
No,
it's a larger metaphor.

31
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,570
But what's interesting is the story
begins.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,180
The Assyrians were the worst neighbors.
They were the cruel oppressors who had

33
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,740
made life miserable.

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,630
And so this man,
Jonah is told,

35
00:01:56,631 --> 00:02:00,710
go and bless Nineveh.
Nineveh was the capital of Syria.

36
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,700
So the story begins with a man being
told,

37
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,690
go bless your worst,
most heinous enemy.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,350
And uh,
he doesn't.

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,230
He goes the other direction.
He runs away,

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,270
which I think the original audience
would have cheered this man Jonah on

41
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,190
you.
You go the other direction,

42
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,100
whatever you do,
don't go bless the person who has made

43
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:29,000
your life a living hell.
So he eventually gets on a boat.

44
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,030
There's a storm,
he's thrown over board and he's

45
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,850
swallowed by a fish.
I think the power of the story is not

46
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,010
arguing about whether or not he was
swallowed by a fish.

47
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,220
I think the story was told to a group of
people to confront them with how they

48
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,350
cannot forgive their worst enemy.
And will the past and the wounds that

49
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:52,070
you have suffered,
define you and hold you back.

50
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,730
Or can you forgive?
Um,

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,060
can you move towards your enemy,
not with violence but with love.

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,910
Do the things that have happened to us
define us or is there a love that can

53
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,590
transcend even this?
So this would be a classic example to me

54
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,930
where there's an ancient texts and the
story where you can,

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,690
in your attempt to,
uh,

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,200
defend it,
literally actually avoid the more

57
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,500
interesting questions of the heart that
I think are the questions the

58
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,580
storyteller is trying to get at.
And yes,

59
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,630
in our world to this day,
taking some of these texts literally has

60
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,410
caused so much violence.
Um,

61
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,250
you read the ancient texts,
you also use your mind,

62
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,370
um,
you listen for what new thing might be

63
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:47,371
happening in the world.
You read it as a fully orbed experience

64
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,810
and then it actually gets quite
inspiring.
