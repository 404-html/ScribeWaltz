1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,590
Mm.
It doesn't take long.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,420
When you start to develop a practice of
mindfulness before you realize that we

3
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:18,460
are virtually continually bombarded by
thoughts.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,560
It's the,
I like weather patterns in the mind.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,440
The legs said there are some times like
nice clear sunny days,

6
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,330
but there are an awful lot of cloudy
days,

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,700
tumultuous days,
rainy days,

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,030
turbulent,
stormy weather.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,650
And again,
challenges.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,370
How are we to be in relationship to all
of that stuff that's driving our lives

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,180
and our narrative of who I am.
And,

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,600
and so,
um,

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,750
when
you

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,290
get in touch with
what awareness really is,

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,250
then you're,
the first thing you realize is that

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,340
those thoughts are not me and they're
not mine.

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,780
They're just like weather patterns.
Yeah.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,750
Impersonal weather patterns in the mind.
So then you can observe them like a

19
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,680
scientist.
Like

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,120
what is the nature of this thought?
Where does it come from?

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,690
I mean,
then they come like bullets,

22
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,820
you know,
fired out of a machine gun there very,

23
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:27,110
very fast,
so to speak.

24
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:30,170
That's a quite militaristic image.
But you know,

25
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:35,060
another way is bubbles coming off the
bottom of a pot of boiling water.

26
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,370
You know,
if you've ever watched a pot of boiling

27
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,720
water,
uh,

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,240
say a glass pot,
the,

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,680
the bubbles tend to nucleate at the
bottom and then they go through the

30
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:50,681
water and they go poof at the surface.
So the thoughts are very similar and

31
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:54,410
that's when I use another,
uh,

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,490
people often use this term,
the thoughts self liberate.

33
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,460
You don't have to get rid of them.
People misunderstand meditation is,

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,410
Oh,
I just sweep all my thoughts away and

35
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:08,360
then I'm in this like Nirvana.
What you'll get by trying to sweep all

36
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:12,850
your thoughts away is a headache at the
most because there's no way to sweep

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,410
your thoughts away.
They will get you every time.

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,020
Uh,
and then you can have millions of

39
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:22,250
thoughts about mindfulness and
meditation and those are just thoughts

40
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,630
too.
They're not meditating.

41
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,630
But when you see that you're not your
thoughts,

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,570
then you can watch them in this kind of
impersonal,

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,630
more sort of,
if you will,

44
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,160
observing way with kindness,
with self compassion,

45
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:40,580
because a lot of them are heavily loaded
with negative emotion.

46
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,810
And you can see that if you don't touch
them,

47
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,430
if you don't do anything with them,
if you don't get caught in the them,

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,060
they self liberate naturally in
awareness,

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,850
the awareness,
it's like touching a soap bubble.

50
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,210
You know it's fun for kids and fun for
adults.

51
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,100
Soap bubble and you touch it and it just
goes.

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,880
Okay.

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,820
So I love that image.
So like let the thought is the soap

54
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,700
bubble and the emotion too.
That's you know,

55
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,930
balancing the thought and you don't need
to anything with it because your

56
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:17,210
awareness,
it's like if not even a finger,

57
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:19,640
it's not corporeal,
the awareness,

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,640
just the embracing of it or the arising
of it.

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,300
Like in the sky it goes poof all by
itself.

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,590
And don't take my word for it.
This is something that when you sit down

61
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:34,070
and you begin to watch,
you'll see this is not rocket science.

62
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:36,260
You can,
if you don't have to sit in a cave for

63
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,150
30 years to have that kind of
experience,

64
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,090
well you need to do is in some sense get
out of your own way.

65
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,030
Now I'm not saying that it's easy,
that's really hard.

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,820
But if you can have moments when you get
out of your own way,

67
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:51,821
then you'll see that a lot of this stuff
that we get so caught up and it's like

68
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,170
it's a mirage.
And that doesn't mean that the thoughts

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,180
aren't valuable.
I mean,

70
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,200
I think it was Einstein who said,
you know,

71
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,010
if you have one or two really good
thoughts in a lifetime,

72
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,030
you are ahead of the curve.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,590
Paraphrasing.
Uh,

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,100
so most of our thoughts are actually
kind of mundane or imprisoning,

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,270
but thinking is a ferry ferry.
I mean it drives imagination,

76
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,800
drives creativity.
So maybe we need to just create a bigger

77
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,740
arena for our thoughts and watch how
they,

78
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:30,880
not only self liberate,
but also inform each other in some

79
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,560
sense.
And then all of a sudden you see

80
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,490
something that no one in the history of
humanity is seen

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,833
before

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,460
and you were apprehended

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,800
because you're making your,
or your something is being revealed to

84
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:49,970
you.
I won't say you're making the

85
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:52,100
connection,
but somehow a connection gets made.

86
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,420
And that's called an insight.
You're going to have profound insights.

87
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,950
I mean sciences,
you know,

88
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,410
sort of storied,
you know,

89
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:03,890
wonderful stories of Eureka moments,
insight where,

90
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,460
and it's usually not by driving,
thinking and banging your head against

91
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:09,950
the world's way.
And you thought as much as you've gone

92
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,790
as far as thought can take you,
and then you rest in awareness.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,780
Maybe sometimes it's in sleep or you
wake up out of asleep and then no.
