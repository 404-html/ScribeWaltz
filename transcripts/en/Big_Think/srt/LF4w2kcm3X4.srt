1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,860
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,180
yeah,
it's definitely a growing trend.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,260
Um,
there's always been a connection between

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,060
philosophy and science.
In fact,

5
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,040
in the beginning there was no
distinction,

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,190
so aristotle was a philosopher.
He was also a biologist.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,000
He was also an economist,
um,

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,030
and in a way he was a physicist,
so yeah,

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,210
but it is coming closer together again.
And I think the reason for this is that,

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,920
um,
you know,

11
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:41,540
scientists are studying things of great
interest to philosophers like,

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,090
uh,
the scientific study of free will that

13
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:47,720
really got going.
I'm not until the 19 eighties when these

14
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:50,210
Liberte experiments that I talked about
started up,

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,360
um,
there's been a lot of good social

16
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:56,780
psychological work on things like
weakness of will and self deception for

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,250
well more than decades.
Um,

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,450
and I've been interested in that stuff
since I was young.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,180
Um,
it is growing I think.

20
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,010
Yeah,
because there's more scientific done a

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
work done now on these philosophical
topics.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,170
Um.
Oh,

23
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,960
I don't know what else it might be that
people are thinking.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,810
Well,
traditional philosophical methodologies

25
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,080
have been around for a long time and
they've gotten us to a certain place and

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,580
that's good,
but we can get even further faster by

27
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,980
bringing more on board,
you know,

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,030
scientific results.
Um,

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,141
and,
uh,

30
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,780
I actually do a lot of work with
scientists.

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,970
In fact,
I think I can mention this now.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,380
I'm,
I'm about to receive a four point

33
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:44,381
$8,000,000 grant to start a freewill
project at Florida State University

34
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,510
where I am.
And,

35
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:50,750
uh,
the granting agency is the John

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,680
Templeton Foundation.
Now,

37
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:56,360
most of the money will go out in grants
to scientists and others who make

38
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:01,361
proposals on free will a two point 8
million that's going to go out to the

39
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:06,080
science of freewill.
And what I'd like to see happen is that

40
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:10,310
we have teams of neuroscientists,
social psychologists and philosophers

41
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,020
working together,
uh,

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,320
to design a freewill studies and then,
you know,

43
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:18,320
write up the papers,
analyze the results and so on.

44
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,440
Um,
so for me this is a really exciting

45
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,340
time,
uh,

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,460
at the intersection of science and
philosophy and,

47
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,840
uh,
this thing called experimental

48
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:30,470
philosophy,
which didn't really exist until 10 years

49
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:34,640
ago has really taken off.
I was up here in New York City last

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,540
Monday,
um,

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,970
to be in a session on experimental
philosophy.

52
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,730
There was a big audience,
a lot of excitement.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,790
Uh,
so in 10 years it's gone from nothing to

54
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,110
something pretty exciting.
