1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,170
There were several steps along the way.
I went to college at overland and Ohio

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,200
and after that I went to Boston and then
after a couple of years there I went to

3
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:24,201
Grad School in Arizona in Tucson at the
University of Arizona and I stayed there

4
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,821
seven years and I met a woman who is
entering the Grad program just as I was

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,850
leaving and she was from Pakistan,
her name's asthma.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,843
Awesome.
Han.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,420
And we ended up getting married and then
after staying another year in Arizona,

8
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:51,810
after her graduation was she,
we were both eager to go somewhere and

9
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,600
try something different.
Um,

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,650
she had just come into the country to go
to university and then Grad school,

11
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,360
so she wasn't,
you know,

12
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,130
it wasn't an immigration thing or
something.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,090
So we looked around,
we applied for jobs overseas.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,530
We ended up going to Morocco for three
years as English teachers.

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,400
And uh,
that was,

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,370
that was interesting.

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,803
Well,

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
my world view of the states has been
slowly changing over time,

19
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,620
but yes,
there is nothing like leaving the

20
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:34,290
country to help you look back and see
the country more clearly.

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,210
And there's nothing like living with
people who are quite skeptical about the

22
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:43,470
intentions of your country to make you
think about that.

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,080
Um,
however,

24
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,680
I have to say that I'm just on a
personal level both in Morocco and then

25
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,690
in then people are incredibly friendly
and hospitable and interested and kind

26
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,850
of this idea that they're all just
raving lunatics a like you see on the

27
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:06,690
cover of Newsweek
is simply not true.

28
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:10,530
It's a lie is a lie designed to make you
stay home.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,580
And so yes,
many people have very strong opinions

30
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,320
about Israel,
Palestine.

31
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:21,321
They think that Israel gets billions of
dollars per year,

32
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,850
which it does,
and the Palestinians get nothing and the

33
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,750
it money is being used for repression
and so forth.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,080
That's a legitimate political opinion to
have.

35
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,900
Does this mean that they walk up to me
and beat me up on the street?

36
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,950
No,
it does not.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,770
And that I wish that,
um,

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,170
perception could change.
