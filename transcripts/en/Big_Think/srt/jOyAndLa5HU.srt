1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
My book,
the psychopath and site is a memoir and

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:09,231
it's a mix of a personal story and what
the science is that it's the psychiatry

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:13,410
and the genetics and the neuroscience
behind what the subject is,

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,800
which is psychopathy,
but it's really a story about somebody

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,780
me who had 60 finds out.
He's not really who he thought he was

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:26,580
all along in his whole life and not
until I had,

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,090
just by serendipity,
by chance started to run across

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,760
biological evidence first from pet
scans,

9
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:35,830
positron emission tomography scans,
uh,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,170
that I was involved with a acted as a
control in one study in Alzheimer's

11
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,330
disease and,
uh,

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,550
and also had my genetics done.
So it was just as a control and compared

13
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:51,420
to people with Alzheimer's.
And so it was through that about,

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,320
oh,
seven,

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,050
six,
seven years ago that I found out

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,710
something very strange and in,
in this something strange,

17
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,030
both in terms of my brain pattern.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,030
And then genetics happened to run.
It intersected with another study.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,190
I had been doing a minor study on
looking at pet scans and Mris.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,410
Another kind of brain scan and SPEC
scans of,

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,230
of killers,
really bad murderers and these are

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,220
particularly bad on brays and some
serial killers,

23
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,830
et cetera.
And I had looked at these bananas to

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,650
analyze them over the years from the
early 19 nineties onward and in,

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,370
in about the same time,
2005 when I was doing my own scans for

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,280
the South San Study.
I had got a whole group of these killers

27
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,420
and a psychopath and looked at a pattern
I sent my God,

28
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:41,790
there's a pattern in the brain for these
guys.

29
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,200
And so I started to talk about it,
give talks and uh,

30
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,820
you know,
at academic institutions and psychiatry

31
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,110
departments,
law schools,

32
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:53,490
etc. Just to kind of vet the idea.
But at the same time I got this pile of

33
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:54,510
scans back,
uh,

34
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,060
that included my own and these other
controls.

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,660
And I was looking through.
I got to the last scan of that study at

36
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,170
the alzheimer's and I,
I looked at it and I asked my

37
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,641
technician,
I said,

38
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,520
you've got to check the machines because
this is obviously one of the killers.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,980
So one of the murders,
it looked like a really,

40
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:15,480
like a severe case of brain activity
lost in a psychopath.

41
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,080
And so when I ultimately they said,
no,

42
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,660
this is part of,
it's in this control group.

43
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,730
And I had to tear back the,
uh,

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,040
the name on it because I always do
anything blind,

45
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,400
but this was like something's really
wrong and it turned out to be my name.

46
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,811
So it was like,
you know,

47
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,330
gandalf shows up at the door and you're
it.

48
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,690
And so that started this whole
traJectory.

49
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,510
Now,
at first I didn't think I laughed at it

50
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,920
and,
and I just didn't care.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,180
We were so busy working on the genetics
of alzheimer's and also schizophrenia

52
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,790
and I had just started an adult stem
cell company.

53
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,470
And so,
so busy with stuff.

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,940
I kind of let it go for a couple of
years,

55
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,210
really a year and a half.
But then the genetics came back and I

56
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:58,680
had all the genetic illegals,
the forms of the genes that are

57
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:02,560
associated with the high aggression and
violence,

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,650
psychopathy and a low kind of empathy,
interpersonal,

59
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,760
emotional empathy and low anxiety.
and in it,

60
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,750
when I got that back,
I started to take a little bit of an but

61
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:19,480
it's still didn't care about it and it
wasn't until I ended up giving a talk,

62
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:23,140
I was asked to give a talk with the ex
prime minister of oslow and bipolar

63
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,530
disorder.
And so I went to oslo to give a puBlic

64
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,850
talk with him than a clinician on
bipolar,

65
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,080
you know,
what's the brain patterns?

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,750
And I had to use my own example of how
we,

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,740
you do imaging genetics,
we take imaging of the brain genetics,

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,160
put it together in a mathematIcal model
and how we figure it out so it can be

69
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:46,930
used for all sorts of psychiatry and
medicine and in the audience or the

70
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,860
psychiatrist there.
And I went through my own pathologies,

71
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:53,560
if you will,
or near clinical syndromes and my

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,710
netflix and my brain scan.
And at the end the head of the

73
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,720
department there said,
you don't even know this.

74
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,281
I bet,
but you,

75
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,250
you're bipolar first of all because you
don't have the kind of bipolar in the

76
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,930
United States that,
that they use.

77
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,940
What are the kinds.
So that's interesting.

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,560
And he said,
I want to talk to you afterwards.

79
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,360
So I met with the psychiatrist
afterwards and they said,

80
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,500
you're probably borderline psychopath to
looking at all this.

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,640
So.
Well,

82
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,950
this was kind of a real surprise.
It's a first time I took it seriously

83
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,710
because I had not only the biological
evidence,

84
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,770
but these people didn't even know me.
They were just looking at the data,

85
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,080
you know,
and they could see my behaviors.

86
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
And in talking to me for a couple hours
after that talk at somebody's house,

87
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,450
they said,
you probably do.

88
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,240
So when I flew back to the United
States,

89
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,310
uh,
what I did is I started,

90
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,850
I said,
I started asking the psychiatrist and

91
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:43,540
neurologist that I knew really well for
many years and who know my behaviors,

92
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,510
including my not so nice behaviors.
And I said,

93
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,190
you gotta tell me what you really think
of me.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,890
And each one of them had said,
well,

95
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,440
you know,
we told you for many years,

96
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:53,790
you,
you're,

97
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,511
you're,
you know,

98
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:57,220
you do psychopathic things.
You're probably a borderline psychopath.

99
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,180
I said,
I said,

100
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,431
no,
no,

101
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:58,540
no.

102
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,210
You said I was crazy.
That's what we never said and be crazy

103
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,180
and act crazy,
but you're like a borderline psychopath.

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,940
Then I asked all my close friends,
my wife,

105
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,210
people in my family,
and they all had the same thing to say.

106
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
And at that point
it was really kind of hit me.

107
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,171
I was like,
well,

108
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,380
this is maybe true.
And I started to take the test for

109
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:24,460
psychopathy and it came up borderline
borderline psychopath that is a very

110
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,530
high score,
but without being at what's called the

111
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:31,531
categorical full blown a psychopath,
which contains these anti,

112
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,850
a lot of antisocial and criminal parts
of it.

113
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,690
And since I'm not a criminal,
I've had conversations with the police

114
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,670
many times,
but I am always able to kind of talk my

115
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,200
way out of it and get them to lAugh,
you know.

116
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,430
And so,
uh,

117
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,560
but I have no record or anything,
but you know,

118
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,140
I've done some fun things now.

119
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,880
And so at that point,
and I was just sitting with these two

120
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:55,150
psychiatrists and they said,
you got all this evidence in front of

121
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:55,880
you do.
I mean,

122
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,980
you see what's going at.
And I'll tell you,

123
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,860
I didn't care,
I really didn't care at all.

124
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,830
And they said that's the point,
you don't care.

125
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,600
And so,
uh,

126
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,710
so that at that point,
uh,

127
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,481
you know,
I,

128
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:12,380
I had started to beg,
gave a ted talk and then a moth talk

129
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,180
world science festival and then I got
contacted by some people,

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,690
a different prime shows.
It wouldn't be on criminal minds and

131
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,560
things like that.
But after that I got contacted by the

132
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,540
same day by three literary agents in New
York and they said,

133
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,510
you've got to read a book on this.
But people really interested in this.

134
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,540
And it was personal too.
When I wrote the book,

135
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,790
I really met and had a heart to heart
talk with my old family.

136
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,070
I said,
because this is going to be,

137
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,110
it could be embarrassing,
you know,

138
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,080
for all of us.
There could be some exposure and risk,

139
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:47,081
but they were sort of a heroic about it.
I just had to count on my own narcissism

140
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,010
to drive it.
You're like,

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,851
I can do this,
you know,

142
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:50,940
I can beat this,
I can write this.

143
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:54,110
I am tough.
And so I kind of use some of the traits

144
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,540
to drive it forward.
So,

145
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,200
uh,
so actually coming out like this,

146
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,500
uh,
it also assured that I couldn't get away

147
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,880
with things anymore,
you know,

148
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,320
and when you tell people what you're
doing,

149
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:09,380
like I do in the book,
many of the things they're looking for

150
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:09,720
it.
And,

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,030
and,
and it's so it's like,

152
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,860
you know,
my game is up in,

153
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,350
in a sense,
but I'm also 66.

154
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,450
I'm mean,
how do I really want to be that way

155
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:17,960
anymore?

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,793
I,
you know,

157
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,450
uh,
I still have fun with it,

158
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,370
but it's,
it's just the challenge,

159
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:22,970
right?
It's,

160
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,620
it's a challenge and I think I can
overcome it.

161
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:29,621
So I have to use my ego and my sense of
narcissism to manipulate myself to

162
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,080
handled,
you know.

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
And um,
and,

164
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,240
but it was really my family that said,
go for it.

165
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,610
My mother is still alive.
And she'll say,

166
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm,
you're saying too much.

167
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,830
You'd saying way too much.
And of course I said my,

168
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,240
you don't know what the half of it,
you know,

169
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:47,390
of course I said,
as long as you're alive and my family's

170
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,224
alive,
my kids,

171
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,210
you know,
I'm telling you know,

172
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,050
a piece of the story,
but I give a fair amount in the book

173
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,140
more than in my talks.
But I asked the psychiatrist who'd known

174
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:04,100
me as nomi for many years,
what behaviors that are not so obvious

175
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,100
that I do talk to people that would be
psychopathic.

176
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,150
And they asked me about revenge.
Am I getting even that?

177
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,270
Everybody gets mad,
right?

178
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,620
Somebody ticks you off.
You get mad.

179
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,020
He could make five seconds,
30 seconds,

180
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,400
a minute up to an rp,
everybody,

181
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,970
it's a normal thing.
And your serotonin kicks in after about

182
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,730
five minutes at a cools you down.
And psychopaths,

183
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,410
it doesn't happen.
It stays on.

184
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,910
It stays on a hard boil a.
But even though he could control it,

185
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,120
you're still angry.
You can stay angry for extremely long

186
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,470
periods of time.
And um,

187
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,960
and that is sort of set up in utero
because those areas of the brain that

188
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:45,950
respond to serotonin are altered by
these so called warrior gene,

189
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,720
so they don't respond when you get
older,

190
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,030
when the serotonin would have made you
calm.

191
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,690
And so psychopath will get very angry,
but they'll stay angry.

192
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,170
And in the case of,
of mine,

193
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,990
I what I,
what I told them,

194
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,940
the two of the psychiatrists were very
close to me.

195
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,961
I said,
well,

196
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,700
when I get mad,
I don't show it to anybody.

197
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,460
I said,
I could be furious at you.

198
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,280
You would never know it.
I show no anger whatsoever at don't show

199
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,050
anxious anxiety to them.
I said,

200
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,100
first of all,
you'll never know.

201
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,880
And I said,
I could sit on it for a year or two or

202
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,710
three or five,
but I'll get you.

203
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,190
And I always do.
And they don't know where it's coming

204
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,840
from.
They can't tie it to the event.

205
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,530
And that comes out of nowhere and
something dramatic happens in their

206
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,600
life.
But I'm very careful,

207
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,600
uh,
almost pristine about it.

208
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,360
That's a fair response.
It's a proportional response.

209
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,440
So if somebody does something,
you can do a lot,

210
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,313
you know,
I could,

211
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,390
you could say anything to me and I won't
get mad.

212
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:41,100
Really.
I'm not at those things.

213
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,960
Don't get me mad.
Someone's trying to get me.

214
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,880
It's like another cycle path or another,
you know,

215
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,580
somebodies trying to mess with me.
Uh,

216
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,560
I,
I have a high threshold.

217
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,150
So many things really.
Don't get me mad.

218
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,580
You could just about,
do anything.

219
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm pretty cool that way,
but you've really do.

220
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:59,820
Then I always get even and it in it and
I'll make sure it's the same sort of

221
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,600
intensity that they,
their,

222
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,260
their initial damage and I said I can
stay cool and it'll happen in these.

223
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,550
Still look around.
They don't what happened with their job,

224
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:09,960
what happened with their family,
what happened?

225
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,650
They'll they won't know.
And they both said that psychopath.

226
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
That's exactly it.
And so some of the,

227
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,600
you know,
people at the bbc and in Australia who I

228
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,240
had talked to some science writers this.
So that's what dexter is.

229
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,021
So,
and I really,

230
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:28,470
when I saw dexter,
I absolutely understood it because he

231
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,830
was being fair,
being fair to the universe and the world

232
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,610
of ethics of the universe.

233
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,420
He was absolutely fair.
A morality wise,

234
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,020
not so much,
but I,

235
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,660
I could really understand that behavior.
One of the surprises for me,

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,200
uh,
about starting about six years ago and

237
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,800
for the few years until now when I said,
you know,

238
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,980
there's something is really wrong that I
was not cognizant of.

239
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,390
I didn't know I had this.
And,

240
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,740
and,
uh,

241
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,300
even though other people did,
they didn't,

242
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,190
they won't tell you,
you know,

243
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,570
once I asked,
they said,

244
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:04,890
of course you're that.
But so people protect people close to

245
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:06,700
them.
They protect our tormentors.

246
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,070
It's kind of a,
a family,

247
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:11,310
stockholm effect.
And I've interviewed some really

248
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,260
dangerous bad guys in prison and who,
they'll protect theIr tormentors.

249
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,820
And so the left hands,
you,

250
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,370
you won't find this out,
but you have to ask and you have to say,

251
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,610
I'm not going to get even with you,
just telling me the truth and you say it

252
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,320
to enough people that they know you're
doing it.

253
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,600
Then you'll,
you'll find that out.

254
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,330
So when that happened,
and I started to think,

255
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,441
I said,
well,

256
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,840
how can I change this without anybody
knowing?

257
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,420
So I just started with my wife a couple
of years ago.

258
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,620
I started and I,
every time I was about to do something

259
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:41,790
with her,
you know,

260
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,380
we're pouring a glass of wine or eating
or going to a show,

261
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,660
anything I would stop for one moment
and,

262
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,280
and I would say,
what are you doing?

263
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,890
And I noticed that every time I was
about to do something with her,

264
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,050
it was the absolutely the most selfish
thing.

265
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,380
And for regular behavior it's like you
pour yourself the wine first,

266
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:03,010
you serve yourself first,
you try to get out of some duties even

267
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,870
though you'd make it look like you're,
you know,

268
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,290
you're cleaning up.
But also it gets worse than that.

269
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,720
So you know,
for bIrthdays or you know,

270
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,040
if there was a big party going on and
there was a death in the family,

271
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,010
an uncle or an aunt,
and I thought there's another party,

272
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:19,600
I would make up an excuse to go to the
party.

273
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,500
I would just blow off those things and,
but it would extend it to everything I

274
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:24,580
was doing,
you know,

275
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,450
and even to the people who were close to
me to not only family,

276
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,000
uh,
and,

277
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,170
and I noticed that and I said,
geez,

278
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,600
I said everything I'm doing is maximally
like selfish,

279
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,310
so I have to slow myself down now and
try to just do the correct thing.

280
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,280
They're very small.
You have to start small because that's

281
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,810
where you have to start because the
other stuff is true.

282
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,550
Traumatic.
They really try to change yourself.

283
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,970
But I've tried doing this and I noticed
that and I didn't tell her I was doing

284
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:53,190
this and other people and they said,
I like your behavior and it's,

285
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,020
you're,
you're different.

286
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,853
Why?
What happened?

287
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,830
And I told them and I said,
I said,

288
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:57,970
you know,
I don't really mean it.

289
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,160
And they said,
my wife,

290
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,210
she goes,
I don't care.

291
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,000
You just treating me better.
And I went,

292
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,850
I couldn't believe it.
I thought,

293
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,540
see,
I had taken that whole thing of empathy,

294
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,570
meaning beyond what people behaviorally
are asking for and everybody in my life,

295
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,940
they said,
who knows what people's motivations are?

296
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,250
If you're treating me well,
it means you're trying and that's all

297
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,770
that matters.
This blew me away and I just,

298
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,620
I really still don't understand it,
but I keep trying to do that.

299
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,760
Right?
And so I.

300
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,700
But I have to stop myself and in each
one of these,

301
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,910
anytime I do something,
so what's the right thing to do?

302
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,980
And when you do that,
you're somebody like me.

303
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,130
You realize your whole day is spent
thousands of times during the most

304
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:39,730
selfish thing.
