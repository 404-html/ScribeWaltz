1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,890
The Internet of things is an idea that's
been around for uh,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,310
I dunno,
maybe 10,

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:09,600
15 years or so.
And I think the first time I heard about

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:10,830
it,
um,

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,010
there was some discussion of a European,
uh,

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:19,011
appliance manufacturer who had a
refrigerator that was connected to the

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,110
network,
the,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,210
the Internet.
And,

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,780
uh,
I think the,

10
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,980
the scenarios that were playing out
there,

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,550
we're okay.
What if the refrigerator was smart and

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,840
knew that the new enough to adjust
temperatures,

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,700
maybe it new enough to send a request or
a message to the manufacturer saying,

14
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,740
Hey,
the compressor's going bad.

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,310
Um,
that was Kinda the first time I had

16
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:48,720
heard about this idea of connecting a
product to the network,

17
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,540
a product that wasn't a traditional
computer.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,590
It wasn't something that we thought was
supposed to be connected to the network

19
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,750
are interconnected.
And that started to open up,

20
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,400
um,
a lot of people's eyes,

21
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,900
I think to this idea.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,580
Um,
it may not have been the first

23
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:06,090
theoretical time that it was discussed,
but it was the first time that I think

24
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,900
popular media and culture started
talking about this idea.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
But for whatever reason that connected
refrigerator really didn't take off the

26
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,310
idea,
really didn't kind of explode,

27
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,050
I think.
Then we started hearing about the

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,840
connected washing machine and the same
kind of context.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,260
And I think that that idea of the
Internet of things then started to

30
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,870
refine a bit.
And we heard about machine to machine

31
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:35,310
communication,
the idea that instead of human to

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,130
machine,
so sort of a through a screen or through

33
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,340
a web page or through our mobile phones
or whatever,

34
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,400
that machines would talk to one another.
And uh,

35
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:46,850
so the idea of a,
a,

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,860
a stock quote generating a message that
would be sent to another machine that

37
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,310
might think about,
okay,

38
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,690
now I made need to make a trade.

39
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,690
So the automated trading world or a
weather forecast that's reported online

40
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,610
triggering a message,
uh,

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,010
to another system that's going to adjust
stock levels.

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,390
So this idea that machines might talk to
one another without a human in between

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,480
was sort of a refinement.
I think of the Internet of things idea.

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,790
And now,
uh,

45
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,730
over the last handful of years we're
seeing more consumer facing,

46
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,650
um,
ideas and concepts.

47
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:23,520
And products coming out that I think of
has regenerated interest in this,

48
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,860
in this machine to machine
communication.

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
So now we're hearing things about the
connected car and the connected

50
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:36,040
thermostat and the smart home.
And so now that the,

51
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,020
the consumer side of things is,
is heating up,

52
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,290
we're also asking ourselves from a
business perspective,

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,400
what is the Internet of things for a
business maybe where you don't have a

54
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,590
consumer product or a,
a thing,

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,920
a widget that you sell,
maybe you're a services company or bank.

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,620
What does the Internet of things mean
for a business like that,

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,860
particularly a services company.
And so for,

58
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,870
for companies that aren't as a consumer
facing or product oriented,

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,501
I think,
you know,

60
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,630
there,
there's more opportunity but more,

61
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,240
um,
sort of clouds around what that,

62
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,040
what the Internet of things means for
business.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,210
And I think that anything that we,
uh,

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,510
that we think about that we estimate
that we,

65
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,420
uh,
operate in the places we work in,

66
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,580
people we work with.
Um,

67
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,230
we think about the effectiveness of
those things,

68
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,020
the effectiveness of our workplace,
the effectiveness of a warehouse,

69
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:36,310
the effectiveness of routes that a truck
takes or that a forklift makes.

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,280
Um,
and we make guesses about the right ways

71
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,850
to,
to design a workspace or design a

72
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,520
logistics path,
design and warehouse.

73
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,150
And the question is,
can we use the idea of sensors to

74
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,340
collect data about things that we were
just guessing about?

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,500
Before that we were estimating that we
were,

76
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,530
that we were sort of like using our gut
to,

77
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,900
to design.
Can we collect real data about

78
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,901
performance of people and places and
processes that can give us more insight

79
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:13,270
into optimizing and evolving our designs
for the way our business works.

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,670
And that's what I call the Internet of
business things.

81
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,690
It's not the consumer facing stuff,
it's the business stuff.

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,940
Most of the data we think about,
uh,

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,811
from a,
uh,

84
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,350
an enterprise perspective is,
is sort of modular.

85
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,940
It's transactional.
It's,

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,240
it's a a call center call or it's a web
transaction or it's a sale or it's a a

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
quote.
Um,

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,710
or it's a piece of data about a product.
Um,

89
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,230
but the Internet of things we'll be
creating streams of data.

90
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,360
So one of the analogies is,
is how social media create streams of

91
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,070
data.
So we've got tweets and we've got,

92
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,590
uh,
flows on our,

93
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,110
uh,
on our wall and such that are more

94
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,580
streams of information.

95
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,110
And so think about a,
a sensor that might be on a,

96
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,080
on a door and a warehouse.
Every time the door opens,

97
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,870
the sensor records a,
a door opening,

98
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,160
a time of day,
day of week.

99
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,470
Um,
maybe it creates some other ambient

100
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,530
information,
like it records the temperature in the,

101
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,310
in the facility or it records how long
the door was open or whatever.

102
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,580
So these are little bits of data that
are happening every time the door is

103
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,450
open and that door might be open a lot
of times during an hour or a,

104
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,930
or a day or a week or a month.
But it's creating these streams of data

105
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,900
and it's,
it's not like that one piece of data

106
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:32,410
might be that interesting,
but it's the trends and the patterns and

107
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,800
things that we're looking for in the
data that may be what we're looking for.

108
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,420
So I want to know,
you know,

109
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,030
how often is that room used,
uh,

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,920
during the morning,
the afternoon,

111
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,810
certain days of the week,
weeks of the month,

112
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,351
that,
you know,

113
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,340
months of the year to help me be more
efficient about the way I staff people

114
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,970
in that office or,
uh,

115
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,090
the,
the temperature or the cooling or the

116
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,370
electricity that I feed to that part of
my,

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,540
uh,
of my facility.

118
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,080
So that data that's created,
these streams of data are,

119
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,830
are sets of data that I may not already
have a,

120
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,980
uh,
a technology platform to process.

121
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,870
I don't know how to process streams.
Maybe.

122
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,450
So now I have to think about a new
architecture,

123
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,630
a new way to process a stream of data,
not just a stream,

124
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,720
but you know,
maybe I have a hundred facilities that I

125
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,840
have the sensors in and they're creating
these streams of data.

126
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,930
So now I've got a a new challenge around
data.

127
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,180
One of the challenges starts to feed and
link into the big data topic.

128
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
So as I'm collecting the,
these individual sensor data points over

129
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,810
hundreds or thousands or tens of
thousands of sensors every minute or

130
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,150
every second,
I've now got these,

131
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,130
these,
these parallel streams of data I have to

132
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,910
process.
And so it's unclear exactly how much

133
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,830
data I would want to keep for how long.
But it's certainly a new kind of data

134
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:56,270
architecture and for some companies will
be a big data problem because there's

135
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,700
going to be a lot of this data for large
companies,

136
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,360
for a lot of sensors and a lot of
facilities or a lot of products that

137
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:05,390
they want to track or whatever it is
that they want to get more insight into

138
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:10,391
by putting tags or sensors on them.
So to me this is one of the sort of

139
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:17,111
subset subdomains of big data around
sensor data streams of data that we're

140
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:20,330
going to have to think about new
architectures and new designs for a new

141
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,520
technologies,
for capturing them,

142
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,170
storing them,
processing them,

143
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,820
aggregating them,
analyzing them.

144
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,680
And so on.
So I think it's going to be a real

145
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:32,681
interesting evolution to see how the big
data technologies and and technologies

146
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,880
in general are,
are emerging to deal with streams of,

147
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:38,690
of sensor data.
