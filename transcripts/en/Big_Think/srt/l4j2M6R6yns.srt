1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,680
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,430
they certainly voted cover,
they exist since 2000 years and they

3
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,970
have a very strong message,
uh,

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,550
but
they don't deserve to recover soon

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,750
unless they really accept the guilt that
some individuals loaded on themselves

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,620
and the institution has to learn that
perhaps the conditions under which

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,720
priests work are conducive to certain
misbehavior.

8
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,490
So maybe the conditions will have to be
changed.

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,970
This has been the case,
a indeed so close reformation by Martin

10
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,340
Luther and others at that time.
The Catholic Church was it in a much

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,430
worse state of affairs,
much with much more guilt in that sense.

12
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:14,710
Then today,
and it has a kind of led to a

13
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:16,850
purification.
Uh,

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,950
the challenge from the reformation from
the reformation has led the Catholics to

15
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,820
learn,
but from luther and others.

16
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,540
So now they are almost
undistinguishable.
