1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,220
Oh,
I'm art.

2
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:11,280
Learn a loud.
I'm a seismologist at the Lamont Doherty

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,050
Earth Observatory of Columbia
University.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,450
Uh,
I'm also associate director for the

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,540
division of Seismology Geology and
tectonic physics.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,210
Oh,
seismology is a study of earthquakes and

7
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:26,310
the earth.
Uh,

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,920
there are two parts of seismology want
us to actually look in detail at the

9
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:34,160
earthquakes themselves.
And the other is to use the earthquakes

10
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,730
as a sort of light source for
photographing or imaging the earth

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,650
imaging.
The earth is something that we sometimes

12
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:44,000
call it structural seismology but very
much like a cat scan you might get an a

13
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,360
medical office.
We use the waves generated by

14
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:51,110
earthquakes to aluminate this internal
structure of the earth.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,750
Uh,
one of the great mysteries of the planet

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,020
is what is your Earth made out of?
How does that stuff move?

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,060
And seismology is really a remote
sensing tool for us to try to understand

18
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:02,894
that.

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,860
Well,
one of,

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,300
one of the wonderful things that has
happened in the earth sciences over the

21
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,690
last 40 years is what we call the theory
of plate tectonics.

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,170
And Plate tectonics really is a very
descriptive working hypothesis that

23
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,260
allows us to take diverse sets of
observations and put them together and

24
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,740
see if we can understand how the,
how the planet as a whole works.

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,350
Uh,
but plate tectonics really is just a,

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,640
a kinematic theory.
What that means is that it really only

27
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,240
describes the motions of the plates,
how fast they move,

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,240
uh,
what their boundaries look like and so

29
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,400
on.
Um,

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,920
but we really don't know how they move
or what forces them to move.

31
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,160
And to do that,
we really have to penetrate into the

32
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,750
interior of the earth.
Now,

33
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,050
in many ways,
the earth is like a big bubbling pot of

34
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,780
fix soup,
non geologic time.

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,450
The earth is really a fluid.
Of course on human time.

36
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,260
It's a rock.
You hit a rock with a hammer and my

37
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,100
crumble and break a,
but on geologic time,

38
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,970
the earth really behaves like a big
melted plastic ball.

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,980
And,
uh,

40
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,680
it's the movement of that molten
material,

41
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,150
uh,
that plastic,

42
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,240
that warm plastic material that really
drives the plates,

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,530
but we can't observe it directly.
And so we use earthquakes and,

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,380
and uh,
what we call structural seismology,

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,610
uh,
to image it.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,400
Um,
if you were taking a,

47
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,710
or if you were interested in the
workings of the human body,

48
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,710
uh,
what you would do would be to take a cat

49
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:36,360
scans or three dimensional images from
time to time to time to get sort of a,

50
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,940
a movie of how the body works.
Well,

51
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,710
that's exactly what we're doing with the
seismology.

52
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,360
We take cat scans,
time,

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,223
time,
time,

54
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,310
and it gives us some indication of,
of what's going on.

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,690
Uh,
of course,

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,930
uh,
we can't do our experiments in geologic

57
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,700
time.
It would just take too long.

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,770
So we use proxies to get,
let us attain kind of a movie.

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,510
Uh,
it's something that we sometimes call

60
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,740
four d seismology.

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,370
Well,
a 40 seismology really means that we're

62
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,440
looking at the earth in three
dimensions,

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,270
uh,
uh,

64
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,680
up down north,
south,

65
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,514
east,
west,

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,210
the three physical dimensions of our
real world and sort of getting a time

67
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,630
history.
Geologic time occurs over millions of

68
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,320
years.
So he,

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,780
uh,
you know,

70
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,170
the lifetime of a single scientist,
he can observe that.

71
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,160
But over the years,
we've developed proxies to replace that.

72
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,760
And we can use seismology,
we can use petrology,

73
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,680
the study of rocks.
Uh,

74
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,860
we can look at the ages of rocks and
various ways we can even use

75
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,260
paleontology,
the study of fossils to get some

76
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,440
indication of what the history of the
earth looks like.

77
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,510
Um,
but the,

78
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,230
the,
you know,

79
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,430
the real,
uh,

80
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,440
incredible thing that has happened is
that the three dimensional aspect of

81
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,000
that problem,
uh,

82
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,450
has really just exploded in the last
decade or so.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,210
Um,
you know,

84
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,280
seismic instrumentation used to be pen
and paper,

85
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,130
uh,
used to have these rotating drums with a

86
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,460
pen that would wiggle every time and
earthquake waves passed for example.

87
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,160
Uh,
but right now we of course would record

88
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,440
that digital and that's like the move
from analog tape to,

89
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,400
to cds or dvds.
Um,

90
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,600
so that's one,
one element.

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,450
But the other is that,
uh,

92
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,070
you know,
we used to have to wait for an

93
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,060
earthquake and we didn't have very many
instruments in the ground,

94
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:31,480
just a couple of hundred a,
but now we can put thousands of

95
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,080
instruments into the ground.
And so we get a much finer picture,

96
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,710
much more highly resolved picture like
as if you,

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,720
we had been shooting through cheesecloth
or a gauze or vaseline or something like

98
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,220
that.
We,

99
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,550
we,
we've never been able to really see the

100
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,160
earth and all its clarity and now we
can,

101
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,710
um,
we're part of a project called Earth

102
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,970
scope,
for example,

103
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:54,880
which is like a giant high resolution
telescope,

104
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,720
not pointed to the universe,
but pointed down into the earth.

105
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,900
Uh,
we know less about the earth really than

106
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,550
we know about the universe at this
point.

107
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,710
Uh,
but this telescope is just giving us

108
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:08,260
fantastic images.
We're starting off with the North

109
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,920
American continent and our hope is that
over the next decades will be doing that

110
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,060
around the earth as well.

111
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,560
Bell earthquakes are a weird kind of
phenomenon in the following sense.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,810
Um,
when we talk about the theory of plate

113
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,010
tectonics,
the,

114
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,360
the working hypothesis is that it's a
smooth motion of the plates,

115
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,600
uh,
that the plates move over geologic time

116
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,420
with predictable rates.
Uh,

117
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,950
it's as if they're,
uh,

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,080
kind of a slow movement of traffic,
if you will.

119
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,030
Everybody sort of moving at a rate that
stays constant in time.

120
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,770
But obviously earthquakes happen.
Earthquakes predominantly occur where

121
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:51,130
the plates interact with one another
along what we call plate boundaries.

122
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,230
Obviously,
uh,

123
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,020
sometimes those plate boundaries or
sideways like we have in the San Andreas

124
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,670
fault or the earthquake that happened in
Haiti.

125
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,430
Uh,
sometimes those boundaries are

126
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:06,200
compressional like what happened in
Chile or what might happen off the coast

127
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,940
of Seattle.
And,

128
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,070
uh,
sometimes those boundaries are what we

129
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,870
call extensional.
Uh,

130
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,980
best example of this would be the basin
and range and the western United States,

131
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,040
uh,
around the longitude of Salt Lake City

132
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,720
going all the way west to the Sierra.

133
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,000
Uh,
so those three types of boundaries sort

134
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,630
of describe what,
how the plates inter interact,

135
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,010
but earthquakes,
of course,

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,480
anodic continuous process by any means
there really what we call a stick slip

137
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:36,560
process.
So while the hypothesis of plate

138
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,470
tectonics or the working model is that
the plates move,

139
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,100
uh,
at a relatively constant rate at the

140
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,940
boundaries,
they stick and they slip a,

141
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,860
the boundaries don't move at a
relatively constant rate.

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,880
Instead the boundaries stick and when
they stick,

143
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,740
the movement of the plates stresses that
boundary and eventually that stress

144
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,100
overcomes the strength of that boundary
and it breaks.

145
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,620
And that breakage is an earthquake as
sort of our,

146
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,430
what we call the stick slip model or a,
we have other names for it.

147
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,630
But that's basically what happens.
Um,

148
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,450
the problem that we face as earthquake
seismologist is that sticking and

149
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,930
slipping is almost a chaotic process,
not quite,

150
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:18,530
but almost.

151
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,510
And so it's very difficult to predict on
a day to day basis over geologic time.

152
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,920
Of course,
it's very predictable.

153
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,200
We can get an idea of where the active
plate boundaries are a those plate

154
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,760
boundaries,
of course our major faults in the earth.

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,080
And,
uh,

156
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,850
we know where the earthquakes will
occur,

157
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:42,851
but because we can't predict the stick
and slips cycle very well of certainly

158
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,070
over human timescales,
uh,

159
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,060
we can't really get what we call a
prediction.

160
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,030
Uh,
but there's a deeper understanding of it

161
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,240
that that allows us to forecast instead
of predict.

162
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,160
And by forecast,
I mean,

163
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,990
well first of all,
we know where they occur because we know

164
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,200
where the plate boundaries are.
Um,

165
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,980
but we can get a sense of what the
probability of an earthquake might be in

166
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:05,090
two ways.
One,

167
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,960
by looking at the past history and if we
have enough earthquakes,

168
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,970
we can sort of get a statistical model
of,

169
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,590
of wind and earthquakes might occur and
that gives us some probability.

170
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,660
And the other is to actually do a bit of
forward modeling and actually take the

171
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:23,240
plate motions,
take a model of,

172
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,370
of the friction along the plate
boundary.

173
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,100
Uh,
take a model of how the stress builds up

174
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,870
and sort of predict when and where or I
should say forecast when the next

175
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,510
earthquake might occur.
And it's gotten to the point where we

176
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,780
can probably do that over the span of a
decade or two,

177
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:40,640
perhaps 30 years.
Uh,

178
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,550
to the extent that we can,
uh,

179
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,190
sort of provide an actuarial table,
uh,

180
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,560
if you want to go out and buy insurance
in California.

181
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,580
As a matter of fact,
there is such an actuarial table to help

182
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,740
you determine what your rates are or I
should say a healthy insurance companies

183
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,570
determine what they're going to charge
you.

184
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,670
And of course we didn't have that for
Haiti.

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,590
Uh,
we had barely had that for Chile.

186
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,960
Uh,
but the point is we're getting better at

187
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:04,920
it.
So,

188
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,140
you know,
one of the exciting parts of earthquake

189
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:11,820
seismology is that the better we get at
forecasting earthquakes,

190
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,800
the closer we might actually come to a
prediction that is useful on human

191
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,790
timescales.

192
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,800
Whether an unusual in the sense that
statistically it's unusual.

193
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,440
Uh,
you could say it's just a statistical

194
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,820
anomalies,
statistical fluke.

195
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,670
There's no reason to think that
earthquakes are occurring any more

196
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,030
frequently now than they,
than they occurred last year or 10 years

197
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,420
ago or 10 years into the future.
There's no reason to believe that,

198
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,610
and it has nothing to do with global
warming.

199
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,470
Believe me,
that's a question that we often get.

200
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,890
Well,
one of the things we learned

201
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,240
seismologists is that earthquakes and
occurred anytime and any place,

202
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,530
in fact,
they don't even have to occur at plate

203
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,910
boundaries for that matter.
But that's,

204
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,760
that's a whole other topic.
Uh,

205
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,240
but along some of the major plate
boundaries like the Pacific northwest,

206
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,000
uh,
we have evidence of pastor earthquakes.

207
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,310
And that's actually,
it's an interesting thing.

208
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,120
Obviously we didn't have instruments
going back more than about a hundred

209
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,830
years or so.
So we don't have an instrumental record,

210
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,510
but we have a record from a newspaper,
old newspapers for example,

211
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,800
we have a record from some old mission
records,

212
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,920
particularly in California,
Spanish mission records and elsewhere

213
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,180
throughout the western hemisphere.

214
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,160
Uh,
we have very long,

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,300
uh,
historical records and China and Japan

216
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,520
and in parts of Asia where people have
been writing things down for quite a few

217
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,870
centuries.
Uh,

218
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,900
but in some places we simply don't have
that written record and we have to rely

219
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,450
again on proxies.
Um,

220
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,320
there are a couple of things we can do
in a place like California or Seattle,

221
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,820
the state,
California first.

222
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,430
Uh,
one thing we can do when we have a fault

223
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:55,080
like the San Andreas is to actually dig
a trench across that fault.

224
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,110
And when we trench across false like
that,

225
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,300
and you do that,
trenching it at different places,

226
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,660
you can actually see in the disturbed
soil the record of pastor earthquakes,

227
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:09,480
it may occur every hundred and 50 or 200
or three or 400 years,

228
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,120
uh,
but with very good carbon dating or

229
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,490
other geological techniques,
uh,

230
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,830
we can get a good sense of what that
history is.

231
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,980
And by doing that trenching at various
places along the fault,

232
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,910
we can even get a,
an estimate of the,

233
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:26,790
of the size of the rupture,
which gives us a way to calculate the

234
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,750
magnitude that then allows us to
calculate the repeat intervals,

235
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:34,170
say for these very large earthquakes in
Seattle,

236
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,720
or I should say more generally off the
coast of,

237
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,890
um,
uh,

238
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,680
British Columbia,
Washington and Oregon going down into

239
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:43,410
northern California.
That's a different kind of a plate

240
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,290
boundary.
It's what we call a subduction zone.

241
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,760
It's a convergent boundary.
It creates the cascades and the

242
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,200
volcanoes,
uh,

243
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,630
so we can't trench it.
Um,

244
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,660
but what we can do is look at the
history of uplift on the coast because

245
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,740
every time an earthquake occurs,
uh,

246
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,590
the upper plate,
which is basically the coast of

247
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:06,070
Washington and Oregon and northern
California gets bumped up a little bit.

248
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,650
And by looking at the sediment Terry
record,

249
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,540
actually sometimes it can go down as
well.

250
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,940
But you know,
at looking at the cinnamon Terry Record,

251
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,740
uh,
looking at the way,

252
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,450
say even trees or drowned by encroaching
water or lifted above the water table or

253
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,450
so on a,
you can get a sense of the history,

254
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,670
uh,
uh,

255
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,110
people who look at things like tree
rings or the history of corals,

256
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,590
the ornate corals up there now.
But if we go elsewhere around the world,

257
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:37,591
we see that these are all proxies for
past big earthquakes.

258
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
There's another proxy which,
um,

259
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,440
in particular for the Pacific Northwest
Works and that is,

260
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,470
uh,
earthquakes along that boundary have a

261
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:51,880
tendency to generate a tsunami.
And when it's an Ami,

262
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:55,450
propagates moot or moves across the
Pacific Ocean,

263
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,150
particularly a big one when it hits
islands,

264
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,800
uh,
on the other side of the Pacific,

265
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,890
uh,
you get what's called tsunami deposits.

266
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,200
It's a,
it's a very turbulent phenomenon,

267
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,160
brings up pebbles and rocks and disturbs
the beaches and,

268
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,080
uh,
you can detect some of those.

269
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,720
Um,
but in particularly for the,

270
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,780
for the particular case of the Pacific
northwest,

271
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,390
uh,
around 1700,

272
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,600
actually in 1700 a tsunami was
generated.

273
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,300
It was recorded in Japan.
And by looking at the tsunami records in

274
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,200
Japan,
both the historical record and the

275
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:37,201
actual geologic record of that tsunami
modelers have been able to kind of back

276
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:43,630
project that go backwards across the
Pacific show that the source of that

277
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,970
tsunami was in fact the Pacific
northwest,

278
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,190
and get a good date 1700,
uh,

279
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,890
for that event.
That event looks like to be about a

280
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,720
magnitude nine,
nine and a half.

281
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,870
That's bigger than what we had in Chile
last,

282
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,730
uh,
just a few weeks ago.

283
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,310
Uh,
and it's about as big as the biggest

284
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:02,350
earthquake we've recorded
instrumentally.

285
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,040
So now that we know that that boundary
can support a monstrous earthquake,

286
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,210
magnitude nine,
we can go about the job of measuring how

287
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,750
fast the plates are converging,
making some assumptions about how stress

288
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:21,010
is building up and come up with some
sense of what the repeat interval might

289
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,200
be for that earthquake.
And,

290
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,290
uh,
sad to say we're pretty close to the

291
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,110
repeat interval for that earthquake.
So that's a forecast.

292
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,910
It's not a prediction,
it's a forecast.

293
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,300
And thankfully,
at least in the United States going back

294
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,720
a decade or more,
uh,

295
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,940
seattle and Oregon had been well aware
of the potential for that earthquake and

296
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:43,300
they're taking the appropriate steps.
One would say to try to mitigate the

297
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:44,230
potential damage.

298
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,100
You know,
we,

299
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,250
we do talk about things like the big
one,

300
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,810
one in a little,
uh,

301
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,140
how big it will be,
what the impact will be.

302
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,760
A curious thing by the ways that it
we're getting better at predicting the

303
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:01,400
impact of an earthquake,
then we are actually predicting an

304
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,450
earthquake.
Now,

305
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,520
once we know,
uh,

306
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:04,354
that,
uh,

307
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,320
uh,
once we have a scenario earthquake for

308
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,420
example,
of a certain size,

309
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:12,080
a certain location,
our computer modeling really is very

310
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,120
good.
So we can actually,

311
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,470
uh,
with a computer generate the possible

312
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,810
ground motion from a scenario
earthquake.

313
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,040
We know how buildings interact with the
ground and what will cause a building to

314
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,420
fall down.
We even have a reasonable estimates of

315
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:32,260
the casualties that might arise and,
uh,

316
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,850
the economic damage as well.
Uh,

317
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,710
so we're getting very good at predicting
the damage.

318
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,380
Um,
and we've constructed such a scenario

319
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,430
for California.

320
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,090
And the reason for that is that over the
next few decades,

321
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,630
30 to 50 years,
the chance of having a major earthquake

322
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:49,370
in California,
uh,

323
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,490
is pretty close to one pretty close to
unity.

324
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,180
Um,
in some sense it's really safe for a

325
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,730
seismologist to say that because
earthquakes happen,

326
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,640
uh,
almost certainly a large earthquake is

327
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,250
going to happen in California.
So,

328
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,180
uh,
I'm,

329
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,220
you know,
I'm not sticking my neck out by saying

330
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:08,720
there's a good chance of an earthquake
happening,

331
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,140
but the question is how,
where it will be and how big it will be

332
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,180
and that we base on trenching.
We base on a,

333
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,160
base it on very fine measurements of the
crust moving.

334
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,800
Uh,
we have better calibrated models of the

335
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:25,490
faults and the frictions on the faults.
And so we're coming up with,

336
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,930
uh,
a sort of a community understanding of

337
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,730
what the big one might be.

338
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,090
Uh,
the US Geological Survey,

339
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,290
uh,
a,

340
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,140
an academic consortium called the
southern California earthquake center,

341
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:42,010
which actually involves seismologists
from all over the US,

342
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,750
if not the globe.
Uh,

343
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,720
I've come together with a consensus
statement that California rupture

344
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:52,721
forecast as it were.
And the two areas that are potentially

345
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:58,061
very dangerous are a repeat of a major
earthquake along the southern San Andres

346
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,240
east of Los Angeles,
but still close enough to do

347
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:06,630
considerable damage to Los Angeles.
And of course in the inland empire east,

348
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,650
uh,
basically along itn and going down

349
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,990
toward Palm Springs,
uh,

350
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,540
uh,
there's a good chance of significant

351
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:19,541
damage and significant casualties there.
The second area is up in the East Bay,

352
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,280
not a repeat of the 1906 earthquake,
which is on the,

353
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,750
which wasn't on this,
uh,

354
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,500
the San Francisco peninsula,
but in the East Bay and long something

355
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:30,110
called the hayward fault,
really part of the San Andrea system,

356
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,090
but a separate fault that's the fault
that colloquially you may remember sort

357
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,190
of runs right through the Berkeley
football stadium,

358
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,900
the hills above Berkeley and so on.

359
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,090
So,
you know,

360
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,940
cal might have difficulty feeling of
football team with that earthquake

361
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,370
occurs,
but nor predictions of damage there are

362
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,560
pretty severe as well.
Uh,

363
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,453
but again,
you know,

364
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,180
knowledge of what might happen and
particularly the damage that might

365
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,350
happen,
uh,

366
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,510
goes a great way to providing the
political will.

367
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,670
In fact,
the funding to do something about it

368
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,710
can't stop.
It can't stop an earthquake,

369
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,310
but it can build strong buildings.
You can prepare the population and you

370
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:08,070
can make people aware of what they might
do when they feel an earthquake.

371
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,550
Um,
and there are other steps we can take as

372
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,320
well.
Uh,

373
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,700
you know,
we can't predict,

374
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,950
uh,
we're getting better at forecasting,

375
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,940
but there's also something interesting
called earthquake early warning systems.

376
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,590
And this is something that,
um,

377
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,860
uh,
has taken a while to develop.

378
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,350
But when you think about it is kind of
obvious.

379
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,690
And when we start with the following
analogy,

380
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,970
uh,
earthquake waves that it in earthquake

381
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,800
occurs,
it generates ground motion.

382
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:41,550
That ground motion leaves the earthquake
zone and the rupture zone in a series of

383
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,920
waves.
And there are several types of waves and

384
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,140
the old move at different speeds.
We've,

385
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,480
you know,
some of our students learned that he's a

386
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,060
primary secondary surface waves and so
on.

387
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:55,050
And the primary words are very fast.
The secondary waves are slower and the

388
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,650
surface waves are slower still.
What's interesting about that,

389
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,340
that progression is that the primary or
waves though fast,

390
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,110
uh,
aren't very large.

391
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,530
Secondary waves are slower but larger.
And the surface waves slower,

392
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,140
still our largest still.
And so it's large ways that do most of

393
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:16,410
the damage.
So the theory is that if you could

394
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:19,380
detect that little bit of a p wave
coming along,

395
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,460
it's not going to do a lot of damage,
uh,

396
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,840
but uh,
might give you enough time ranging from

397
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,910
a few seconds,
a few tens of seconds,

398
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,253
uh,
to,

399
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,720
uh,
maybe even close to a minute or so or

400
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,710
more.
Uh,

401
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,310
it might give you enough time to do the
sort of things that would save people

402
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,410
safe structures.
Uh,

403
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,690
you could stop trains,
you could shut off gas,

404
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,973
uh,
you could,

405
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,300
uh,
get people to,

406
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:45,120
uh,
find safe haven inside the buildings for

407
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:46,410
example.
Uh,

408
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:49,740
if you could do that,
that would constitute a pretty decent

409
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:53,070
early warning system.
And so their experiments and trying to

410
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,270
do that,
it's been implemented.

411
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:56,160
Japan,
it's been implemented in Taiwan.

412
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,290
Um,
and,

413
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,010
uh,
there are,

414
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,680
uh,
other countries around trying to,

415
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,460
to investigate these systems.

416
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,670
You know,
preparing for an earthquake is

417
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,830
multifaceted,
multi dimensional.

418
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:13,920
And the first thing really is being
aware.

419
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,870
Uh,
yes,

420
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,060
I've said that earthquakes and occur
anywhere,

421
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,370
but they're more likely some places than
others.

422
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:23,970
So you know,
basic awareness of where your house,

423
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,240
where you work,
uh,

424
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,450
where you are relative to the faults
that might cause an earthquake.

425
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,510
That's a matter of public education.
Um,

426
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,110
but once you know what you're a risk
might be,

427
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,800
uh,
you have to make some sort of personal

428
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:44,430
judgment or if you're a government,
some sort of social judgment about the

429
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:47,950
level of risk that you're willing to
accept is going to be.

430
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,570
And if you're willing to accept or only
willing to accept a low level of risk,

431
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,580
then there are a number of things you
need to do,

432
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,050
you to ensure that major infrastructure
is resilient,

433
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,210
that our water lines are power lines are
built in such a way so that they won't

434
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:07,660
break that bridges and highways one fall
down.

435
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,020
That fire stations will remain standing
so that the fire personnel can respond

436
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,300
and that hospitals remain standing,
um,

437
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,690
with respect to individuals in their
homes.

438
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,610
Uh,
if you're an earthquake zone,

439
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,340
ensuring that your building is up to
code,

440
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,770
if a code exists,
um,

441
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,960
ensuring that you follow that code and
even little things like keeping the

442
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:33,850
knickknacks away from the edge of the
shelf,

443
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,580
keeping your dishes way back.
Those are the sorts of things that could

444
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:41,581
make the difference between sort of a Ho
hum boy was that an interesting event to

445
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:44,570
something that was a disaster.
Um,

446
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,890
and these are all written down.
You can go to the fema websites,

447
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,090
USG,
s websites.

448
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,100
There were a whole list of these things.
The problem arises when first you don't

449
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,640
have building codes,
uh,

450
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,650
or those codes aren't enforced.
That was a situation in Haiti where you

451
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:04,651
don't have the national or social wealth
to actually consider this something you

452
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:05,590
can do.

453
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,670
I mean,
they're the,

454
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,280
and I don't mean to bring up Haiti
constantly,

455
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:13,720
but the issue there was that there were
so many sort of day to day problems

456
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:16,660
facing a Haiti culture in Haiti
government.

457
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,170
That's something that might happen,
uh,

458
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,380
really can't get on the radar screen.
And you could argue the right or wrong

459
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:26,290
to that.
But that basically is a situation and

460
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,420
sad to say that's tap us throughout the
world.

461
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,540
Um,
so you know,

462
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,470
the basic things really quite easy to do
if you've got the money to do them and

463
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:38,530
if you've got the public awareness to do
them and if you've got the political

464
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:41,140
will to do them.
If you're dealing with the Commons,

465
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:44,080
if you're dealing with infrastructure,
uh,

466
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,960
where you don't have the political will
or the wealth,

467
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,080
uh,
there are a number of things that the

468
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,220
community is trying to do.

469
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,230
There's a lot of concentration on
building small scale community awareness

470
00:22:56,231 --> 00:23:00,910
so that the awareness of disaster,
the awareness of potential disaster I

471
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,740
should say,
uh,

472
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,830
occurs almost at the household level and
enabling people to make decisions but

473
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,140
also giving them sort of the simple
things that they,

474
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,810
that they could do on a day to day
basis.

475
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Uh,
not just for earthquakes but for floods,

476
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,210
for landslides.
Uh,

477
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,470
and for that matter,
for longer term issues like sea level

478
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,690
rise and climate change.
Uh,

479
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,920
you know,
one of the,

480
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,920
one of the key things that we're doing
at our institute and elsewhere is trying

481
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:33,550
to,
to bring the knowledge we have about

482
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:36,060
earth processes near.
So dynamic planet.

483
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,380
It's fun to look at.
We enjoy doing that,

484
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,160
but it affects people.
And one of the things we're trying to do

485
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:46,310
is to bring that knowledge,
not just throw it over the fence so that

486
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,640
policy makers can use it because you
know,

487
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,630
there's none of a feedback and that kind
of a system.

488
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,490
Uh,
we really,

489
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,410
scientists need to understand social and
cultural constraints on using the

490
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:00,650
information and in fact,
even the utility of the information that

491
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:04,070
they provide.
And if I may say,

492
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:09,071
I think the social scientists and
governments and ngos need to know what

493
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:12,140
they don't know and that's a difficult
task.

494
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,020
Uh,
but to be honest,

495
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,680
it's an interesting and important thing
to do and we're getting better at it.

496
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,980
You know,
she'll use a particularly interesting

497
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,140
earthquake from a psychological point of
view of,

498
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,460
first of all,
of course it's very large,

499
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,810
a magnitude 8.8.
Uh,

500
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,510
so we would call a great earthquake
where we use great in terms of the wow

501
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:36,530
factor,
if you will.

502
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,650
Uh,
it did kill 700 people,

503
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,380
thereabouts.
It caused billions,

504
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,071
tens of billions of dollars worth of
damage.

505
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,500
So the economic impact in Chile,
he was going to be severe.

506
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,970
Uh,
but we don't get a magnitude 8.8 very

507
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,800
often.
The only reason,

508
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:55,120
by the way,
there weren't more casualties and chelay

509
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,520
and more damage and chill a's that the
earthquake was off the coast.

510
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:02,210
It was in the subduction zone.
It generates an Ami as we saw.

511
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,550
Uh,
but it wasn't a direct hit.

512
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,030
Uh,
but being anywhere close to an 8.8 is

513
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:10,610
enough of a hit to be dangerous.
And that's what happened in Chile.

514
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,550
But it was the result of a subduction
zone.

515
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,610
It's part of what a seismologist call
this certain Pacific seismic belt

516
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,490
earthquake belt.
It's what's colloquially known as the

517
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,200
Pacific Ring of fire.
Uh,

518
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:29,201
that's actually a great name because
indeed the Pacific is rimmed is ringed

519
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,900
by these subduction zones.
When a subduction zone means that the

520
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,870
heavier,
denser crust of the Pacific Ocean basin

521
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,300
is essentially diving under the lighter,
less dense crust of the continence

522
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,120
surrounding,
um,

523
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,790
and as it dives underneath that it
sticks and slips and causes earthquakes.

524
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,930
Um,
roughly 70 or 80% of the world's biggest

525
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:55,860
earthquakes occur.
And the Pacific Ring of fire,

526
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:56,301
it's,
you know,

527
00:25:56,301 --> 00:26:00,170
it's a gigantic source of tectonic
energy of earthquake energy.

528
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,420
Uh,
the other interesting thing about that,

529
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:03,950
by the way,
and the reason it's called the ring of

530
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:06,020
fire is because,
uh,

531
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,970
as he's plates dive down underneath the
lighter continent pieces of the melt,

532
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,510
and that melt becomes magma that just
drives up through what we call the

533
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:19,280
mantle and the crust and creates
volcanoes.

534
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,500
So it's,
it's kind of part of a,

535
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,443
a,
a,

536
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,970
uh,
an ecological recycling mechanism going

537
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,470
on.
You're taking old crust,

538
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,050
throwing it out,
sending it down the subduction zone,

539
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:33,590
recycling it into new material,
just like you throw a paper bag into the

540
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,260
garbage or the recycling bin.
Um,

541
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,410
so that's the basics of the tectonic
activity.

542
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,810
Uh,
these earthquakes tend to be very large

543
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:42,880
because,
uh,

544
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,950
these are,
uh,

545
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:47,340
large plates.
The continence present a significant

546
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:50,790
barrier to subduction in many cases.
Uh,

547
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,070
and it takes a long time for stress to
build up.

548
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,520
One interesting thing is that we knew
about this,

549
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,710
this problem in Chile of course for a
long time.

550
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,580
And of course the Chileans who have an
extraordinarily advanced and

551
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,790
professional capacity to deal with
earthquakes,

552
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,470
uh,
knew about this as well.

553
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,510
But,
uh,

554
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,840
20 or 30 years ago,
using very simple components of the

555
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,880
plate tectonic theory,
uh,

556
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:18,060
this particular area was identified as a
so called seismic gap,

557
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,930
a place where an earthquake was
basically overdue.

558
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,850
Uh,
couldn't predict it,

559
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,700
but we could forecast it.
And that's what in some sense,

560
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:27,534
save Chile.

561
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,380
Now,
large earthquakes do strange things.

562
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,160
Um,
uh,

563
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,980
of course what an earthquake does is,
uh,

564
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,440
in addition to breaking the ground,
it actually moves big crustal blocks

565
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:45,120
around.
And when it does that,

566
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,110
it shifts the distribution of mass of
the earth.

567
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,730
Now,
uh,

568
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,170
because this wasn't an asteroid or a
comet hitting the earth and causing all

569
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:58,530
these vibrations,
the earth has to conserve its angular

570
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:03,450
momentum and the way the earth conserves
its angular momentum when crustal blocks

571
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:08,451
shift like that is to change the rate of
rotation and to slightly shift the axis

572
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,050
of rotation.
It can be calculated,

573
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,230
but it really isn't measurable.
On the other hand,

574
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:18,990
if you're being paid by the microsecond,
maybe it's something that you might

575
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,850
worry about.
Uh,

576
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,820
but the interesting thing is that we can
calculate it.

577
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,730
Not that it is in fact something we got
to worry about

578
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,320
a hand.

579
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,390
He's a different kind of an animal,
but it,

580
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,330
it,
it pays to think about what's really

581
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,970
happening around South America.
Uh,

582
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
the Chilean event,
a subduction event,

583
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,630
uh,
was a seduction of a piece of the

584
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:47,790
Pacific plate in this case called the
Nazca plate,

585
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,190
but a piece,
a smaller plate going underneath.

586
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,910
I know he Chile underneath the Pacific
Ring of fire.

587
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,130
And so this is a case where the
continent and the Pacific Ocean are

588
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,100
sliding,
are,

589
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,000
are converging against each other in the
Pacific diving down.

590
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,500
Because it,
because it's denser.

591
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,760
But if you look at the northern and
southern parts of South America,

592
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,130
picture it in your mind.
Um,

593
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,090
you've got the Caribbean to the north.
Of course you've got the Scotia seat of

594
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:16,890
the south between South America and aunt
artica.

595
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,500
And those are two very interesting
plates.

596
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,180
Uh,
you know,

597
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:26,181
in some sense he can think about those
plates as resulting from the squirt of

598
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,900
material in geologic time going around
South America.

599
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,530
So if you can't sub duct this stuff,
you can't get everything underneath

600
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:38,790
South America through subduction.
That stuff has to go someplace and it

601
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,290
goes north and south and sort of squirts
around.

602
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,630
And the Caribbean plate is one of these
plates.

603
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:47,740
I've got squirted through the gap
between North and South America.

604
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,580
Uh,
of course it's,

605
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,480
it's a vast simplification,
but it's actually the way we,

606
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,060
we teach it.
It's kind of a fun thing to think about.

607
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
Um,
and so that the Caribbean is actually

608
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:00,210
itself a small plate.
Um,

609
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,080
it is a significant part of plate
tectonics.

610
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,570
It was will recognize as a plate,
uh,

611
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:09,460
but it's been basically squirting past
South America between North and South

612
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:14,440
America,
going from west to east and it's moving

613
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,950
at a little less than an inch a year
relative to North America.

614
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,750
Now,
the unfortunate thing for Haiti is that

615
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:27,070
for geologic reasons,
Haiti lies along the northern boundary.

616
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,520
And because this is a squirt boundary
going from west to east,

617
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,400
uh,
that is what we call a strike slip

618
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,560
fault.
It's a fault that moves sideways.

619
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,660
There's some complexities to that,
but that fault was also recognized as

620
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:44,650
being capable of supporting a magnitude
seven or greater earthquake.

621
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,860
Actually 7.2,
uh,

622
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,820
in fact,
that forecast was made in the

623
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:52,270
professional literature in 2008,
two years ago.

624
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,460
Um,
and,

625
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:57,850
and we've known for about 20 years at
that fault was dangerous anyway.

626
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:00,550
That wasn't a subduction earthquake.
That was a sliding earthquake and

627
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:04,450
sliding earthquakes strikes slipper
earthquakes or dangerous also for a

628
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,160
number of reasons.
Uh,

629
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:09,560
first of all,
they tend not to be as large as a

630
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,190
subduction earthquake,
but it can be large enough.

631
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,571
Uh,
they also,

632
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,290
in this particular case,
they occurred on land and unfortunately

633
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,900
the,
it was almost a direct hit on

634
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,753
port-au-prince.

635
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,220
The earthquake itself was shallow,
which increases the amount of vibration

636
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,470
that people on the surface feel.
Uh,

637
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,410
and it was very close to major
population centers.

638
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,980
So if you will,
it was sort of the perfect storm of bad

639
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,930
effect.
Uh,

640
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,890
even if Chile had good building codes
and good construction,

641
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:44,920
I think we would have seen tens of
thousands of casualties anyway,

642
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,860
very difficult to deal with an
earthquake of that sort,

643
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,900
but it was a different kind of an
animal.

644
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,660
Um,
we've looked at the Chilean earthquake

645
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,940
in many ways and we continue to do so.
In fact,

646
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:57,820
there are a number of conferences coming
up in the next few days,

647
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,030
uh,
to try to move to the next phase of

648
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,220
Chili rebuilding and sort of essentially
make the,

649
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,370
the rebuilding of Chili more risk
conscious,

650
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,630
not just for earthquakes,
but for the storm's coming up and the

651
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,640
annual storm season,
the annual hurricane season and

652
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,170
concomitant landslides and other natural
hazards.

653
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,230
Um,
but you know,

654
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:23,880
trying to understand these,
uh,

655
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,590
earthquakes on land,
these strikes of earthquakes,

656
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,740
it's a very complex problem.
Uh,

657
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,250
and one of the things that were very
worried about in Haiti is that this

658
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,890
earthquake may have stressed parts of
the fault that did not rupture on

659
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,570
January 12th.
Uh,

660
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,291
you know,
when a,

661
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,140
when an earthquake happens,
it doesn't zip open the whole fault and

662
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:52,130
only sips open this case about a 40
kilometer segment of it.

663
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,210
And there's still stuff on each side
that did not rupture well,

664
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,510
that stuff may have been overstressed.
That piece of the fault may have been

665
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,140
overstressed.
And so the potential for an earthquake

666
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,230
on those segments may actually have
increased.

667
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,300
That again,
is a computer model.

668
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,740
It's something that we're working on.
Uh,

669
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,210
it is hard to predict,
uh,

670
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,340
but it is something that as a forecast
ought to play into the way Haiti's being

671
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:21,620
rebuilt.
Um,

672
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,720
Chile,
we could do the same thing,

673
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,580
but to be honest,
uh,

674
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,370
Chile,
apart from the economic damage and the

675
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:31,160
economic recovery,
Chile has a,

676
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,630
a good capacity to deal with future
earthquakes and the outcomes of this

677
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,400
earthquake.
With Haiti.

678
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,850
Uh,
I hope that the international community

679
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:44,570
will work with the Haitians to build
that capacity so that they can monitor

680
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,030
the potential for these future
earthquakes.

681
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,591
Well,
you know,

682
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,500
obviously the public has a great
interest in earthquake happens and so we

683
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,450
do our best,
best we can.

684
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,060
Uh,
the questions tend to be repetitive.

685
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,060
Um,
almost always we get a question from

686
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:05,990
somebody about whether they can come see
the Richter scale.

687
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,790
Do we have an example of the Richter
scale?

688
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,220
Uh,
the Richter scale is a mathematical

689
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:11,410
calculation.
In fact,

690
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,060
psychologists don't use it anymore.
The only reason we give a rector of

691
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,650
magnitude,
frankly,

692
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:18,170
is for the press and the media.
But we have much better ways of

693
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,760
measuring the energy of an earthquake
now.

694
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,700
But the second question that's cropped
up and,

695
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,340
um,
it's fascinating in its own right,

696
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,980
is that,
uh,

697
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,630
the first time I heard it,
I thought it was a fluke,

698
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,510
uh,
but I've heard it so many times since

699
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,820
Haiti that I wonder what's going on.
And that is,

700
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,420
are these earthquakes related to global
warming?

701
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,780
Uh,
I'm serious about that.

702
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,410
I,
I'd say that most of the press and most

703
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:49,400
of the public that have called in that,
that didn't have specific domain

704
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,510
knowledge,
uh,

705
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,970
has asked us that question.
Uh,

706
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,340
we also get questions whether,
you know,

707
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,860
uh,
2012 is coming a couple of years early.

708
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,970
Uh,
we get that sort of thing.

709
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,990
It's just the end of days.
But I think it speaks to something more

710
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:05,030
interesting,
which is that,

711
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,360
uh,
earthquakes and major disasters,

712
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,680
uh,
have a certain impact on the public

713
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:15,350
consciousness.
And I think earthquakes more so,

714
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:18,380
or even volcanic eruptions more so than,
than anything else.

715
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,671
Uh,
you know,

716
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:22,280
we get a major hurricane,
a few major hurricanes every year.

717
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,630
We get floods every year.
Uh,

718
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,190
their major disasters that cause more
norms,

719
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,210
norms,
amount of economic damage and

720
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,200
casualties.
Uh,

721
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,510
but yet we hear about them relatively
often.

722
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,670
And so we kind of think of that as kind
of background.

723
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,760
This is what the earth is doing to us.
But earthquakes,

724
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,770
especially major ones,
are relatively rare.

725
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:46,900
We get a few major ones that decade,
uh,

726
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,810
particularly ones with huge numbers of
casualties and the concept of an

727
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:54,420
earthquake,
that it shakes the firmament,

728
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,010
that,
that,

729
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,910
that it removes your footing,
that it could destroy everything in a

730
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,580
blink of an eye.
And that it is unpredictable,

731
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,220
that it just happens.
Uh,

732
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,330
even if you're rational in a scientific
way,

733
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,260
uh,
even if you're a rational and even a

734
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:14,850
theological sort of way,
you get to,

735
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,630
it has to have some impact.
Um,

736
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,950
you know,
the,

737
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,060
the response,
the scientific response to the Chilean

738
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,110
earthquake,
all the modulator,

739
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:29,111
it a bit by the damage and by the
casualties still was this is a major

740
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,130
earthquake.
We've got to look at this as well as we

741
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:34,500
can because we only get a couple of
shots of decades.

742
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,670
Look at it.
So now there are teams of scientists and

743
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,640
lots of instrumentation going to Chile.
Uh,

744
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:45,120
but when you get down to Haiti or
something like Haiti,

745
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,150
uh,
when you get a directed on a capital

746
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:53,151
city,
when the bulk of the nation is affected,

747
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,920
where you have damaged that far exceeds,
uh,

748
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,710
their economic ability to come back.
Uh,

749
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,560
coupled with the fact that an earthquake
literally moves the ground on which you

750
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,400
cited a,
you start asking basic questions like,

751
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,770
should I even be here?
Should I be living here?

752
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,980
Do I have to move?
What is,

753
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,400
what is the future of my country?
What does the future of my city?

754
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,090
And those are the sorts of questions
that I think have such a big impact on

755
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:26,490
the public that,
uh,

756
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,730
by necessity I think we've got to talk
about them.

757
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,380
We've got to talk about what it means.

758
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,620
I think science is somewhat ill equipped
to do that.

759
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,630
We,
we quantify everything.

760
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,320
We enumerate the energies,
the displacements,

761
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,140
the ground motion.
Uh,

762
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,650
we have,
uh,

763
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,010
we have technology and we have lingo,
but none of this relates to somebody

764
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:52,410
who's asking the question.
Uh,

765
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,960
my house was destroyed.
Where should I move?

766
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,200
Uh,
and it relates of course in a very

767
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,430
quantitative,
scientific way.

768
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,260
But how do you,
how do you approach that person?

769
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:06,261
How do you assure them that the
situation has a rational response?

770
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,240
And I don't think we have a good way to
deal with that.

771
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,310
So a lot of the questions we were
getting and a lot of the,

772
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:16,560
uh,
the thinking that generated,

773
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,520
uh,
had to do with these central questions

774
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:24,270
of what does this mean in particularly
for the future of Haiti?

775
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:29,070
But what does this mean when we talk
about taking steps to mitigate against

776
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,840
future tragedy,
future disasters,

777
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,300
not just for earthquakes.

778
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,470
So for the other major natural disasters
as well.

779
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,140
And uh,
to me that,

780
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,820
and too many of us,
I should say,

781
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,850
uh,
it's not that we haven't thought about

782
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,300
this before,
but it seems to me to be an area,

783
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,360
not just of research,
but of so sort of a way to link directly

784
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,550
to the public directly to the people who
need to understand what it is we're

785
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,220
doing as scientists.
Uh,

786
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,460
you know,
I could,

787
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,270
I could make the same sort of arguing
about climate change for example,

788
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,170
but,
uh,

789
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,100
earthquake serve,
I use a phrase,

790
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,410
and I don't mean to use it lightly,
but,

791
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,530
uh,
earthquake service training days for the

792
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:18,970
major environmental disasters,
major environmental stresses that our

793
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,620
planet faces.
And if we can begin to address how we

794
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:26,470
relate to the public,
how we provide assurance,

795
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,740
how we,
uh,

796
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,990
help the public to understand what it is
that happening in them.

797
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,990
If we can understand how to do that for
major earthquakes or major hurricanes a,

798
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,140
then perhaps we can do something about
stuff that's even more merger,

799
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,380
the major more in the future,
more emergent,

800
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,870
uh,
more probabilistic,

801
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,350
uh,
where we actually might have a chance in

802
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:52,420
modifying our behavior to do something
about it.

803
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,860
So
what I've taken away from this

804
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,070
interaction from Haiti and it's,
and Chile and I must've been,

805
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:04,660
it's not new to this earthquake.
We've had it before with the Indonesian

806
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,170
earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami.
Uh,

807
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,190
we've seen it in earthquakes going as
far back as the 80s and the 70s,

808
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:15,040
and places like Armenia and China.
And so on.

809
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,570
But what we've taken away from this,
um,

810
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,590
is that there's a conversation that
scientists have to have with the public

811
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,610
that the public will regard as deeply
meaningful,

812
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,810
which means we can't just throw our
results over the fence.

813
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:35,050
We can't just stick with our technical
journals.

814
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,560
There's gotta be some other mechanism.
And

815
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,670
in my view,
I think universities where,

816
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,120
uh,
we ascribed to liberal thinking,

817
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,000
the small l liberal,
uh,

818
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,380
you know,
we ought to better,

819
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,480
it'd be a good place to do it.
Uh,

820
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,060
and I,
I think the universities have that kind

821
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:59,170
of role to play beyond the roles that
governments and other social

822
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:00,130
institutions play.

823
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,320
Yeah,
no.

824
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,760
Uh,
it's the rarest seismologists as hasn't

825
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,510
experienced an earthquake.
We call them theoreticians,

826
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,100
by the way.
Um,

827
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:12,581
but,
uh,

828
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,110
yeah,
I've experienced earthquakes,

829
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,910
uh,
nothing larger than about a magnitude

830
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:17,620
six.
Um,

831
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,250
and of course I've been an aftershock
zones where magnitude fours and fives

832
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,810
are fairly,
fairly frequent,

833
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,620
uh,
and you take steps to deal with it.

834
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,500
Uh,
but it's very difficult for me to

835
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,470
imagine what it would be like in an 8.8.
I mean we,

836
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,090
or even a 7.0,
that was a direct hit.

837
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,900
Uh,
I personally feel fortunate that I

838
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:42,080
haven't been in that.
And I sometimes joke with my colleagues,

839
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,180
that's why I work in New York and not in
California.

840
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,180
But on the other hand,
um,

841
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:51,380
you know,
we understand earthquakes in the

842
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:56,381
abstract and the visceral feel of an
earthquake is something that perhaps

843
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,100
might contribute to the conversation we
need to have with the public.

844
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,750
And maybe there ought to be a program to
get a lot of seismologists into

845
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:08,090
earthquake zones that they can
understand what it's like.

846
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:10,820
I'm,
I'm only half of specious there.

847
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,090
Uh,
but to experience an earthquake is to

848
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:17,600
know what it means to somebody who may
not be a seismologist,

849
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,060
who has a house,
has just been destroyed,

850
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,060
who has a livelihood that has
disappeared,

851
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,000
uh,
and has a government that's in shambles.

852
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,850
And,
uh,

853
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,250
maybe all we can do is extrapolate,
but I think it's,

854
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,440
it's something necessary to think about.
