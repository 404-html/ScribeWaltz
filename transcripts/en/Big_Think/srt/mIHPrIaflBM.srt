1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,113
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,360
it might be the greatest task facing,
say the next American president on the

3
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:17,100
foreign policy realm is to reestablish
the moral authority of the United States

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,590
as a human rights actor.
Now,

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,870
I don't want to overstate the case that
the US does still have an important

6
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:27,200
voice say to stop genocide.
Um,

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,240
the US has actually been an important
rhetorical voice under four because the

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,350
United States does not commit mass
murder.

9
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,184
It's not,
you know,

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,800
ethnically cleansing hundreds of
thousands of people.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,300
So in that sense,
there is still some residual moral

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,020
authority to the United States.
The US can also credibly promote

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,500
democracy because,
you know,

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,350
whatever flaws we have in the United
States,

15
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:53,490
it still is a credible democracy,
but the US cannot,

16
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,390
with a straight face promote the fight
against torture,

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,340
fight against foreseeable disappearance,
the fight against arbitrary detention

18
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,410
and the fight against unfair trials
because these are all abuses that the

19
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,960
Bush administration is practiced in the
name of fighting terrorism.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,380
So the real challenge facing a new
government is to end those practices,

21
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,370
to repudiate them,
to hold the author's accountable in some

22
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:21,060
meaningful way.
And to recommit the United States to

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,730
serious respect for human rights,
even in the tough moments,

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,530
even when the US is at threat.
And in doing that,

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
I think that the United States can
reclaim its position as one of the

26
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,360
leaders,
if not the leader of the human rights

27
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:40,140
movement at the governmental level.
That is absolutely essential.

28
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,200
I think in the longterm,
if the human rights movement is to have

29
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,380
the power that is enjoyed in an earlier
era.
