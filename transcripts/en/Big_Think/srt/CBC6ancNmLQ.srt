1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,200
First of all,
I like to say that you're my favorite

2
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:12,050
person ever in the world,
but my question is,

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,560
do you think we can build our own
monitor day?

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,950
I'm Frankenstein,
like sewing together body parts and

5
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:23,951
somehow reanimating it.
Do you think that's possible because you

6
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:27,830
seem like the person to ask this anyway.
Thank you so much.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,150
I hope to see a big think

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,940
reanimating people from different body
parts.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,000
Probably not,
but something even more amazing is about

10
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,990
to happen in biology and genetics.
Well,

11
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:49,991
one cliff point of clarification.
Dr. Frankenstein created what came to be

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,470
called Frankenstein's monster.
The monster himself was not really

13
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,850
called Frankenstein.
Just a little,

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,580
a little science fiction point of
interest there.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,720
So,
uh,

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,560
what will probably happen in your
lifetime,

17
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:11,561
just judging how old you appear on big
thing is people will be able people like

18
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:16,661
you will be able to regenerate parts of
your body using your own cells that a

19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,470
technologists in medicine and genetics
are finding ways to get your own body,

20
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:30,080
to create more cells that it wouldn't,
that it didn't use to be able to create.

21
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,620
Like if you need a new pancreas,
you'll be able to grow your own

22
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:36,830
pancreas.
And I don't know about complex

23
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,920
mechanical systems like hands and
fingers,

24
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,390
but it doesn't seem beyond,
uh,

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,160
uh,
the technology that's being developed

26
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:51,161
right now because in my lifetime,
people came to appreciate the

27
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:54,050
significance of stem cells.

28
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,210
These are cells that are,
uh,

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,650
have plenty of potential.
They can be anything when you're a

30
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:04,790
blastocyst,
before you become a take on the form of

31
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,791
a human or what have you.
So the acronym is Crispr and the,

32
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,800
uh,
I know the p there is palindrome

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,890
Palindromic,
which is the same at both ends,

34
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:20,210
the same backwards and forwards.
And so people are being or finding ways,

35
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:24,530
geneticists are finding ways to get
cells to do whatever they want,

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,610
whenever they want them to do.
And it's presumed that instead of making

37
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:33,611
a monster akin to Dr Frankenstein's
fictional creature by assembling pieces

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,320
of from disparate other humans.
Instead,

39
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:44,321
you'd get each person's own cells to
create a regenerate body parts or,

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,513
or,
um,

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,010
maybe in,
in the,

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,960
in the womb,
create extraordinary people that were

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,320
extraordinarily smart with extraordinary
skills and dunking basketballs or have

44
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:01,630
you,
but the idea of taking your

45
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:06,631
consciousness and putting it in another
device or another system or another

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,150
biological,
another person,

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,320
another biological system is something
has been around for a long time.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Science fiction has got it for a long
time and I'm always charmed by the

49
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:25,351
singularity when brains,
when computers are going to be as

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,330
complex and sophisticated as a human
brain and uh,

51
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,910
that this,
this moment in history is called the

52
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,880
singularity.
And then you'll just download all of

53
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:40,930
your memories and all of your
experiences into this electronic

54
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,670
presumed electronic storage system.
And then you would live as long as

55
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,280
you're plugged in,
as long as you have electricity,

56
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,060
what have you.
It just seems way more complicated than

57
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:55,330
that.
And not something I would ever count on.

58
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,050
And I don't think you can really be a
whole person in the way it.

59
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:07,450
You seem to be here on camera without
your census,

60
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,530
without your eyes,
ears,

61
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,660
nose,
and so on,

62
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,040
feeling the world around you,
so called your,

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,250
your so called central nervous system,
which is part of your brain.

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,120
I don't think it's that simple to put a
brain in another body and carry on or

65
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,060
put your consciousness and electrical
receptacle and carry on,

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,600
but you may be living at a time when
extraordinary things will be done with

67
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:36,481
your own cells that will far surpass
anything that Dr. Frankenstein in the

68
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:42,520
story was able to do.
It's exciting.

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,200
Carry on.
