1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,390
So for 300 years in this country,
there was really no such thing as fair

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,010
food,
meaning that there was no way to

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:13,011
recognize from a consumer's purchases
that workers were treated well in the

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,431
thirties,
forties,

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,890
and fifties.
A movement started in California,

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,010
lead eventually by Dolores Huerta and
Cesar Chavez that morphed into the

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,190
United Farm Workers Union and people of
a certain age,

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,730
my age and above,
um,

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,780
can remember not eating grapes or
lettuce in the seventies because of the

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:38,520
nationwide boycotts against produce that
wasn't picked fairly,

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,740
that wasn't picked in those days by
union members.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,500
Now,
unions have been decimated all across

13
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,420
the countries and the eighties and
nineties.

14
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:50,421
Most of the union protections that were
won by farm workers were rolled back.

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,130
Farmworkers have two things against
them.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,580
Number one,
in many states,

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,590
most workers can't unionize without the
fear of losing their job.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,820
In Florida,
for example,

19
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:05,670
it's a right to work state,
which means euphemistically,

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,700
that if you decide to unionize,
your employer can fire you just for

21
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,170
that.

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,260
In California,
for example,

23
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,320
they can't fire you because you are
trying to organize a union.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,190
Secondly,
according to the National Labor

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,900
Standards Act that was set in 1938 by
FDR that set the minimum wage

26
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,480
requirements for workers all across the
country,

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,610
farm workers were the exception.
Farm workers and domestic workers were

28
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:36,210
predominantly African American,
and in order for Fdr to pass that bill,

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,190
he needed the support of the southern
Democrats who refuse to let their

30
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,630
African Americans have the same rights
that workers all across the nation we're

31
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,270
having,
so farm workers and domestic workers

32
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,990
were excluded from that.
So fast forward to the present,

33
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,700
day and age,
there are no unions.

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,440
Farm workers aren't really protected by
national labor laws.

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,140
They definitely aren't entitled to
overtime.

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,700
And what that means is that for consumer
who's asking themselves,

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
is my food fair?
The answer 99 point nine,

38
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:12,230
nine,
nine,

39
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,350
nine,
nine percent of the time is either no or

40
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,520
there's no way to tell.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,240
My film.
Food chains focuses on one small group

42
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,660
of workers from central Florida.
Southern Florida really called the

43
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,520
coalition of immokalee workers.
Amockley isn't a native American word,

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,140
which means our home and it's a little
tiny labor camp in southern Florida

45
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:38,640
right next to Naples and I call it a
labor camp because it's got a um,

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,080
wintertime population of 40,000 people
when the harvest is in full swing,

47
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,110
but there is no city council.
There's no mayor,

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
there's no real infrastructure in that
city and it's only 15 miles away from

49
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,190
the richest zip code in America,
Naples.

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,640
So in Macula is a labor camp.
And in that little labor camp,

51
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:04,120
some of the worst atrocities in this
country have happened from modern day

52
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:09,040
slavery to sexual harassment,
to really her really horrific crimes in

53
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,920
the field,
but a little group called the ciw.

54
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,460
The coalition of immokalee workers
created a program called the fair food

55
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,294
program.

56
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,390
And that fair food program is really the
only program in the United States that

57
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,481
absolutely guarantees that workers in
the field earn more than sub poverty

58
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,820
level wages and are entitled to a
complete spectrum of human rights

59
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:37,000
guarantees.
They've gotten 12 major retailers to

60
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,330
sign onto that program.
And what that means in simple terms is

61
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,550
that if you go to Walmart,
whole foods,

62
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,640
trader Joe's,
if you eat it almost any fast food

63
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:49,390
restaurant in America,
except one ds in the wintertime,

64
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,990
most likely your tomato is from that
program.

65
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,590
It's a fair food tomato.
So if you want to eat fair,

66
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,290
you can go to whole foods,
you can go to Walmart.

67
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,110
Surprisingly,
you can go to trader Joe's and buy their

68
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,260
Florida tomatoes.
That's the only product in the entire

69
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:10,261
United States that's absolutely
guaranteed out a doubt to be fair labor.
