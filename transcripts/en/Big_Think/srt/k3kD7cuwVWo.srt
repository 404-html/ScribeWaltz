1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,190
Grandmothers ravioli.
There's something I was doing for years.

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:14,100
I was doing there,
my cafe balloons and I started them as a

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,870
Sunday special,
uh,

4
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,000
just cause it seemed,
you know,

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:23,001
within that context of kind of French
American international kind of flavors

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,880
to have something on Sunday that was
kind of comforting.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,220
Um,
are they my grandmother's wherever you

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,090
all these.
Exactly.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,480
No,
I mean she never used short ribs in them

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,100
and uh,
you know,

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,800
didn't use fresh tomato for the sauce.
Uh,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,640
it's kind of like an in quotes,
inspiration type of thing.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,690
Um,
but I'm Italian and Polish and,

14
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,370
uh,
that's uh,

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,650
you know,
to good cooking cuisines.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,880
Um,
one doesn't have a lot of vegetables in

17
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:53,730
it,
the other one does,

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,930
but it's,
uh,

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,810
you know,
to kind of good cooking cultures,

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,230
Italian restaurant.
So I want to keep it in Italian,

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,710
in spirit.
You know,

22
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,720
uptown.
When I was the chef at cafe blue,

23
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:11,554
I had,
uh,

24
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,450
I had some,
my grandmother's parole,

25
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:17,740
he's on the menu
and they were pretty good.

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,000
Uh,
they,

27
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,650
uh,
they got some,

28
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,790
you know,
they got some mentions.

29
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,860
I didn't really promote them or
anything.

30
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,270
They just put them on the menu just
because I wanted to make some,

31
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,490
and they were a little bit fancy.
Um,

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,540
it was like three different flavors.
And I made a sauce with the juice from

33
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,280
the Sauerkraut,
homemade Sauerkraut,

34
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,790
and it had like poppy seeds and Julian
apple and stuff like that on it.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,420
So it was kind of like a fancy version
of the progress that we used to buy when

36
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:45,040
I was a kid at the parochial church,
which was down the street.

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
It's an interesting little,

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,900
uh,
a similar thing,

39
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,700
but the routines,
which are the eye,

40
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,180
the half my town and families from
Friuli and they were a French family

41
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:10,181
that immigrated from Paris to freely in
the mid 18 hundreds.

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,470
Uh,
so my grandmother was half French and,

43
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,910
uh,
she also,

44
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:20,470
uh,
spoke highly of people like the scuff ea

45
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,300
had all these stories,
kind of mixed it in there.

46
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,700
[inaudible].
