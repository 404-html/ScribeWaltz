1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,190
Our brains are cunningly evolved
cunningly designed to make life easier

2
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:25,451
for us and many ways that it makes life
easier for us.

3
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:30,710
But one of them is that it,
it gives us over simplified versions of,

4
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,900
of,
of what we're doing.

5
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,550
Uh,
uh,

6
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:38,750
this is a set of tricks which has been a
sort of reinvented by software

7
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,300
engineers.
Your desktop is a pretty good case of

8
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,620
it.
We have these,

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,230
you know,
little little yellow files that can be

10
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:48,650
moved around with click and drag and,
and things get put here and there.

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,090
And this is called the user illusion and
it is a losery to some degree,

12
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:54,920
but of course it's a very benign
illusion.

13
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:55,850
It's really,
really,

14
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:59,270
uh,
it's a helpful way of organizing a lot

15
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:02,240
of complexity.
We don't need to know all those details.

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,900
We just need to know how to achieve
certain effects.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,680
And basically our brain does the same
thing and has,

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,070
has been doing it for Millennia.
Uh,

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,380
it's got its evolved,
some sort of internal signposts that are

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,260
a good shorthand for things that,
that we can do everywhere we look.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,590
There's things we can do.
We don't know how we do them.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,390
Uh,
we're,

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,270
we're completely cut off from,
from the process.

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,760
If,
if I say,

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,030
um,
uh,

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:36,981
uh,
you know,

27
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,770
give me the first line of limerick
makeup,

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,110
the first line of a limit,
well,

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,350
you know,
give me a few seconds and you'll come up

30
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,820
with two or three.
How'd you do that?

31
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,863
You don't know.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,620
The words just come sort of bubbling up
and you don't have any insight into the

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,740
sort of subterranean unconscious
processes that generates that particular

34
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,320
district.
You may have a little insight,

35
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:59,590
but not much.
And it's,

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,800
there's a very sharp limit to the depth
that we as conscious agents can probe

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,160
our own activities.
And this,

38
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,780
uh,
this,

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,880
uh,
sort of superficial,

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,560
uh,
access that we have to what's going on.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,340
That's what consciousness is.
Now when I say,

42
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,941
well,
who's this?

43
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,100
We,
who's got this access?

44
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,500
That's itself part of the illusion
because there isn't a sort of boss,

45
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,590
uh,
part of the brain that's sitting there,

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,140
uh,
with this limited access that itself is,

47
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,120
uh,
is,

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,820
is part of the illusion,
but it is,

49
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:46,730
is a bunch of different subsystems which
have,

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,530
uh,
varying access,

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,530
the varying things,
and that conspire in a sort of

52
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:56,531
competitive way to,
to execute whatever projects it is that

53
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,310
their,
uh,

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,900
in their sort of mindless way.
