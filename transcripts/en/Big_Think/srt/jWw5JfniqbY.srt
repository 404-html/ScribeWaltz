1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,903
Yeah,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,280
I think one of the great things I love
about San Francisco is so fun.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,100
I just love the typography offer.
It was a great walk into and you just,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,640
you can walk around San Francisco and
suddenly you know,

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,310
you,
you,

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,140
you get up and one of the hills and
you're looking over the city and you're

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,460
just go a completely different aspect.
You couldn't believe that you,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,680
you're,
you're just a marriage,

9
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,080
don't to this.
So when you can just see all over the

10
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,090
place,
you dip down into the,

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,570
into the skin to get Kinda cool
neighborhood you've never seen before

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,800
and it's obviously because of it's
always,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,420
again,
it's changed me.

14
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,670
All American cities are changing because
of maybe,

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,030
maybe San Francisco.
I was going to say that affluence is as

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,030
driven out the ash to San Francisco.
We used to go there and you're used to

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,800
and know the economically disadvantaged.
I used to fly to San Francisco and

18
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:03,360
people used to go there for the vibe and
the whole hippie thing and stuff like

19
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:08,361
that and but I'm not.
It's the recession might kind of

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,890
ironically might restore the glory of
San Francisco and away know and stop

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,450
being this kind of Yuppie Paradise,
which is kind of just become the whole

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,960
silicon.
