1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,580
Britain,
Britain,

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,290
Britain had a real problem in the 1990s
because it basically allowed a number of

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:17,220
radical clerics,
especially for very key crap clerics to

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,520
operate within the country.
Um,

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,890
Abu Hamza,
I was one of them,

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,510
advocate tater and other Omar Bakri
another and these clerics were allow us

7
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,100
to operate,
um,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,130
to give Simon's,
to radicalize youngsters,

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,300
to travel up and down the country,
address thousands of followers and some

10
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,280
of those followers then join up with,
with,

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,310
with al Qaeda became involved in suicide
bombings,

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,250
um,
cause real problems to the British

13
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:49,200
authorities in the period afterwards.
And certainly by either expelling some

14
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:54,201
of them or imprisoning other others of
them that that problem has been reduced.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,540
The radicals now being driven much more
underground in the United Kingdom at

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,620
which,
which poses all sorts of other concerns,

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:06,621
but at least there isn't this a radical
message being put out in the open

18
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,120
anymore,
um,

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,180
in the UK.

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,240
And so that,
that,

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,850
that,
that has changed the,

22
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,740
the,
the climate too to a degree in the

23
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,540
United Kingdom.
Um,

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,260
and you're starting really to see a push
back against the radicals amongst,

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,080
um,
all sorts of constituencies within the

26
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,640
Muslim community.
Um,

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
people who,
who wants,

28
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,940
had some sympathy,
um,

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,863
with,
uh,

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,970
some of archive has goals in the very
least,

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,490
and now going around mosque and they're
saying,

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,140
you know,
don't be any part of this,

33
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,150
this,
this ideology is not Islamic.

34
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,241
And,
and said,

35
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,570
you're seeing people,
um,

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,800
who were once involved with some of
these movements now tony against them

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,620
and I sort of push back happening
against the radicals.

38
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,440
And the key thing there was the July
seven,

39
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,880
2005 alcaide or attack on the London
subway system,

40
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,150
which really woke up a lot of them was
in community,

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,901
um,
in,

42
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,770
in,
in Britain to the threat of alcaide are,

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,950
and turn some people who add at least a
little bit of sympathy with what some of

44
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,570
our Kyler was doing around the world.

45
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,530
And certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan,
a away from the organization.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,740
Uh,
it was a sort of polarizing a event.

47
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,540
Um,
it's,

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,270
it,
it really turned vast majority of

49
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,820
Muslims fully against al Qaeda in the
country.

50
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,020
Um,
but of course,

51
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:25,440
the people who were already radicalized,
some of them became a even more

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,100
fervently radicalized by that event,
energized by that event.

53
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,480
Certainly,
um,

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,580
the,
the four suicide bombers,

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,920
uh,
amongst the small radical fringe of seen

56
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,581
as heroes.
I've,

57
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,140
I've had people come up to me and say,
Mahabir city ECOM is a blessing.

58
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,680
Marta.
Um,

59
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,510
you know,
who's going to go to paradise?

60
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,170
That they see him as an example.
Some of them unfortunately,

61
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,210
might want to follow in his footsteps.
Um,

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,810
but for the vast majority of Muslims,
and even for some wisdom to had some

63
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,230
sympathy for some of Alcaide as goals,
um,

64
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,170
that was an event really made them wake
up and turn against,

65
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,800
um,
the,

66
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,050
the radicals.
Uh,

67
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,870
so July seven was very important,
uh,

68
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,510
in London,
um,

69
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,340
in really,
um,

70
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,090
starting up or off an opposition against
this ideology.

71
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,041
Um,
and,

72
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,874
and,
um,

73
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,440
changing the climate.
