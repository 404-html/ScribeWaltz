1
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,820
It really depends who you are and sort
of what you've done.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,880
I think a lot of people,
um,

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,660
what did they say?
A perfection is the enemy of the good or

4
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:21,150
something like that.
I think a lot of people will put the

5
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,720
stuff off because they want to do the
right thing.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,260
And I think logically the way to
approach your own personal,

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,730
uh,
situation in terms of the environment is

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,240
to take some time to a carbon
calculator,

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,580
figuring out where you have the most
impact,

10
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:39,800
focus on those things first,
et cetera.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,260
I think the,
the challenge with that is that people

12
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:47,261
may put that off and put that off
because it's a big thing.

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,070
They just want to do it right and they
want to be sure.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,230
So I,
I try to counsel people just,

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,080
just get started,
pick something.

16
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,990
It doesn't really matter what,
pick something that matters to you and

17
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,170
that just feels right and just start and
I think that gets you on the path.

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,070
And then,
you know,

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,930
if you want to be more strategic,
great,

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,750
by all means get up,
get on one of those carbon calculators,

21
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,210
figure out where you can have your
impact and sort of do that.

22
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,620
So,
um,

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,720
I think that's,
I've met,

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,990
that's a big one.
I think in terms of general concepts,

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,270
there's a very,
very simple one,

26
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:22,160
just small is sexy and it just apply.
It applies to,

27
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,890
I say in Jasper applies to everything.
Like we just,

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,920
we have this perception that we need a
lot of things or,

29
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,610
or,
or volume or what have you in order to

30
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:36,380
be happy and we've just don't.
So whether it's architecture,

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,320
you know that the houses have gone from
some close to a thousand square feet and

32
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:44,800
like 50 years ago to close to two and a
half,

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,500
literally two and a half times as big
while the fat average family size has

34
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,100
shrunk.

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,170
Oh,
it's not like we are a lot happier now

36
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:55,250
than we were in the 50s.
So you can live a great life and,

37
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:57,110
and um,
in a,

38
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,200
in a much smaller home.
And,

39
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,230
and by doing that,
because the space is much smaller,

40
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:05,810
you save on heating,
you save on cooling,

41
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:09,200
you see save on lighting,
you save on furnishing.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,960
And it just makes for an overall simpler
life.

43
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:15,200
So I think focused on small smells
great.

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,840
And that can be cars,
that can be architecture,

45
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,940
that can be the size of your wardrobe,
that can be the,

46
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,490
your number of,
uh,

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,940
we can John's via plane.
But I think just,

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,990
just focus on that.

49
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,790
I think if we were,
if we were very vocal with both our

50
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:39,954
dollars

51
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,990
in terms of what,
what products and services we're willing

52
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,780
to support and what not,
um,

53
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,810
and in terms of the political process,
I think that that in itself can have a

54
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,940
tremendous impact because it also
impacts the people around you.

55
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,750
So it sort of covers the consumer and
the personal aspect it sends a message

56
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,960
to and sends a message to,
uh,

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,040
to,
to government.

58
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,750
So I think if we were a lot more vocal
and a lot less concerned about what

59
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,584
other people

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,480
thought,
I think that.
