1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,230
Is this question of scientific literacy
in the United States is in fact one of

2
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:11,550
our greatest challenges.
What we scientists would want people to

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,630
understand is a,
our science is not a challenge to their

4
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,350
religion because that's the tension that
we can see rising in our society.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,440
You'll remember earlier I talked about
the fact that we build theories.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,030
We don't build trues as I understand
religions there about truths.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,560
That's a different thing and in fact
it's that wall that actually protects

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,180
religion from science and vice versa.
The fact that they're really about very

9
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,210
different things.
Stephen Jay Gould,

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,280
he used to call them non overlapping
magisterial and I think that's about

11
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,810
right.
Even Galileel makes this comment about

12
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:52,470
the difference two years in which these
two activities reside.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,860
So I think that's of great importance to
us because we know from looking at

14
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:02,430
several thousand years of history that
when religion and science clash,

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,530
science generally loses.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,850
For example,
over 2000 years ago,

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,210
there were two philosophers named
Aristotle,

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,630
aristotle,
knees,

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,980
and I'm [inaudible] who figured out that
the earth was round.

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,850
This belief was in conflict with beliefs
about the Olympian gods.

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,460
And so this scientific fact was lost
until it was rediscovered with,

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,100
because about 1800 years later.
So the religion,

23
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,230
there wasn't our one of our modern
religions,

24
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:43,230
but it was a religion.
And there are other examples.

25
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:47,280
The first person who had the idea that
there might be life on another planet.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,730
It was a priest by the name of Joe,
Donald Bruno.

27
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,870
He paid in part for this with his life.
So science loses when a society sees

28
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,990
science and conflict with religion.
We could do other examples.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,950
So that's one thing.
The other thing that we would want

30
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,951
people to know about is that science is
a process by which we are trying to

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,660
decrease our ignorance.

32
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,830
We want to know more about the universe,
we want to know it more accurately.

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,170
And the ultimate purpose of this knowing
is to increase the store house of human

34
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:29,610
knowledge,
which is ultimately to be used to

35
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
increase the quality of human life.
I think most of us who do science would

36
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,330
not do this if someone said you can
learn all these things,

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
but at the end of the day it's not for
increasing everyone's quality of life.

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,140
So I would personally want a
scientifically literate citizen to

39
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:56,370
understand that your scientists are
people that are really working on behalf

40
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,160
of not perhaps you,
but that would be nice.

41
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,860
Or maybe it's your children or your
grandchildren or your great,

42
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,370
great grandchildren or great,
great,

43
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:03,761
great,
great,

44
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,211
great,
great,

45
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:04,631
great,
great,

46
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,450
great,
great grandchildren that in fact it's a.

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,750
it's a commitment to humanity and then I
guess the final thing that I like for

48
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:18,061
the scientifically literate
citizen to do is to be a lifelong

49
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,584
learner.

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,780
To not disengage because most people
disengaged from science after they leave

51
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,060
university because it's not relevant to
their life.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,980
They're doing something else,
making money,

53
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,640
making a life.
But we're now moving into a period in

54
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,880
the history of our nation
where,

55
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,270
for example,
we have genomic science.

56
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,280
I like to challenge people to say,
look,

57
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,290
suppose you could have a daughter that
played tennis like Venus Williams and

58
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,490
looked like corner Kournikova and played
golf like tiger woods.

59
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,730
Would you choose not to give her that
opportunity?

60
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,230
What were the genomic science?
That may not become a theoretical

61
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,020
question,
so we're going to have to make clever

62
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:06,880
choices as a society about the way we
apply science,

63
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,090
Genomic Science,
Nano Science,

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,990
you know,
I walk around normally hooked up to a

65
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,100
cell phone.
I,

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,490
I see you right now.
You have these plugs in your ears

67
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,270
listening.
A lot of us are really plugged in while

68
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:27,271
imagine that you had a genomic device,
a rather nanoscale device that you could

69
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,200
surgically implant in your brain that
will allow you to directly access the

70
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,110
web.
Would you make that decision?

71
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,150
Well,
you might think that would be really

72
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,490
convenient until you remember there are
hackers out there.

73
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,770
You want people hacking in your brain,
so they're really some great challenges.

74
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,710
Scientists really putting us into the
position of

75
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,970
defining,
redefining what it means to be human,

76
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,190
but if that's going on,
we had better have as broader discussion

77
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:00,310
as possible in our society about what it
is that we want.

78
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,920
This one

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,630
that happened.
If the general public disengaged.
