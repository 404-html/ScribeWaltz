1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,080
Modest.
I think one thing we've learned over the

2
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:12,914
last eight,

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,220
the obvious one is you can't bring
democracy at the barrel of a gun.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,680
I mean I think people would have known
that in the first place that even the

5
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:22,260
Bush people don't say that they,
they,

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,580
that's what they sought to do though.
It's sure it looks like that's what they

7
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:27,760
sought to do.
The point is what can you do?

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,800
What can any outside act or including
the United States do to try to bring

9
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,590
more democratic outcomes in countries?
And I think there's,

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,360
I,
I tend to talk about it as a kind of

11
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:40,630
high thing in a low thing.
The low thing which happens with nobody

12
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:45,550
particularly noticing it is the slow
effort at building up institutions.

13
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,910
The state building part of this,
and,

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,570
and this is a key aspect,
but a,

15
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:55,571
a very gradual listic one where you try
to help countries with issues of rule of

16
00:00:56,111 --> 00:01:00,130
law and transparency and limiting
corruption as well as helping to build

17
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,480
infrastructure and so forth.

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,510
That's the low thing,
the high thing and the dramatic thing.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,180
Well,
these are public diplomatic acts.

20
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,820
So how can the United States make a
difference there?

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,340
Well,
there are some times when elections are

22
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:16,330
enormously consequential and it really
matters a lot for the United States to

23
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,670
come down on the right side.
Uh,

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,570
we saw recently in Pakistan and the
United States was on the wrong side and

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,790
the democratic civilian secular parties
succeeded anyway.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,520
So it shows the limits of our power for
bad as well as for good.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,720
But there are moments when are these
enormously important for the United

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,340
States to say there was a democratic
side and there is a not democratic side,

29
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,330
well,
less democratic.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
And we stand with the devil
to take eight an example,

31
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:52,420
which I think is not the space you hear
people say,

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,100
Oh,
in the Middle East we have a tradition

33
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:56,620
of Islamic democracy.
We call it the shoe off,

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,720
which is to say a council of elders who
together reach a consensual conclusion.

35
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,190
Well,
that's not a democracy.

36
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,650
That does not represent the will of the
people.

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,410
And especially in a complex society,
uh,

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,090
as opposed to a tribal society.
Uh,

39
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,920
sure.
Art will not be a,

40
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,250
a useful reflection of people's will and
will not be sufficiently accountable to

41
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:22,760
them and will not be counterbalanced by
other powers as well.

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,070
So there's an example where I would say
the local customs don't get you there,

43
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:31,610
or the lawyer Jirga in Afghanistan,
they're very important transitional

44
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:33,710
devices,
but they're not the thing itself.

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,530
At the same time,
uh,

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,300
there are lots of elements of things
like how power is divided between the

47
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:44,360
center and the locality,
where the United States has a particular

48
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,390
way of doing it that's very different
from our western other Western

49
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,520
democracies,
much less in other African countries.

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,620
They are systems of,
of adjudicating a more traditional

51
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,431
systems of,
of,

52
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:56,360
of the,
of justice,

53
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,310
for example,
which can waive alongside more western

54
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,690
systems of justice.
So incredibly,

55
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,430
there is not a one size fits all aspect
of democracy,

56
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,431
but it's a big mistake to think that
it's so variable that there are not a

57
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:16,360
series of quite fundamental practices,
values institutions,

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,490
which aren't as essential for anybody.
