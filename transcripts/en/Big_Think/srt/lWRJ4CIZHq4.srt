1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,073
Yeah,

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,110
I like to think of innovation as a
process.

3
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:13,111
It's a process of transforming new ideas
into tangible societal impact and so

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,140
that means that it's not enough to just
have a new idea,

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,640
but it's really important for that idea
to make an impact,

6
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,110
to scale,
to grow,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,640
to touch many peoples' lives.
Certainly it can create financial

8
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:31,270
wealth,
but it also creates social wealth,

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,160
social capital,
human capital,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,800
and so it's really important to look at
it from that whole perspective.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,400
Right now we're in a very challenging
situation and obviously,

12
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:43,930
and everyone's wondering where the next
job's going to come from and absolutely

13
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,930
new jobs are going to have to come from
new businesses and new products and

14
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:51,220
those come from from new ideas,
so if you do incremental innovation,

15
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,670
you might grow,
have a little bit of a economic growth,

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,170
but it's the real fundamental,
groundbreaking ideas that create whole

17
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:00,820
new sectors,
whether it's the internet or

18
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:04,660
biotechnology or now green technology,
a water technology,

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,550
and there's some real needs and
challenges in the world.

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:14,440
Grand challenges that will also only be
solved with some serious innovation.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,750
A lot of people think that economic
downturns time to really buckle down and

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,110
look within and uh,
you know,

23
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:25,360
there's not going to be any
opportunities.

24
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,780
And the reality is that during an
economic downturn,

25
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:32,860
that could be some of the biggest
opportunities for individuals,

26
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,150
entrepreneurs and companies.
In fact,

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,890
the majority of the Dao,
the companies in the Dow,

28
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,800
we're funded or were founded in an
economic downturn,

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,680
a Disney,
Cisco,

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,480
um,
Caterpillar,

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,110
a tons of companies that have really
seized an opportunity.

32
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:55,060
And part of that is because you don't
have a situation where everyone wants to

33
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,060
get into the game.
And,

34
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,180
uh,
everyone says,

35
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,920
oh,
it's my turn to make a buck.

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,050
And A,
they're not really serious about the

37
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,870
passion of their idea.
It's really the best,

38
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,810
uh,
only people that are really resourceful

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,250
and see a real opportunity and jump in
there probably are going to survive.

40
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,940
But it's a real opportunity for those
ideas to flourish.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,330
And it's also,
in some ways it might be more

42
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:23,500
challenging to start a company,
but at the same time it can be easier

43
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,020
because the rents are cheap.
The talents cheap.

44
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,800
You don't have as much competition,
others jumping into the market,

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,860
so there's some positive sides for the
entrepreneur as well.

46
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,510
Universities have historically been a
huge source of innovation for the

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:46,791
country and in fact there was a study
that was done recently a couple of years

48
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,110
ago that looked at the r and d,
100,

49
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:54,111
which is the hundred most significant
innovations of the year as defined by R

50
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:59,320
and d magazine.
And what was interesting,

51
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:04,240
they looked over the last 30 or more
years of historically speaking,

52
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,250
and if you look at about 30 years ago,
a 20 slash 25,

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,670
30 years ago,
about 70 percent of the most significant

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,760
innovations had found their initial idea
in a private in the private sector and

55
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,770
industry had funded it exclusively and
now it's completely flipped.

56
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,771
So 70 percent our fund are founded or
developed using public funding

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,250
universities and a federal labs.
So that's an example of,

58
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,220
or a demonstration of something that
people have been saying for a little

59
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:43,840
while now is that you just don't have
the bell labs and Xerox,

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,940
Xerox Parks and industry to be doing
some of the really fundamental research

61
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:52,630
that's going to be creating the
breakthrough ideas of the next,

62
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,940
um,
of the next generation.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,000
So universities,
um,

64
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,903
they,
they,

65
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,630
they really form a nexus of innovation,
um,

66
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,680
ecosystems and they,
they're the source of the real

67
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:08,200
breakthrough ideas that we're going to
be in eating and innovation.

68
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,340
One thing that I'm very passionate about
and I think is really important for

69
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:20,341
people to understand is every year in
this country we spend taxpayers,

70
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,080
the federal government spends $50,
billion dollars a year on university

71
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,510
research.
And that's absolutely critical because

72
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,780
that's where the,
the new ideas are going to be coming

73
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,820
from and the real breakthroughs.
Uh,

74
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,570
however we spent $50,
million dollars a year on research,

75
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:41,440
but we spend almost nothing on the
programs in universities to get those

76
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,800
ideas out into the market.
Despite that,

77
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:48,550
we still,
there's a study by the Association of

78
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,230
university technology managers,
autumn,

79
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,530
the latest study from 2008.
They do a survey every year show that,

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,520
um,
there've been,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,430
you know,
over 600 new products that are developed

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,500
that were developed that year and almost
600 startups have spun out of

83
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,360
university,
uh,

84
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:12,361
intellectual property and there's about
3,300 university spin outs that are in

85
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,490
business today.
And so it's,

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,240
it's despite the fact that we're not
investing in it,

87
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:23,080
it is happening,
but it's not happening at nearly the

88
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,020
rate.
And I've seen it with my own eyes that

89
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:29,140
there are things that are sitting on the
shelves and sitting in the labs that are

90
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:32,620
not seeing the light of day.
And I believe that it's really in large

91
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,400
part because of the.
There's a big gap between the university

92
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,234
in the market.

93
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Well first you know,
what,

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
what is,
what is that gap?

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,180
And a lot of people talk about something
called the valley of death and it's

96
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,160
primarily seen as a funding gap.
There's some really interesting ideas in

97
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:58,100
the lab,
but just they're a little bit too far

98
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,280
removed from,
from the private sector is willing to

99
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,400
invest in it,
so we need to do a proof of concept to

100
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:09,401
show that these ideas will actually work
for specific market needs to address,

101
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,880
to address specific market needs.
Um,

102
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,750
and so that's,
that's one need.

103
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,960
And uh,
the angel investors,

104
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,930
venture capitalists are not filling that
gap and I'm not sure that it really

105
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,330
isn't appropriate for them to be filling
that gap because these are not ready for

106
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,630
it to be a startup or a product yet.
Um,

107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,860
but it's also a cultural gap.
So in the university,

108
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,051
uh,
the,

109
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:33,980
you know,
the motivations are how do I support my

110
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,470
students and how do I,
um,

111
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,270
how do I get the next research grant,
how do I raise my reputation as the

112
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,440
expert in this field?

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,780
Um,
whereas in the private sector,

114
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,420
of course it's about revenues,
profits and,

115
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,170
and so,
and those are completely appropriate

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,220
motivations for the two groups.
And so in another way I like to think

117
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,590
about it as an academia.
Surprises are good,

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,080
but in industry not so much.
So,

119
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,540
uh,
it was definitely a big cultural gap and

120
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,110
what we're,
what,

121
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,610
what we don't want to do is we don't
want to try to turn academics into

122
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,000
business people and we certainly are not
going to get business people to try to

123
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,280
become academics,
but will we need to do is to help

124
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,420
connect them,
uh,

125
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,450
and help connect the two cultures and
enable them to learn about each other

126
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,340
and what motivates them so that they can
speak each other's language.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,540
And so,
um,

128
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,200
it's,
it's really about the bridging and

129
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,580
about,
about teaching.

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,880
So we've had some,
um,

131
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,870
you know,
across the country have been some

132
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:43,871
success successes with innovation
centers and proof of concept funds and

133
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,450
uh,
a greater focus on tech transfer and on

134
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,750
entrepreneurship education.
And so I have a proposal that I wrote

135
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:58,751
with the support of many others that as
called the impact proposal.

136
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,720
It was at the urging of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy.

137
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,880
They said,
how can we help bridge this gap?

138
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,280
And the idea behind it is a,
to start with a pilot program,

139
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,430
a $20,000,000 pilot program where a
handful of universities would be

140
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:20,741
selected to develop these programs,
innovation programs to provide small

141
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:26,801
proof of concept grants,
50 $100,000 to faculty and students to

142
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:31,160
provide mentoring for the faculty and
the students and,

143
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,680
um,
provide some educational resources and

144
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,490
connections to the outside community and
really build ecosystems around these

145
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,620
centers.
And it's built on,

146
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,720
um,
you know,

147
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,700
it's worked before,
but to help build it into a best

148
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,460
practice that others can build on.

149
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,280
And ultimately,
hopefully the federal government would

150
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,070
see that there is a value,
incredible value that would pay back in

151
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,650
many,
many fold that so would be worth

152
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,490
investing in this process.
The PR and the,

153
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,250
the local capacity around the
university.

154
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:09,251
So the university's would serve as the
nexus of these innovation ecosystems.

155
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,740
And I think that universities are
particularly well suited to serve as

156
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,880
that nexus because not only are
universities creating some of the most

157
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,600
exciting ground breaking technologies
and ideas already.

158
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,130
Um,
but we're also incredibly situated with,

159
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,530
you know,
hundreds of thousands of alumni that

160
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,180
want to get involved.
We have brands,

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,230
local,
uh,

162
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:35,820
interest in the local community and
we're also really good conveners because

163
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,520
a,
we don't have any private interest or

164
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:43,230
any particular bias and um,
and we're also incredibly good at

165
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,470
educating people.
So we,

166
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,710
that's,
that would be,

167
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,480
that's a really powerful role.
And up until now universities have,

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,260
you know,
the main focus of the university is the

169
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,220
creation and dissemination of knowledge.
So this is it.

170
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,210
This is an extension of that already,
you know,

171
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,780
important,
very important mission to the point

172
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,970
where,
how do we disseminate that knowledge to

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,740
make greater societal impact?

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,520
Well,
I'm in the 2008 item survey.

175
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,720
Um,
they were,

176
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,750
they surveyed all the universities and
the assault spinouts that have been

177
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,320
created out of university intellectual
property and uh,

178
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,740
and this does not include,
to be clear either the student startups

179
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:30,741
and other startups that may be created
not based on intellectual property that

180
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,580
um,
the,

181
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,490
uh,
72 percent of startups that spin out of

182
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:40,410
universities stay local within the state
of the university.

183
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,830
So it has a huge economic impact and um,
it also because of that ecosystem

184
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,640
feeling indeed can,
and I've seen it happen when I,

185
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,660
when I was at mit and now that I'm at
USC to have these and promote the ideas

186
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:59,370
that are within the university in a
programmatic fashion.

187
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:03,000
It's a very,
a very successful way,

188
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,580
are very,
very effective way of getting alumni

189
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,500
involved and getting the local business
community involved within the university

190
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,990
and come together and then meet each
other.

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,690
So it snowballs and it just becomes much
more,

192
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,520
becomes a really vibrant community.

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,050
Many people have asked me whether is
this just appropriate for a elite

194
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,540
universities?
And I think that's absolutely not,

195
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,160
uh,
not the case because,

196
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,061
uh,
any,

197
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:35,061
any university either that does research
or has students that are,

198
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,440
have some sort of entrepreneurial
inclination would really be better,

199
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,000
would be well served to be trying to
increase that,

200
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:48,870
that type of inactivity in the case of a
smaller university that might have a

201
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,850
smaller research budget,
uh,

202
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,620
they can,
they can band together to a greater

203
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,230
critical mass.
So for example,

204
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:59,170
if a friend of mine who's heading up
tech transfer at Brandeis University in

205
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:02,350
Boston,
she's working with other universities in

206
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:07,351
that area to create a consortium so that
they can work together and have that,

207
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,070
have a much larger research base to
attract more individuals to that,

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,400
to that group so that there's definitely
opportunities for any university to

209
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,830
participate in this sort of activity.

210
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,310
Um,
the,

211
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,270
the reality is there have been studies
that show that the more

212
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,280
basic and the more groundbreaking the
research,

213
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,850
the more effective tech transfer and
innovation there is from the university.

214
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:41,371
So I would encourage those universities
to not give up the roots of doing some

215
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,940
really basic research because I think
there's a bit of a temptation to say,

216
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,451
oh,
well,

217
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:50,430
we only have a small research base.
Let's try to move as much of it into

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,890
applied research as possible.
And I think that that's absolutely not,

219
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,430
would not be the right approach if
you're really trying to make some

220
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,960
groundbreaking innovations.
