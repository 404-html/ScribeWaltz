1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,690
I think that everyone in the world could
be a math person if they wanted to.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,810
The key word though I want to say is if
they wanted to.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,140
That said,
I do think that everyone in America

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,550
could benefit from having that matt bath
mathematical backgrounds in reasoning

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,950
just to help everyone make very good
decisions.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,060
And here I'm distinguishing already
between math as people usually conceive

7
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:29,440
of it and decision making and analysis,
which is actually what I think math is.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,700
So for example,
I don't think that being a math person

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,910
means that you can recite the formulas
between signs,

10
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,020
co-signs tangents and to use logarithms
and exponentials interchangeably.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,820
That's not necessarily what I think
everyone should try to concentrate to

12
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,370
understand.
The main things to concentrate to

13
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,490
understand are the mathematical
principles of reasoning.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,590
But let me go back to these signs.
Co-Signs and,

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,011
and,
and,

16
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:54,910
and logarithms.

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,630
Well actually if they do have value,
what they are is that they are ways to

18
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:03,631
show you how these basic building blocks
of reasoning can be used to deduce

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,410
surprising things or difficult things.
In some sense.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,060
They're like the historical coverages of
the triumphs of mathematics,

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,100
so one cannot just talk abstractly
about,

22
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:15,521
yes,
let's,

23
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,760
let's talk about mathematical logic.
It's actually quite useful to have case

24
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,500
studies or stories which are,
which are these,

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,310
these famous theorems now I actually
think that these are accessible to

26
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,410
everyone.
I think that actually one reason

27
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:30,370
mathematics is difficult to understand.
It's actually because of that network of

28
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:33,190
prerequisites.
You see math is one of these strange

29
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:38,191
subjects for which the concepts are
chained in sequences of dependencies.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,310
When you have long chains,
there are very few starting points.

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,370
Very few things I need to memorize.
I don't need to memorize,

32
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,950
for example,
all these things in history such as when

33
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:51,010
was the war of 1812 well actually I know
that one because that's a matter of

34
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:51,190
fact.

35
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,000
It was 1812 but I can't tell you a lot
of other facts which are just purely

36
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,150
memorized in mathematics.
You are very few that you memorize and

37
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:02,110
the rest you did use as you go through
and this chain of deductions is actually

38
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,760
what's critical.
Now,

39
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,980
let me contrast that with other
subjects.

40
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,500
Like say history.
History doesn't have this long chain.

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,890
In fact,
if you fully understand the war of 1812

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,820
that's great and it is true that that
will influence perhaps your

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,860
understanding later of the women's
movement.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,420
But it won't be as absolutely
prerequisite in the sense that if you

45
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,030
think about the concepts,
I actually think that history has more

46
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:27,470
concepts than mathematics.
It's just that they're spread out

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,880
broader and they don't depend on each
other as strongly.

48
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,160
So for example,
if you miss a week,

49
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,200
you will miss the understanding of one
unit,

50
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,050
but that won't,
that won't stop you from understanding

51
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:39,550
all of the rest of the components.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,420
So that's actually the difference
between math and other subjects.

53
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,730
In my head,
math has fewer concepts,

54
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,760
but they're chained deeper.
And because of the way that we usually

55
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,650
learn,
when you have deep chains,

56
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,590
it's very fragile because you're gonna
lose anyone link meeting.

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,990
If you miss a few concepts along the
chain,

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,060
you can actually be completely lost.
If,

59
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,640
for example,
you're sick a week or if your mind is

60
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,950
somewhere else for a week,
you might make a hole in your

61
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,280
prerequisites.
And the way that education often works

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,640
where it's almost like riding a train
from a beginning to an end.

63
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,380
Well,
it's such that if you have a whole

64
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,440
summer and your track,
the train is not going to pass that

65
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,710
hole.
Now I think that the way to help to

66
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,910
address this is to provide a way for
everyone to learn at their own pace and

67
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,700
in fact a fill in the holes whenever
they are sensed.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,720
And I actually feel like if everyone was
able to pick up every one of those

69
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,540
prerequisites as necessary,
filling in any gaps they have,

70
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,460
mathematics would change from being the
hardest subject to the easiest subject.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,750
I think everyone's a math person and all
that one has to do is to go through the

72
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,670
chain and fill in all the gaps and
you'll understand it easier,

73
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,700
more better than all the other subjects.
Actually.
