1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,790
We lost about seven years by the Bush
administration dropping the partnership

2
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,991
for new generation of vehicles that was
coming along at the end of the Clinton

3
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:21,000
administration much.
I it under Vice President Gore's

4
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,280
leadership actually,
um,

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,460
and moving to a hydrogen passenger
vehicles,

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,970
hydrogen,
um,

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,060
um,
has its uses as chemical and chemical

8
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:40,680
plants and the like,
it might even someday be a reasonable

9
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,570
fuel for,
uh,

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,350
for putting in fuel cells and vehicles
for something that is centrally fueled,

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,550
like say a fleet of school buses,
but to have a hydrogen distribution

12
00:00:56,251 --> 00:01:01,251
system at neighborhood filling stations
all over the country,

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,880
uh,
with reforming hydrogen,

14
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,760
putting natural gas in each filling
station.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,630
Reformers,
uh,

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,290
storing explosive hydrogen on a pumping,
on and on.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,160
I had approximately said that I thought
that was going to cost hundreds of

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,260
billions of dollars.
And I was talking with a former

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,050
secretary of energy who's a big fan of
hydrogen,

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,490
um,
not long ago.

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,091
And he said,
no,

22
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,470
Jim,
not hundreds of billions,

23
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:29,820
easily,
way over a trillion,

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,260
trillion,
trillion there before you know it,

25
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,280
it adds up.
Um,

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,310
whereas the only infrastructure change
you need to drive a plugin hybrid is an

27
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,220
extension cord,
whether it's new solar companies,

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,440
then film solar,
Nano solar,

29
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,360
solar coming off the collectors coming
off the production line at a square

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,193
meter,
a second.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,720
Um,
new types of wind turbines.

32
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,240
It can be used on individual buildings
and houses,

33
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,910
not necessarily propeller like spinning
turbans,

34
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,740
but other designs,
vertical designs,

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,990
uh,
uh,

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,220
battery improvements,
making quite plausible.

37
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,780
A 40 mile driving on,
uh,

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,370
as a,
as a plugin on overnight electricity

39
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,300
before you need any gasoline.
If you can do that in general motors,

40
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,420
since that's what they're going to be
producing in 2010.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
All right?
That's in model year.

42
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,930
That's just two years and a bit from
now.

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,160
If you can do that,
you,

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,450
uh,
we'll see.

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,450
Well over half the cars in the country
that are plugins driving effectively on

46
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,630
no gasoline,
no liquid fuel,

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,970
because the average car goes just a
little over 30 miles a day.

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,010
And if you have a 40 mile battery
Ballpark,

49
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,250
you're going to be getting a hundred to
120 miles per gallon of gasoline.

50
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,650
Now if you replaced that gasoline with
85% ethanol,

51
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,650
and let's say it's cellulosic ethanol,
so we're not going to add more and more

52
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,180
to the corn crunch and so forth,
uh,

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,250
then you're getting somewhere up in the
range of 500 miles per gallon of

54
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:21,160
gasoline.
And you don't have to preach at people

55
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,160
about not driving suv is if they have an
issue.

56
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,750
Vinny,
that's a plugin hybrid.

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,160
And when it uses liquid fuel is running
on e 85,

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,730
maybe they're only getting 150 to 200
miles a gallon of gasoline.

59
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,770
But for a chevy suburban,
how bad is that?

60
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,270
Uh,
you know,

61
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,910
sometimes people need big cars.
They gotta be able to have them if they

62
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,500
need them.
Uh,

63
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,710
what the problem is not the cars,
it's the fuel and people both from the

64
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,820
national security perspective and from
the global warming perspective or

65
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:56,821
zeroing in more and more on oil as a big
part of the problem.

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,130
I think,
uh,

67
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,900
um,
it's,

68
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,090
uh,
I think it's promising.

69
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,160
Uh,
I it,

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,160
it's not something you can say is,
is here within the next five years,

71
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,690
but,
but you will within five years see

72
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,691
plugin hybrids on production lines.
You'll see increases in production of

73
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,930
alternative liquid fuels.
You'll see most cars coming off the

74
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,110
production lines being flexible fuel
vehicles so they can use ethanol,

75
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,700
ethanol,
renewable,

76
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,170
uh,
butanol,

77
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,320
et cetera.
I think there's some simple things that

78
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:36,760
government mandates are good for.
Flexible fuel vehicles is one,

79
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,350
the change you need is simply a little
bit of different type of material in the

80
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,760
fuel line and some valves and a slight
software reprogramming.

81
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,180
It costs less than a hundred dollars a
car on the production line.

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,300
It's much less of a big deal than seat
belts.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,680
Uh,
Brazil,

84
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:56,590
a few years ago,
I think around 2002 or three,

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,830
just ordered new vehicles shipped to
them or produced domestically to be

86
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,620
flexible fuel vehicles that could use
either ethanol or gasoline in any

87
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,360
mixture.
Uh,

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,800
in two years they went from 5% to 75% of
the new cars being flexible fuel

89
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,830
vehicles.
So something that simple,

90
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,930
I don't see any reason not to mandate.
What is a really bad idea is for the

91
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:23,860
government to mandate a solution to the
fuel issue.

92
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,000
It's tried it twice in the last 30 years
and it's massively botched it both

93
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,070
times.
One is,

94
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,970
it tried to come up,
uh,

95
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,813
with,
uh,

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,440
in the Carter administration,
they tried to come up with a synthetic

97
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,770
fuel operation.
The syn fuels corporation.

98
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:45,120
It was hugely expensive.
It wouldn't have been affordable and

99
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:50,121
less oil and stayed way up close to,
well 70 to $100 a barrel.

100
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,200
Anyway.
So in 1985,

101
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,110
the Sovi the Saudis drop the bottom out
of the,

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,240
the oil market,
I think probably in part to cause

103
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,580
trouble for the Soviets,
which was good because it was the

104
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:04,700
beginning of the end of the Soviet he
economy.

105
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,320
But one of the other problems,
uh,

106
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,250
they,
uh,

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,130
created was they bankrupted the synfuels
corporation,

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,810
uh,
which was understandable.

109
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:16,010
And then we'd been through all this,
this nonsense about the hydrogen family

110
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,300
car,
uh,

111
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,440
for,
uh,

112
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,820
much of the last seven years.
And the Bush administration,

113
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,170
the government does not have a good
record of picking solutions that ought

114
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,300
to stay out of the business of picking
solutions.

115
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,140
What it ought to do is enable
competition.

116
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,280
Flexible fuel vehicles enable
competition between other types of

117
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,260
liquid fuel.
Um,

118
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,590
battery improvements enable competition
between electricity and liquid fuels.

119
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,180
As you can tell,
I genuinely think plugins are going to

120
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:55,181
have a huge impact once people realize
that they can not only go into a

121
00:06:56,721 --> 00:07:01,721
showroom and buy a reasonably priced car
that they can plug into their garage

122
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:06,971
socket drive for much of the day on
effectively penny a mile electricity

123
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,930
because off peak overnight power is
bound a nickel,

124
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,960
a kilowatt hour and much of the country,
five kilowatt hour charge.

125
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,390
So say it's something between one and 2
cents a mile.

126
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,450
Nonetheless,
gasoline now is 10,

127
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,310
12,
14 cents a mile.

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,000
So you're driving,
it's something close to one 10th the

129
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,690
cost that you're usually driving that,
that makes a big difference in some

130
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,610
people's,
uh,

131
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,970
uh,
budgets.

132
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,480
And the other thing is that there's a
concept called V two g or vehicle to

133
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,500
grid,
which after you charged your plugin

134
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,690
hybrid,
let's say you get a charge by midnight

135
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,320
and I have a timer on it,
you can make it available to the utility

136
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,160
from midnight to 6:00 AM when,
let's say you leave for work,

137
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,230
for stabilization of the grid and for
what's called spinning reserves.

138
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:02,231
That is a power outages.
Those two together are only about 5% of

139
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:08,051
what utilities need to buy about.
Been about $12 billion a year worth of

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,650
fossil fuels,
mainly natural gas because natural gas

141
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:17,420
tends to be what is turned on and off
quickly since it's amenable to that.

142
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,190
Well,
you know,

143
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,700
that amount of money if it's divided up
fairly between the utilities and the,

144
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,730
uh,
and the,

145
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,130
the consumers,
uh,

146
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,350
there's a,
uh,

147
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:32,630
a professor at the University of,
uh,

148
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,500
uh,
Delaware Kimpton who is writing articles

149
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,180
about this and saying,
you know,

150
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,110
you realize that could be something up
in the range of $2,000 a year for the

151
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,350
owner of a plugin hybrid.
Now let's think about this a minute.

152
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,530
Not only am I driving it a 10th the
cost,

153
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,100
but somebody is paying me close to $200
a month.

154
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,060
Heck,
that's a major share of my car payment

155
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,520
just to leave my car plugged in
overnight.

156
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,560
Hey,
where's that dealer's showroom?

157
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,500
You know,
so,

158
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,510
um,
I think once and different than

159
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,900
utilities or,
or interested in this and to different

160
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,300
degrees,
but in California,

161
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,160
if you'd talked to pg and e for example,
they are really enthusiastic about this,

162
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,510
uh,
concept.

163
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,510
So there could be a substantial interest
in a lot of people,

164
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,230
uh,
in,

165
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,600
uh,
in moving toward plugin hybrids when sir

166
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,630
available.
There is no doubt Toyota has led the way

167
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,470
with the Prius,
but General Motors did a very important

168
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:39,471
thing back in early January when they
announced to the production of the volt,

169
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,150
their plugin hybrid.
And then a few weeks ago on National

170
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,880
Public Radio,
I'm Bob Lutz,

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,180
a very senior,
he's vice chairman of the board and I'm

172
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,550
a man,
very much identified with large cars and

173
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,350
fast cars.
Uh,

174
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,400
he announced they're going to be in
production on plugin hybrids in 2010.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,990
And,
uh,

176
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,090
you know,
you'd have thought to from what he was

177
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,450
saying about oil that he was president
of the Sierra Club.

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,730
Uh,
it was just from my point of view.

179
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,170
Great.
Um,

180
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,230
what's interesting is that Toyota got it
early and I think gm has gotten it now,

181
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,090
which is that for Americans they don't,
and they shouldn't have any particular

182
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:27,150
problem with the cars.

183
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,140
I mean,
look,

184
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I had three little boys at a stage in my
life where I was driving eight,

185
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,010
nine kids around to soccer practice and
boy scouts and so forth.

186
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:42,480
I needed my chevy suburban people ought
to be able to have the cars they want.

187
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,520
The problem's not the cars,
it's the fuel.

188
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,510
And so as long as what you're doing is
trying to persuade Detroit to increase

189
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:55,920
the cafe standards a mile or two or
three or four or five or whatever per

190
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,010
gallon,
what they're tying to do is ring more

191
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:03,090
mileage by redesigning the car sometimes
and relatively cheap,

192
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:06,720
sometimes in a little bit more expensive
ways to wring that out.

193
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,250
But if you say,
uh,

194
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,700
and,
and they lobby against it,

195
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:15,990
and they probably could have been
ordered to do it much faster than

196
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,480
they've done it,
but from their point of view,

197
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,310
consumers wanted big,
fast cars.

198
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,060
So all the,
we've had a huge amount of improvement

199
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:24,360
in,
in technology and vehicles in the last

200
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:28,170
20 years.
Virtually all of it has gone in to speed

201
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,670
and horsepower,
not into,

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,410
into fuel efficiency.
