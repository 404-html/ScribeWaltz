1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,490
There are four fundamental forces of
nature as we now understand it,

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,710
there's gravity and electromagnetism,
which are the classic forces which were

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,490
known already in prehistory and uh,
and known in some form to the ancient

4
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,440
Greeks,
but which had mature theories in the

5
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,620
case of gravity already in the 17th
century with Newton,

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,270
end of the 19th century with Maxwell and
very beautiful descriptions in and in

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,790
case of gravity made even more beautiful
with Einstein's general theory of

8
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,791
relativity in the early 20th century,
but in the course of studying a

9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,880
subatomic physics and in what goes on at
a very,

10
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:53,780
very short distances,
people found they needed to additional

11
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,930
forces like gravity and electromagnetism
aren't enough,

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,470
and the two additional forces are called
the strong and weak forces.

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,330
What I got the Nobel prize for was
figuring out the equations of the strong

14
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,830
force and equally important,
not just guessing the equations,

15
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,260
but showing how you could test them and
see that they were right.

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,870
This was something I did as a graduate
student.

17
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,910
I was of course working very closely
with my thesis advisor at very,

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,660
very gifted and a powerful physicist
named David.

19
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,490
Gross,
uh,

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,630
what,
so how did we go about doing it?

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,050
Well,
uh,

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,550
there were some,
there were the experimental situation

23
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:37,430
regarding the strong interaction was
very confused,

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,720
desperately confused.
There was no theory even remotely worthy

25
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:46,040
of standing behind beside Newton's
theory of gravity or Einstein's or

26
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,370
maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.
They were just a lot of rules of thumb

27
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:54,371
and a lot of confusing data.
What we did was focus on one particular

28
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:03,020
phenomena and try to understand just
that

29
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,670
putting off all other aspects of this
confusing a situation.

30
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,350
The phenomena we tried to understand
seems so paradoxical,

31
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:20,351
so crazy that we thought if we could
understand that we could understand

32
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:22,890
anything,
uh,

33
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,280
basically,
uh,

34
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,770
and uh,
and also seen because it seems so

35
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,240
profound and fundamental.

36
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,240
Uh,
actually David thought that we could

37
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:35,060
prove that it couldn't,
that you couldn't just couldn't

38
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,990
understand that within the standard
framework of quantum mechanics and

39
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,390
relativity.
And that would be a very important

40
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:45,590
result too because we'd tell a physicist
they had to go back to the drawing

41
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,490
board.
This aspect that we were trying to

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,640
explain was the fact that
corks,

43
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,670
which were somewhat speculative,
but a pretty clear indication of reality

44
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,820
at that time when they get close
together,

45
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,210
hardly interact at all or when they're
moving at very high velocity relative to

46
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,890
one of them there at high energy.
Again,

47
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:16,891
they don't interact very much at all,
but if you try to pull them apart,

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,800
a significant distance,
which means in this case,

49
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,340
10 to the minus 13 centimeters or more,
uh,

50
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,750
or if they're moving slowly,
uh,

51
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,450
then they,
uh,

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,300
have very,
very powerful forces.

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,620
In fact,
you can't extract single corks from

54
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,500
matter.
They always exist bound to one another

55
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:43,501
inside protons and neutrons.
So we needed a force which gets weaker

56
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,880
at short distances and grows as the
distance growth.

57
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:53,881
That's a very paradoxical and difficult
thing to imagine and make consistent

58
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,130
with the other laws of physics that we
know,

59
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,930
uh,
now there were powerful mathematical

60
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,910
techniques.
We're investigating that kind of

61
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,911
question that had been developed in
other for other purposes called

62
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,090
renormalization group.
So we were able to bring those

63
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,580
techniques to bear and address this
question.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,240
And they were very difficult
calculations,

65
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,000
uh,
it wasn't entirely clear that they were

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,720
concise,
consistent that you could actually do

67
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:30,490
this kind of calculation in the kind of
theory that there was most beautiful

68
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,100
that we wanted to investigate.
Uh,

69
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,310
but we insisted on hoping that the most
beautiful equations would be the right

70
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,534
equations.

71
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,990
And we found out that a very,
very special class of theoretical,

72
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,050
uh,
constructions with tremendous amounts of

73
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:58,051
symmetry a could give you this behavior.
So that was,

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
that was,
I like to say that I compare that to a

75
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,060
archimedes saying that if you give me a
lever and a place to stand,

76
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,070
I can lift the world based on that kind
of a

77
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,880
leverage given by the sort of basic
principles and faith in symmetry and

78
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,490
beauty.
Plus this one fact about the force is

79
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,940
getting weaker.
We will lead to quite a unique proposal

80
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,760
for what the equations of the strong
interaction should be.

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,750
And we could develop some consequences
of those equations and then propose to

82
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:42,100
experimenters that they go out and check
whether these consequences are correct.

83
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Now it took several years afterwards
before it became clear that those

84
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:53,110
consequences we predicted were correct,
but they are,

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,470
and in subsequent years that's become
more and more clear.

86
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,920
The theory has been used for a wide
variety of applications now with great

87
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:05,570
success and the kind of thing that in
the early days was called testing

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,890
quantum chromo dynamics or testing
asymptotic freedom is now cold

89
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,850
calculating backgrounds.
So it's gone from being a glamorous

90
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,650
exploration of new worlds to kind of
taking care of the garbage so that you

91
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,484
could,
uh,

92
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,560
you can look for more interesting
things.

93
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,380
But,
uh,

94
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,530
it's,
well,

95
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,930
although it sounds in a way,
it's kind of a,

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,630
a step down in a few if I,
you know,

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,910
look at it in the big picture.
It's glorious that you have a theory

98
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:39,620
that was originally very speculative and
just something that existed in our

99
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,200
minds,
you know,

100
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,260
and we had.
And it's gone now too.

101
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,760
Being an absolutely accepted and basic
part of our understanding of nature and

102
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,630
a very beautiful.
