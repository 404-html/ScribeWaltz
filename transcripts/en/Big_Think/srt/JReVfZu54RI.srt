1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,860
The piracy paradox is a paradox related
to a fashion design.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,250
Uh,
maybe related to other things,

3
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:11,084
but,
uh,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,660
mostly related to fashion design.
The paradox arises from the following,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,310
uh,
kind of puzzle,

6
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:19,430
which is we usually think of
intellectual property protection,

7
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,810
copyright,
for example,

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,460
as a necessary element for creative
production.

9
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,470
So writers won't,
right?

10
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:31,000
If they think there are books are just
going to be copied and musicians won't

11
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,070
create music if they think their works
or just could be stolen.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,930
And so that's why Paris is such a
problem.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,980
What's interesting about fashion design
is you see a lot of creativity in the

14
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,250
fashion world and yet there's no
protection for fashion designs.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,810
So dress appears in the runway on the
Oscars and the next day,

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,560
two days later,
you can buy a cheap version of that from

17
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:55,190
a company like aps.
And so the privacy paradox is looks at

18
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,190
this puzzle and,
and,

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,300
and the idea is that unlike other
industries in which piracy seems to

20
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:05,360
drive out creativity in fashion,
it doesn't drive it out.

21
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:08,240
And in fact,
it seems to accelerate it.

22
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,050
And the reason is that copying of the
copying of designs as it spreads out

23
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:17,780
into the marketplace makes the original
buyer,

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,090
they were the early adopter of a
particular design,

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,210
want to then move on to something new,
right?

26
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:26,470
So fashion's always cycling.
And so one way to think about it is that

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,590
it accelerates the fashion cycle.
So it's paradoxical,

28
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,424
he helpful.

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,050
Couple of implications.
One is

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
that we probably,
that our understanding of what

31
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,690
creativity requires,
which is very instrumental,

32
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,500
one in the US legal system needs to be a
little more nuanced.

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
And so when we think of it as a public
policy question,

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,260
to what degree should government provide
these monopoly rights,

35
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,930
which is what copyrights and patents and
trademarks are.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,290
Uh,
we need to think about how different

37
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,120
industries,
we need to be a little more industry

38
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:06,910
specific.
So rather than a blanket set of rules,

39
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,430
we want to,
we want to understand how these

40
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:13,450
industries work and what kinds of
inducements they need.

41
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,390
So right now there's a bill before
Congress to give fashion designers,

42
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,850
uh,
a kind of copyright.

43
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,200
And that's probably not necessary,
right?

44
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,940
So,
and there may be other cases in which

45
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,810
it's not necessary.

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,750
I think generally

47
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,900
very aggressive about intellectual
property in the U s we're quiet,

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,390
uh,
were quite eager to make sure that other

49
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,400
countries protect our intellectual
property.

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,830
And I think generally that's been
helpful to us.

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,570
Uh,
we are the major producer of movies or a

52
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:49,170
major producer of movies,
um,

53
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,590
lots of other entertainment industries,
software,

54
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,424
et cetera.
So,

55
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,880
so intellectual property is essential to
the American economy of the 21st

56
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,800
century.
And so we've been,

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,620
um,
understandably aggressive about

58
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,860
protecting it in that I think has been
good for our economy.

59
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,290
But it's not just an economic question,
right?

60
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:10,291
So one of the things that we ought to
think about when we're thinking about

61
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,890
how much protection should be given is
what should be in the public domain.

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,090
What,
what is,

63
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,640
um,
what should be allowed us fair use,

64
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,870
uh,
how much,

65
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,750
how long should the protection b and
there,

66
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,320
I think there's a fair question to be
asked about whether we have overshot

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,410
what is reasonable.
And so it's very difficult,

68
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,870
for example,
uh,

69
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,980
for musicians to sample other songs.
I'm more than,

70
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,710
you know,
tiny little snippets because the law has

71
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,190
made it extremely complex and cumbersome
and costly.

72
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
And so many people argue that we've kind
of gone well beyond what's reasonable

73
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,290
and made the public domain the domain of
things that we can all use and remix and

74
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,030
we create,
um,

75
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,690
really inaccessible in a way that's
probably not optimal.

76
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,133
Okay.

77
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,940
And he'd done a couple of things to get
around that.

78
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,630
One is in the World Trade Organization,
which countries like China are eager to

79
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:11,400
be a part of and they are in fact a
member.

80
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,700
We've made an electrical property part
of that agreement.

81
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:19,701
So a part of that organization.
So we have a set of Ip rules that every

82
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:23,790
member state of the WTO has to,
has to accept.

83
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,080
And that linkage between trade and Ip
has been very effective.

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,810
We do that in our bilateral trade
agreements as well.

85
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,660
We go and we say,
you want to trade agreement with us,

86
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:36,720
Peru or Columbia or whatever,
Australia,

87
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,270
great.
But you have to accept a set of

88
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,520
intellectual property rules and you have
to enforce them.

89
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,080
So,
um,

90
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,200
so we've used leverage against these
countries and,

91
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,130
um,
you know,

92
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:48,720
it's not perfect.
So China is still,

93
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,870
you can travel in Asia.
I was in Vietnam a few years ago and

94
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,120
pirated dvds are everywhere,
right?

95
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,830
So it's not,
it's not perfect.

96
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,590
Um,
but we've been cracking down,

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,050
uh,
in a way that we hadn't in the past.

98
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,790
And I think that has slowly moved to
these countries closer to our preferred

99
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,624
position.

100
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,570
It's had an enormous effect on piracy in
that anything that's digital is so music

101
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,120
downloading,
anything that's digital is incredibly

102
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,650
easy to copy.
And therefore,

103
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,640
uh,
the,

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,370
the piracy that goes on as is rampant.
So,

105
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,290
you know,
25 years ago you wanted to copy our

106
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,840
record,
you had a cassette tape,

107
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,630
it was complicated.
Now it's a click and you're done.

108
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,440
So technology has had an enormous effect
and that's what has driven a lot of the

109
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:41,390
concern within the u s over increasing
Ip protection and making sure that other

110
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:44,690
countries in the global marketplace have
the same sets of rules.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Um,
has technology been effective in

112
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:50,570
fighting it?
I suppose so,

113
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,060
but I'm not,
I can't say I can think of an example.

114
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,110
I think it's primarily been,
um,

115
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,270
uh,
you know,

116
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,810
been something that's made the piracy
problem larger.

117
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,130
On the other hand,
I think it's led to a certain kinds of

118
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,860
innovation and industry.
So when the VCR came out,

119
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,350
uh,
companies were very concerned.

120
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:12,170
It's going to be the end of the
television industry,

121
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,700
not the case at all.
Right?

122
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,310
So it ended up creating a whole new
industry.

123
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,660
Um,
you know,

124
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,990
itunes is now this enormous company,
uh,

125
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,690
or enormous enterprise from apple that
didn't exist.

126
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:27,290
So,
so change brings opportunity in every

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,410
economic domain.
And I think Ip is no different.

128
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:31,820
Again,
the question is how much,

129
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,510
how do you balance the incumbent
industries against these,

130
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,030
these unknown future things that we
can't,

131
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,650
we can't know or predict.
