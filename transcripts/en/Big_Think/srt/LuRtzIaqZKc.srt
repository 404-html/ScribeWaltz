1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,330
The,
the brand idea is that the brand is

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,910
going to sum up all of your experience
with the product.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,780
So it's not just the logo,
but the logo is part of it.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,330
Um,
I think it might be be helpful for me to

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,290
back up and say,
you know,

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,830
the way I look at habits forming,
there's this concept of what I say

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,990
contacts q training,
reinforcement.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,170
So the context is that within a specific
environment,

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,310
this is how I'm doing a particular thing
and that context is really important.

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,210
So,
you know,

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,450
if you think about the context of music,
so in the morning you may wake up to um,

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,010
you know,
a radio playing music,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,450
your local radio station,
you may then go to an Ipod,

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,550
you know,
uh,

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,260
in your head when you go for your run in
the morning,

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,030
you get in a car,
you may listen to satellite radio,

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,460
you may listen to,
you know,

18
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,110
again,
you may listen to talk radio on the way

19
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,220
and you may listen to traffic.

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,190
Each of those things.
It's about music,

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,940
but the context changes how you're going
to access it.

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,510
And so this is the thing that within a
context you want to be able to help your

23
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,810
customers simplify their decisions and
it's all about making good,

24
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:14,040
simple decisions.
So for a brand to serve that role,

25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:19,041
then you have to really identify how the
brand allows you to automate a decision.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,030
How,
if I just,

27
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,781
you know,
okay,

28
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm going to buy,
you know,

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,760
Campbell soup to have in the,
in my pantry,

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,090
because there are times when you know
that's going to solve that problem.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,730
I'm wondering fix lunch for the kids.
I don't want to just fix them a cold

32
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,511
sandwich.
Hey,

33
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,210
hot soup.
So I feel like I'm a good parent because

34
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:38,370
I mean,
so there may be a lot of complexity,

35
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,290
there might be a lot of stuff involved
in it,

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,420
but it all gets summarized and that
Campbell's brand and that color and

37
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,050
everything else.

38
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,160
And that's why it can be so powerful.
And so for a brand you know,

39
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,580
that you knew,
you can see why,

40
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,880
what the challenges because there's no
history there.

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,090
So you've got a lot of work to do and
you're advertising and in and getting

42
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:03,120
people aware and then getting people to
understand when they should use you.

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,160
Um,
you think about how many websites there

44
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,200
are,
you think about how many news sources

45
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:08,190
there are.
I mean,

46
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,500
how do I get somebody to come to my
website?

47
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,430
And the key here is I've got to make a
behavior.

48
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:19,050
I've got to do something repeatedly
before my brain can kind of lay down the

49
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:24,051
tracks that automate that process.
And it's that idea of focusing on

50
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,070
behavior versus attitude,
which is so fundamental in terms of our

51
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:33,630
understanding of how the brain works.
So we're before advertisers and

52
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,130
marketers were really,
really focused on trying to get you to

53
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:41,040
have a particular belief or a particular
attitude.

54
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,610
What my contention is,
it's much more important that I get to

55
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,840
behavior because when you talk about the
idea that customer satisfaction doesn't

56
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,040
predict behavior,
well,

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,620
85 percent of people who leave a one
product for another report being

58
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,240
satisfied with the ones that are
leaving.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,810
So,
you know,

60
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,150
if I'm satisfying them,
then why do I measure it?

61
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:04,960
Why do I care?
And it seems kind of unfair.

62
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,250
Wait a second.
I did a great job.

63
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,990
I satisfied them.
Why aren't they staying?

64
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,070
But the reality is that that for
customers that,

65
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,190
you know,
satisfaction doesn't really isn't,

66
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,140
is a conscious concept and a lot of our
decision making is unconscious.

67
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,320
So a great example of this is the way
people watch television now.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,110
We used to get TV guide.
Yeah.

69
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,830
We used to like plan out what we're
going to watch and then plan our time to

70
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:34,510
be in front of a television and now what
a lot of people do.

71
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,220
I mean,
and the numbers are really staggering.

72
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,100
It's really surprising is they,
is they have no idea what they're going

73
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,330
to watch.
They sit down,

74
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,050
they pick up the remote and the remote
now has these digital guides and they

75
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:48,520
flip through and they look what's on and
so it's a total different.

76
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,890
Now,
at no point did someone go,

77
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,530
well,
consciously I've decided that I no

78
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,190
longer want to orient myself around the
television schedule.

79
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,300
When I get in front of the TV,
I'll look to see what's on the point

80
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:04,900
here is that's the way we learn a large
part of is this unconscious learning

81
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:08,650
that we do from these complex feedback
mechanisms that we get from the

82
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:13,300
environment,
and so often companies fail miserably to

83
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,780
really understand how people are making
these decisions.
