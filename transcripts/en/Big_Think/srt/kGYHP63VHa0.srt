1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,270
I agree with the premise of the question
because the rate of change is just so

2
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:16,700
fast,
whether it's through globalization or

3
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:21,260
technology that you know,
if it were ever true that you could do

4
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:24,560
sort of a five year plan and then just
put it aside and executed.

5
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,050
It's certainly not true today.
Uh,

6
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,880
and there is a constant need to
innovate.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,350
And one of the ways that we've benefited
is we do a lot of our business

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,920
development,
um,

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,490
in partnership structures,
uh,

10
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:42,491
whether that's in the US or globally.
And that allows us to kind of go to

11
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:43,940
school,
if you will,

12
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:46,820
on what other organizations are also
doing.

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,310
So for example,
take the mobile sector.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,920
You know,
if you only looked at the u s market

15
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,600
where frankly our,
you know,

16
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:57,950
cell phones and our networks are so far
behind,

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,770
uh,
what it's possible to do with,

18
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,680
you know,
mobile devices in Europe or in Asia,

19
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,380
that you wouldn't even see the
possibilities.

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,010
But because we're a global company,
we were able to see six years ago the

21
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:17,531
potential for those devices being
entertainment devices as well as,

22
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:21,110
you know,
email and phone devices.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,140
And began striking deals with companies
overseas to test different kinds of

24
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:30,800
content,
whether it was games or video.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,160
So I think looking outside of your own
organization and working with your

26
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:39,920
partners,
even vendors can be an interesting

27
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,590
source of innovative ideas.
