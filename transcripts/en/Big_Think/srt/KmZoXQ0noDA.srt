1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,230
Well,
you are,

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:09,231
no women had no rights
when Taliban came to Afghanistan.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,010
What you don't know is Afghan women had
their rights before European women even

4
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,640
knew,
but that was in American woman even knew

5
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,860
that,
uh,

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,860
a very sophisticated country,
uh,

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
in that sense that women were working
shoulder to shoulder with men and women,

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,910
their work,
nightclubs,

9
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,660
women,
no,

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,170
there's picture I've seen a my mom and
her friends wearing high boots,

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,330
mini skirts,
dancing,

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,770
you know,
going to work with the beautiful suits,

13
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,040
you know,
above the knee skirt,

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,000
high heels.
The country went like 500 years

15
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,700
backwards.
That's the part that was really

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,360
extremely upsetting for African women
because if you never seen independence

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,530
and freedom and you'd,
it doesn't hit you so hard if somebody

18
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:12,300
surprises you a little bit further.
But if you had complete freedom and it's

19
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:17,220
come in and it's all taken from you,
it is a shock that it's extremely

20
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,500
difficult to absorb.
And,

21
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,920
uh,
but it was beyond that for me when I

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,930
looked at my country at that time,

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,520
we should
ask about how Judas,

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,890
but children want
it can make an Amazon mean jail

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,730
hall that I watch band wonder.
I'm a probably van neise churches bottom

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,790
fishing amita before me.
Then they came back.

27
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,510
Matt [inaudible],
Matt cautious.

28
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,130
Well,
oh no,

29
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,840
no.
Edie formula this,

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,090
oh,
as I know by the hundred machine and

31
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,650
Macarthur O'connor and John Button
check,

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,493
give a Holler,

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,700
uh,
today,

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,150
uh,
slowly and slowly and Afghanistan,

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,800
I mean,
in Cabo I should say.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,140
And this suburbs is still very
difficult,

37
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:27,141
but in Cabo it's changing a little bit,
but once you go to a shock like that,

38
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,014
a lot of,
um,

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,870
uh,
media asked me a lot about,

40
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,310
you know,
well,

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,830
are you working on getting the burgers
off their women?

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,040
And
my answer to that is the last thing that

43
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,740
an Afghan woman is thinking about right
now is the,

44
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:47,010
she have a burqa on or off.
She's worried about her life,

45
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,650
about her safety,
about her family's safety.

46
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,090
She's poverty is in the highest level
right now.

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,270
She just cares about building a fire,
making some rice and feeding her family.

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,160
Uh,
the priority of having her Burka offer

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,790
on is not on top of her agenda.
Uh,

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,300
what we need to do for women in
Afghanistan is education,

51
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,380
education,
education,

52
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,840
so they can stand up for themselves.

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,630
And when I'm in Afghanistan,
I,

54
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,240
I've never worn a burka.
My mother never worn a burka,

55
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,850
neither my grandmother.
So it's not something I've ever seen

56
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,940
before.
I shot the movie,

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,590
I made a statement about it.
I just refuse to dress like that.

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,810
A,
I want it to be one person has to start,

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,990
you know,
be the example of saying it's okay,

60
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,861
you know,
oh,

61
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,790
look at me.
Okay.

62
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,010
So I have,
I have a little scarf sometimes was on,

63
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,010
sometimes was off.
I wasn't so paying attention to it,

64
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,300
covering my face and all that all the
time.

65
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,090
And um,
yes,

66
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,260
I got some looks,
but I

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,440
didn't care about it.
I just said,

68
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,370
you know,
deal with it.

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,810
I'm not going to do it.

70
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,380
May 2nd.
Oh,

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,920
what was the school?
It's yes to make

72
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,960
nay nay.
I'm okay.

73
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,620
I could put pushing music.
Mama

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,120
