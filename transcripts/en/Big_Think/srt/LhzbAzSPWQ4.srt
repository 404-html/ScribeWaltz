1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,950
Why superiors is,
it's funny,

2
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:13,640
it's,
it's a little like the waves of grief.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,760
I think you have waves of awareness.
Um,

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,340
and one of the things that I found with
grief was actually I was well,

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,900
well prepared for it by the cyclicity of
my manic depressive illness and because

6
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,960
I was used to things coming and going,
um,

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,730
and so forth.
So I think that my awareness of having a

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,810
bipolar is really,
you know,

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,680
have 17,
I got very,

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,280
very depressed and I was like
[inaudible] I didn't have any energy and

11
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:46,010
it was totally,
I just,

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,430
but I didn't have the words.
People didn't talk about it at that

13
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:51,210
time.
And people that certainly didn't have

14
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,490
the words bipolar Ellis or manic
depressive poles.

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,020
So I just was terrified.
Um,

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:02,050
I had no idea what had happened to me
and I was very frightened and I was

17
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,260
frightened it would come back.

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,310
But I got well and then I did what
everybody or most people do when they

19
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,890
get well.
I sort of put it behind me again and

20
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:11,750
then it would come and hit me again and
again.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,620
And so I knew there was something wrong.
Um,

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,160
I started to see a psychiatrist,
tried to see a psychiatrist when I was

23
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:24,161
in college and I ended up just running
away and I couldn't tolerate the idea of

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,370
doing that.
Um,

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,910
but then when I was,
I actually got my degree and I,

26
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,720
I joined the medical school faculty at
Ucla.

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,230
I became raving Lee Manic and very
psychotic and hallucinating,

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,660
delusional.
I didn't have any choice.

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,120
And it was the gray.
It's the great advantage of having an

30
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:49,070
illness as severe as mine is that you
are automatically brought into the

31
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:53,480
medical care system if you have until as
long as it was milder,

32
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,510
I could kind of get by with actually
having to face what was the severity of

33
00:01:59,031 --> 00:01:59,864
my problem.

34
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,900
And I,
I knew the person I wanted to see.

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,850
It was somebody I had trained with.
He was my clinical supervisor and I had

36
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:11,480
seen him with patients and I had seen
that he was tough and smart and

37
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,410
compassionate and humanists,
but also new science and in medicine.

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,980
And so I went to him terrified and he
was just absolutely ferman his

39
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,940
diagnosis.
He just never wavered.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,420
Um,
and he just said that's the way it is.

41
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:30,410
But he was kind about it,
but he didn't back off from it.

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,520
And he was a great psychotherapist.
And so one of the things I've tried to

43
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,440
do in my professional life,
like a lot of my colleagues,

44
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,000
is to emphasize,
you know,

45
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:42,320
medications just aren't enough for many
people who have these illnesses because

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,460
exactly what you're saying is how do you
become aware of an illness?

47
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,670
You become aware of an illness by
understanding yourself and understanding

48
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:57,590
the meaning that that illness has in
your own life symbolically and more

49
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,880
importantly,
quite literally.

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,040
I've primarily been in the psychotic
when manic,

51
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,200
uh,
which is not uncommon with mania.

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,090
And,
um,

53
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,390
it's been mostly when I've been manic,
it's been a very exhilarating sort of

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,210
thing,
including the hallucinations.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Um,
I went around the solar system,

56
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,920
I went to Saturn.
I,

57
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,680
in my mind's eye,
I went through the star fields.

58
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,060
It was,
it was a glorious,

59
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,660
are ecstatic experience,
which is frequently the case with mania.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,370
When you think about a lot of the great
religious ecstasies is a very manic

61
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,380
quality to that and a very grandiose and
they tend to be very universal,

62
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:46,130
cosmic related to everything's related
to everything.

63
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,370
Um,
but I also had some very bad ones.

64
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,213
I've,
you know,

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,280
I'm hallucinating myself is dead or as
I'm just covered with blood,

66
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,980
I mean mania is,
can be as terrifying as it gets.

67
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,130
It is certainly as insane as one gas.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,190
And so it's,
it's frightening when it gets out of

69
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:09,910
control,
but there are periods of mania where it

70
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,230
can be extremely attractive.
Unfortunately,

71
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:17,231
probably true
in depression.

72
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,910
Your capacities you feel just flattens
and disappears and what you feel is

73
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,820
pain.
Um,

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
and,
and it kind of paint that you can't

75
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,140
describe to anybody.
So he is,

76
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,960
so it's an isolating pain.
I can put the isolating pain.

77
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,950
Um,
it's for people with bipolar roles in

78
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,360
particular.
Um,

79
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,340
it is a,
a deadening,

80
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,790
um,
lethargy in a coupled with an agitation

81
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:48,750
and restlessness at times,
but it's a sense of having no energy,

82
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,580
no interest on no passion in their life.
And so for me,

83
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:56,090
like everybody else who gets to really
depressing,

84
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,590
you know,
there comes a point when you say,

85
00:04:58,591 --> 00:04:59,160
okay,
if I,

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,890
if I can't feel,
if I can't care,

87
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:03,630
if I can't think,
I can't concentrate,

88
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:04,470
I can't remember.

89
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,870
I can't read.
Um,

90
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,620
if I can't love,
where am I?

91
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,710
Who is in there?
Where's the humanity?

92
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,530
It's gone.
And,

93
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,000
um,
the pain is agonal adjust is

94
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,040
unrelenting.
In my case,

95
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,910
I had stopped my medicine,
my looked at him and I gotten a wildly

96
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,500
manic and then I got paralytics be
depressed for 18 months and there was

97
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:34,950
not a time during those 18 months,
I can remember feeling okay.

98
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,760
And at some point I tried to kill
myself.

99
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,870
And I think again,
it's very hard to describe the kind of

100
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,600
pain that goes on in severe depression
because it's just,

101
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,750
the words are not there.
