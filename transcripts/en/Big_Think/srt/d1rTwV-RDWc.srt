1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,910
But monetary policy,
that's,

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,050
that's a very good question.
Um,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,100
I think that what the Fed has done so
far,

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:21,130
which is to provide investment banks and
other financial institutions which have

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,050
played an important role in the economy
and an important role in the functioning

6
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:35,471
of the whole credit system,
providing them with access to liquidity

7
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:39,620
with access to the Federal Reserve's
borrowing facility and some of the

8
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:43,400
innovations that they have done in that
respect are very good.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,600
I don't think that more cuts in federal
funds rate,

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,340
uh,
are called for.

11
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,970
I think there's a,
there's a significant risk of inflation

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,300
in the current situation.
And so I think the Fed's monetary policy

13
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,510
is not going to continue to cut short
term interest rates.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,250
Now the problem is that,
um,

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,200
that what the Fed did,
for example,

16
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:14,201
in the case of bear stearns,
I'm providing the and in the immediate

17
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:19,080
aftermath of the bear stearns collapsed,
collapsed,

18
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,370
providing access to the discount window,
boring facility for investment banks.

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,880
That was the right thing.
But that was an innovation and policy.

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,830
And what I think needs to happen is that
there needs to be some further thought

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,890
given to the supervisory and regulatory
function of the Fed over institutions

22
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:44,110
like that to go along with this access
to,

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,740
to the feds credit

24
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,540
I,
I tend to not see political solutions to

25
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:59,040
problems like this.
I believe in the independence of the

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,140
Federal Reserve,
but what I do believe is that the next

27
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,141
president ought to take some clues from
the proposals that the treasury

28
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:13,251
secretary and this blue ribbon
commission just put forth to revise the

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,430
regulatory system for financial
institutions and the economy.

30
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,760
I think that needs a little bit of
rethinking,

31
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:27,660
and I think the next president will take
that seriously.

32
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:31,170
We'll have to take that seriously,
whoever that that is.
