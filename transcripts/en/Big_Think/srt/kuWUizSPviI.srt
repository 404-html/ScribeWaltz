1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
Religion is increasingly suppressed
among educated people.

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:06,300
It's not suppressed politically or
legally,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,130
uh,
but my students say,

4
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:11,430
yeah,
I'll as I students in colleges across

5
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:13,170
the country,
um,

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,660
have no concept of what the Bible is or
what's in it.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,930
Think of it as a toxic book.
Know nothing about Christianity,

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,900
less about Judaism.
Um,

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,470
so at the same time when the threats to
human dignity,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,530
dignity and integrity are going to be
ramped up to extraordinary levels of

11
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:35,601
stress where we most need wisdom and
moral seriousness.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,810
We're seeing wisdom and moral
seriousness come under attack.

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:43,620
And often from the same people who want
to do the genetic engineering is

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,210
crusading.
Crusading.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,720
Atheism is sort of a clause today is
popular.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,250
I don't want to say among scientists,
I mean as to do general.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,910
It isn't so,
but there are certainly a prominent

18
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:01,770
people in the scientific community are
prominent people who were religious Jews

19
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,270
or Christians in the scientific
community.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,830
But there are also prominent people,
um,

21
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:08,730
who have taken their atheism to the
public successfully,

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,550
who are crusading atheist,
who preach atheism,

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,230
atheism in an aggressive way.
Um,

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,580
as a consequence of the science,
they play on people's weakness in

25
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,860
ignorance.
So far as most people don't take the

26
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,360
trouble to learn science.
It's easy for a scientist to saying,

27
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:26,220
I'm smarter than you are because I know
it and you don't know.

28
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,770
I understand the genome and you don't.
I understand the physics.

29
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:32,440
I can do hard calculus problems and not
just twelfth grade level one.

30
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:35,070
So you can see how much smarter I am
than than,

31
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,090
than you are.
And what I tell you there,

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,960
there are no moral absolutes and
religion is trash.

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,260
And furthermore,
we ought to go ahead with human cloning.

34
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,470
We should go ahead with genetic
engineering and implantables sorts,

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,530
which will smudge line between human and
machine.

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,180
We're getting into a,
a moral conflict of interest,

37
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,610
which is tremendously dangerous.
I,

38
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,620
I don't think we will succumb.
I mean,

39
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,060
I think,
you know,

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,070
human beings have faced hard challenges.
The Second World War was,

41
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:10,040
is difficult to crisis as mankind ever
will face a,

42
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm 50 million people died.
I'm a humanity.

43
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,190
Teetered on the edge.
I'm a state.

44
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,800
Paganism was preached aggressively by
Hitler.

45
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:23,180
I Germany,
which despised Christianity as much as I

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,040
hated Jews.
It didn't hate Christians as people,

47
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,950
but it hated Christianity.
Um,

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,810
uh,
the Japanese empire,

49
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:35,811
which was a w which revived stay
paganism in preference to the more

50
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:40,620
sophisticated religion of Buddhism and
Christianity that had been popular in

51
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,480
Japan.
Stalinist Russia,

52
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:45,750
which was an aggressively pagan nations,
suppressed Christianity.

53
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:49,170
That was a crisis of enormous crisis.
We rose to the occasion.

54
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,230
We defeated it.
It damaged us.

55
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,380
We still bear the scars.
Um,

56
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,150
I think we're going to face a crisis in
the coming century.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,830
It will be different in character.
He's never the same.

58
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,240
We never see the same crisis twice.
Um,

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,670
I,
I know we have the moral,

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,690
a strength to rise to the occasion,
and I hope and pray that we do in

61
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,230
practice.
