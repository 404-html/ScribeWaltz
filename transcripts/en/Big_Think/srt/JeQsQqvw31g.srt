1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,540
Well,
I probably should clarify my spoon full

2
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:21,211
of sugar.
The way with running with scissors,

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,910
the humor was like a spoonful of sugar,
makes the medicine go down.

4
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:29,340
That's true.
Just as humorous is a life raft in

5
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,930
terrible,
terrible circumstances.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,290
It can kind of float you to the next
safe spot with running with scissors.

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,930
It's not that I would,
um,

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,350
sprinkle some sugar onto a.
I'm a bitter piece.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,900
It's that I would just not,
I would leave out the bigger piece,

10
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,210
you know,
wolf at the table as much darker book,

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Much Darker Book.
Both books though are like icebergs.

12
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,370
I'm tiny,
tiny little chunk above the surface of

13
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:15,301
the water.
Very small but yet kind of know what

14
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,460
else is underneath the water,
you know,

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,390
it's pretty much going to be the same
but more.

16
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,810
And for that reason,
the period of my life and running with

17
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:29,230
scissors was a lot more fun.
It was absolute madness

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,540
and I mean,
I didn't know how I was going to turn

19
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,820
out from that oven,
but it was fun.

20
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,260
But the time of my life before with my
father was not fun.

21
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,060
Um,
and in order to write that wolf book,

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,160
I had to,
um,

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,120
I had to go back in my head to that time
in Shutesbury,

24
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:02,140
Massachusetts and I had to,
um,

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,040
I had to be with him again and even
though I'm a lot older now and he's

26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,450
dead,
uh,

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,210
that is,
you know,

28
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:19,211
interesting information that matters not
at all because these memories are very,

29
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:21,530
um,
they're very vivid,

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,660
very vivid.
So while I was writing that book,

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,390
um,
I was going through all the emotions,

32
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:29,230
you know,
you would go through during the,

33
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,160
I wouldn't want to do it again,
you know,

34
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,630
I wouldn't want to do it again.
It was not fun.

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,110
It was I'm not fun.
And I did it.

36
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,970
Um,
I kinda had to do it for me and then I

37
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,750
decided to publish it because I thought,
you know,

38
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,780
if I,
if I've learned anything from this

39
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:52,220
memoir thing,
it's that all the ways I thought I was a

40
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:56,300
freak.
It turns out there are other freaks that

41
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:56,770
are,
you know,

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,430
or people that have experienced the same
stuff.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,460
So I bet there are a lot of other guys
or I thought of guys who had the same

44
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,420
father who went through the same thing,
and even if there's only a few of them,

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
this is going to be useful for them.
Um,

46
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,890
so that was the story over there with
that.
