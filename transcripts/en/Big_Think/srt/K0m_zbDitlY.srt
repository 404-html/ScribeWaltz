1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,200
As a very famous phrase in the legal
community,

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,010
hard cases make bad law and the
circumstances that apple and the FBI and

3
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:19,430
the Justice Department find themselves
in,

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,640
um,
certainly not by design,

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,670
it's a horrible tragedy that led to it,
but this is a wonderful example of a

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:32,861
very hard case you have without question
somebody who has done an evil,

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,790
evil,
murderous thing and they have used the

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:42,791
device that contains information that
might be not just marginally

9
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:48,161
extraordinarily useful to law
enforcement all over the world,

10
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,540
certainly to the United States in either
solving aspects of this crime or

11
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,660
preventing future atrocities from
occurring.

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,210
No question.
Apple says that it is not it.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,800
This happens to be an apple device.
Apple has designed their devices so that

14
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:11,801
people can protect their information and
now a federal judge has ordered apple to

15
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:16,100
help crack the phone and gain access to
that information.

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,080
And apple in a,
in a very interesting letter from its

17
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,200
CEO,
Tim Cook has said,

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,270
well,
we don't,

19
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,120
we are rejecting the judge's order to
help crack this.

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,130
Why?
Why?

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,850
Because the problem that emerges is do
people have any expectation or

22
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,530
reasonable expectation of privacy when
they use technologies on networks by

23
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,890
exceeding to the judge's request and the
FBI has request a message would be sent

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,040
to people all over the world.
China,

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,020
Europe,
Latin America,

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,080
the US that if a rule of law,
if a judge,

27
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,650
Chinese judge Brazilian judge Russian
judge says that thing that you've

28
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:10,790
encrypted on your device,
we want access to it.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,850
It would basically mean you have no
privacy.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,740
If a rule of law,
and let's be very blunt here,

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,450
Chinese and Russian rule of law
standards are different than American or

32
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,300
British or German.
We will have lost standards.

33
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,930
Nobody could count on their devices to
protect them in any other circumstances.

34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,710
To my mind that is the definition of a
hard case.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,800
I am extraordinarily sympathetic to
apple.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm extraordinarily sympathetic to the
FBI and the Justice Department.

37
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,670
I'm even more sympathetic to the
families of the people who were hurt and

38
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,270
killed in in that,
in that attack,

39
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:57,440
that terrorist attack.
But the reality is this is one of those

40
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:02,441
circumstances where there is no good
answer and what ever answer is chosen is

41
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:03,950
the wrong one.
