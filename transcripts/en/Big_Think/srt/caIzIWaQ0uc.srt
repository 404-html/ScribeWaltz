1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,290
You have a number of,
of,

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:16,291
of success stories in,
in Africa in the last 15 to 20 years.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,250
A country like Ghana has a huge
substantial growth rates.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,720
Uh,
there's some countries in,

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,451
in,
in,

6
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:27,810
in cells in Africa who are also doing
quite well in Asia.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
I was in Bangladesh for a couple of
weeks ago and that's the country facing

8
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,770
enormous challenges.
Uh,

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,290
but there's 150 million people living in
a country,

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,970
something twice the size of Ireland.
I don't know what the appropriate level

11
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:43,870
of state and the United States is,
but it's,

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,650
it's,
it's a small piece of land and,

13
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,221
uh,
you know,

14
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,520
they've been growing against all the
odds and surviving.

15
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:53,730
There's still huge poverty,
but they're still making some progress.

16
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,350
And obviously,
as are some other cases in,

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,180
particularly in Asia,
places like Cambodia who have came out

18
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:04,230
of a dreadful,
a internal conflict 30,

19
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,600
30 odd years ago and have made a lot of
progress.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,900
So I think the foundation stones have to
be good governance.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,690
I think countries have to invest in
education,

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,820
uh,
obviously,

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,470
uh,
set and get,

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,130
find some way of partnership between
governments and civil society and

25
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,780
governments I think have to be willing
to give the space to civil society to

26
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,781
enable them to make the cost
contribution and enable at over time

27
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:37,890
institutional development for that
governmental and nongovernmental level

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,220
to develop an,
and,

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,780
and that is ultimately,
I think what needs to be done in,

30
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,614
in,
in,

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,960
uh,
in a country.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,970
And obviously good,
well grounded policy policy is

33
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:51,691
important.
I mean,

34
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,820
policy that we'll,
uh,

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,300
we'll put attend if in a country,
for example,

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,350
uh,
that has a big proportion of its economy

37
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,960
dealing in agriculture.
There has to be a,

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,280
you know,
uh,

39
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:09,780
do focus on that.
And I think the food crisis earlier this

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,680
year brought it home to people that for
the last 20 to 30 years,

41
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:18,630
agriculture and rural development as a
sector has largely been neglected.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,790
And there is a daunting at,
at,

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,620
on leaders both at national and
international level,

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,940
that that has to change.
