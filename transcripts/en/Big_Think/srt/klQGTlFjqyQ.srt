1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,240
I would advise anyone including myself
that any moment you are,

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,370
you understand your life is good.
Then everything that's led up to it was

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,410
worthwhile.
And the reason I say that,

4
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:25,000
it's not that I haven't laid mistake,
I'd made some glorious mistakes and I

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,030
suffered in my life for those mistakes.
But I'm sitting here talking to you this

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,970
morning and my world.
I am too concerned with the,

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,650
the,
the problems.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,410
Uh,
then in trailer parks everywhere.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,650
But in my personal world,
I couldn't be happier.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,560
I have six kids.
They delight me thoroughly and they are

11
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:55,561
all very close with one another and our
family get togethers at the best thing

12
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,780
going in my life.
So I figure

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,520
if I can say that at this moment,
feel that at this moment it wouldn't

14
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:09,460
change anything that got me here.
You know,

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,740
all of the mistakes,
all the drama,

16
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:16,741
all of the bullshit that went on earlier
that so much of which I was responsible

17
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:19,414
for.

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,290
If the,
if the moment you're at is a great

19
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,020
moment and you're happy for who you are
at this moment,

20
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:30,010
that everything that got you here is
worthwhile because it's all gone.

21
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:32,940
That's yesterday.
The two,

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,900
two of the most important words I think,
uh,

23
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,370
are over in next.
When somebody is over,

24
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,750
it is over.
And then we're all onto the next and the

25
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:51,751
hammock in the middle between those two
words is what I think is meant by truly

26
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,450
living in the moment.
You know,

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,340
when I get it from this interview,
it's greatest was

28
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,830
there ain't anything I can do if I wish
to fix or change or I've done it next.

29
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,210
So I think being invested in next and
not the past,

30
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:16,690
it's best.
