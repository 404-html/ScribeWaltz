1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,800
I think the locavore movement is
brilliant and it all makes perfect sense

2
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:17,801
because we went from kind of in the
fifties and sixties in America it was

3
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:23,321
all about convenience and anytime you
cooked it was French food and then in

4
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,170
the seventies and eighties it was this
explosion of world cuisines and we

5
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:32,171
learned about Mexican and not just
Mexican but well hawkin and food from

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,500
Veracruz and we learned about Italian
food and Italian food food,

7
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:41,080
but food from Ramon Emilia Romano and
from the glorious.

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,410
So,
um,

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,710
there's been this evolution of knowledge
and sophistication and it's all kind of

10
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:52,460
come back down into where the food from,
where you're from.

11
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,490
And even at the local board term has
only been coined two years ago in San

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,843
Francisco.
Um,

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,350
it makes a lot of sense.
I mean,

14
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,260
essentially what it is,
is a food will have movement that says

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,050
you should really,
your diet should really be consisting of

16
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:10,670
food that has been harvested or process
from within 100 mile radius of your

17
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,504
home.

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,410
And that makes a lot of sense because
you're sustaining the farmers.

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,950
You're eating food that is as nutrient
rich as possible.

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,070
You are contributing to the greening of
the planets by doing this and you're

21
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:29,540
helping small businesses grow in your
area.

22
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:34,541
So those are all very important points
and hopefully the food is organic.

23
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:39,660
Hopefully it's been harvested,
are processed in a really healthy green

24
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,170
way.
You are really thinking globally and

25
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:45,170
acting locally.
I mean it really is kind of the fruition

26
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,290
of that concept which was,
you know,

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,360
the in the last 10 years so that you're
really helping sustain your area and the

28
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:58,340
people that live within your radius.
So to me it makes a lot of sense and

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,010
it's the way that we,
we lived all those years ago and it,

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,350
in terms of health,
it makes the most sense for sure because

31
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,440
what it does is it forces you to eat in
a much more healthy manner.
