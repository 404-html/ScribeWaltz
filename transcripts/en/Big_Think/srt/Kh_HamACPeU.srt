1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,543
No,

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,803
Nah,

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,270
not really.
I mean,

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,290
it's funny.
I,

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,180
I,
I,

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,280
I don't,
again,

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,790
maybe because I don't think about,
I don't think about it enough.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,290
Um,
it's funny because I now live in New

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,290
Jersey and,
uh,

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,960
I,
you know,

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,910
I've just start,
I've just moved out there and I'm

12
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,170
experimenting with,
with,

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,230
with the great commute.
And so I'm taking a train from the outer

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,600
still somewhat pastoral suburbs into
Manhattan and on that train ride,

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,320
um,
between the towns of [inaudible] and far

16
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,770
hills,
I was looking out the window the other

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,770
day and I looked out the window and
they're on the tops of this abandoned

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,680
line of telephone poles that were in
between the fields and,

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,880
and the kind of no man's land of the
track on these abandoned telephone

20
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:11,410
poles,
which dated to probably around 1900

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,680
where these gorgeous turquoise and jade
green colored glass insulators on the

22
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,410
Poles.
And these were what they used to,

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,820
you know,
protect the wiring.

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,720
Now these glass insulators stopped being
used in 1915,

25
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,040
1920 being actively made and they
switched into more one more modern

26
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,041
materials to protect these.
And I looked at this absolute,

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,510
you know,
almost,

28
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,400
you know,
it predates the machine age.

29
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,560
I looked at this glass,
these glass insulators,

30
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,810
and I have,
I've been collecting them for years.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,370
So to see them out the window still in c
two as they would say,

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,830
I'm still in their original,
you know,

33
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:57,280
moment was,
was just so gratifying.

34
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,130
And so it was like the,
it was like the best moment of the week

35
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:04,060
for me because although part of me wants
to now go out there and climb up the

36
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,180
telephone poles and like try and extract
them because I'm like,

37
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,110
well,
no one's using them.

38
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:10,030
This is just,
it's no different than hunting for old

39
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:10,864
bottles.

40
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,920
I could be arrested,
but you know,

41
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,020
I've got to check with the local Amtrak
police there.

42
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:24,410
But I think the thing is,
is that if you look at those insulators

43
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:29,411
on those poles,
and you see how folks designed something

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,540
truly beautiful to protect the
technology of the time,

45
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,080
there was this glass case that went over
the ones and it was a very about the

46
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:42,230
function because they had to keep the
water out to stop the,

47
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,700
uh,
the wires from corroding.

48
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,990
But these are gorgeous.
And I know folks out there who have

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,990
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
different examples of these glass,

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,030
you know,
glass pieces.

51
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,990
And so seeing something like that,
an artifact from the early era,

52
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,910
seeing that out in that kind of,
you know,

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,200
I love looking at a train because we're
always looking at people's backyards.

54
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,880
And when you look out there and you see
these,

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,270
these,
these ornaments that served a function

56
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,420
made me think about design again in a
fresh way.

57
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,070
But maybe it made me want to just go out
and get them.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh,
I don't know.

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,750
That's my style.
