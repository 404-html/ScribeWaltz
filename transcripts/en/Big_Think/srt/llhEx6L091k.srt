1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,700
There are
the beginnings of an intellectual

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,030
revulsion at,
at what conservatives,

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,090
what has been done to conservatism as a
governing philosophy in America.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,940
Um,
and I think one of the roles of the day,

5
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,941
the dishes now trying to,
to play is to be a place where those

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,030
voices can be,
can be brought to a wider audience.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,600
So I think of Bruce Bartlett who along
with me in the early part of the Bush

8
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,460
administration,
called them out on that fiscal

9
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,180
irresponsibility is a voice that I'm
very happy to,

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,920
to,
to keep bringing.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,910
I think a much later,
someone like David Frum has come to that

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,690
recognition even though I think we're
still going to disagree about foreign

13
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,370
policy.
I think,

14
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,340
um,
there are some libertarian voices that

15
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,960
are out there.
Um,

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,700
and I think a younger generation of
reasoned people I think of,

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,270
I think of people like Damon linker.

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,250
Um,
uh,

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,920
there are,
there are people out there.

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,650
Uh,
unfortunately what's happened in

21
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,910
Washington and more generally is that
the conservative movement is bankrolled

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,130
by certain large donors and with certain
overwhelming interests.

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,120
Um,
and they police the discourse with a

24
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:26,121
ferocity and a lockstep mentality that
has frozen conservatism as a,

25
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,700
as a,
as a philosophy in place.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,480
Um,
and turned it into an ideology that kind

27
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:35,910
of ever change,
um,

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,040
or Alijah it with such fundamentalist
concepts that there can be no real

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,340
conservative dialogue because dialogue
is not what fundamentalism is about.

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,510
Uh,
and the price of lip simply existing as

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,420
a,
a conservative in Washington to be in

32
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:59,421
good standing is to obey the dictates of
whichever this constellation of donors

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,290
and organizations from heritage to Aei,
um,

34
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,480
to even something like pajamas media,
which is apparently financed by people

35
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,530
who are also financing West Bank
settlements.

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,190
Um,
is if,

37
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:18,540
if you stray,
you are expelled.

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,990
And then also thoroughly demonized.
So intellectually we are,

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,870
you know,
the blogosphere allows these kinds of

40
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,130
ideas to percolate and I mean kind of
Fritos door for example,

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,950
is a young conservative,
uh,

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,980
whom I've brought on specifically with
the mandate of because find and courage

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,300
let us bring to light young writers
right of center who are not yet,

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,710
have not been yet basically bought by
this establishment.

45
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,770
And then coerced to certain positions.
Daniel Larson is another person.

46
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,910
Now these people don't normally agree by
any means.

47
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,170
That's the point.
I mean,

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,940
but they do not,
they,

49
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,900
they have acknowledged that conservatism
in the past 10,

50
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,370
15,
20 years.

51
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,150
It's not that there was a great period
of pure,

52
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,070
great conservatives and we've never had
this,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,110
some of these populist,
xenophobic,

54
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,570
racist,
bigoted strains.

55
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,100
It's that that was always there.
Um,

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,950
it is that there was also a lot of good
stuff there that we were responding to

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,750
contingent situations such as the
collapse of the social democracy model

58
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,440
in the 1970s and a really smart critique
of the welfare state.

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,480
And a really,
I think,

60
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,380
critical insight into how one defeats
solving communism.

61
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,320
What's,
what's happened is that all that stuff

62
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,340
has slowly been marginalized and well,
the worst has come to the surface.

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,250
Um,
and that,

64
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:58,450
that won't change overnight.
And I think from everything we're seeing

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,820
talk radio and,
uh,

66
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,300
these,
I think essentially corrupting

67
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,290
institutions in Washington are turning
conservatism into something that really

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,110
very creepy,
but also emotionally and psychically

69
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:16,111
powerful for people.
So all you do is all you can do is is

70
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,680
write books,
write articles,

71
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,290
write blogs that articulate

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,500
what you believe.
