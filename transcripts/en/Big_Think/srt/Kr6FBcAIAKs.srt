1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,140
There's definitely a trend,
which I had not a word I love to use,

2
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,360
but it's,
there's definitely a move,

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,680
let's say towards,
you know,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,530
people,
people that are thoughtful about their

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,140
space and their interiors are now even
being thoughtful about,

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,450
you know,
sort of the,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,840
the,
the amount of,

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,070
uh,
you've sort of,

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,980
uh,
you know,

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,180
chemicals are putting into their space
or amount of,

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,253
you know,
just the,

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,440
the surfaces and what they're made out
of and off gassing.

13
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,970
And um,
you know,

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,590
volatile organic compounds is what
people are thinking about.

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,900
Um,
and so when,

16
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,330
when someone says something's low voc,
that's what,

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,180
that's what voc means.
And um,

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,590
you know,
generally when we think of,

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,950
um,
you know,

20
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,790
uh,
environmentally friendly interiors,

21
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,310
I,
what I'm used to seeing are these very

22
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,210
kind of like a very sparse,
very kind of clean,

23
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,640
very,
um,

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,800
you know,
I call them,

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,720
you know,
hemp world kind of interiors and,

26
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,660
and they're cool and I actually love the
look of that very minimal.

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,110
But one of the things that we were
discussing with the client that a,

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,890
I designed this apartment for in,
in River House,

29
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,600
in New York City,
was that,

30
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,450
um,
environmentally friendly interiors don't

31
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:19,290
have to necessarily be anesthetic,
they need to be your aesthetic.

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,900
And even going back to what I was
talking about before,

33
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:22,840
where,
you know,

34
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,320
my,
I,

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,420
I try to design spaces that are very
personal.

36
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,110
So the idea was that I wanted to do an
interior designing interior that was

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,610
filled with a,
the personality of,

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,590
of the project for the client and tells
her story,

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,500
but does it in an environmentally
friendly way.

40
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,930
So this,
the photograph you're looking at right

41
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:46,950
now,
um,

42
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,160
of this living room,
uh,

43
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,220
this is the living room at river house.
It was all every single piece of

44
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,520
furniture from the curtain hardware,
recycled metal.

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,180
The dining table was recycled,
zinc and paperstone top,

46
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,680
uh,
the chairs were in.

47
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,660
They were,
uh,

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,780
they were made from all the furniture,
the coffee tables that are all made from

49
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,370
certified woods.
Uh,

50
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,170
they're,
you know,

51
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,500
uh,
with,

52
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,990
with low voc finishes on them.
Uh,

53
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:20,991
the rug was made from a vintage claims
that were tattered and worn that we cut

54
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:25,500
up and then we connected them locally
with a organic,

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,230
uh,
felt and then put them on organic pads

56
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,800
and the finishes,
the or the glues for the wall covering

57
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,650
were low voc,
the wallpaper's themselves or

58
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:38,160
sustainable,
it was just the fills for the furniture

59
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,750
are organic.
It just,

60
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,411
it,
you know,

61
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,730
at every level we basically measured how
green,

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
you know,
I always talk about it being shades of

63
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,150
green and we took and said,
okay,

64
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,500
how can this piece be?
Some things are more green than others.

65
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,030
Um,
and you know,

66
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:59,031
the lamps that flank the sofa are made
from a vintage wine bottles that are

67
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:05,860
sitting on certified a walnut plants
with handmade twine,

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,330
natural twine,
uh,

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,790
um,
lampshades locally made,

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,870
um,
the,

71
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,860
the light fixture over the dining table
is made from recycled jet engine parts.

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,040
The light next to the dining table,
there's a pair of floor lamps that are

73
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:23,041
made from a recycled plumbing parts.
So there's an element at,

74
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:28,381
at almost each piece has a,
a real sort of lineage.

75
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,191
Uh,
you know,

76
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:32,770
that that connects it to being
environmentally friendly.

77
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,620
But overall I think when you walk into
the space,

78
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,170
you wouldn't look at this and think,
oh,

79
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:42,280
this is definitely ecofriendly interior.
It just feels like,

80
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,400
I think an interesting space that's kind
of fun.

81
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,370
It's sexy,
it feels fresh,

82
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,890
it feels stylish.
I think that it employs taste to a

83
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,600
certain level and I guess that's
subjective,

84
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,440
but I do think that it,
you know,

85
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:58,274
it,
there's,

86
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,470
there's a balance.
Uh,

87
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,071
there's,
you know,

88
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,790
all of the elements that I think,
you know,

89
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,890
sort of a defined what's,
what,

90
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:07,850
what is tasteful or pleasing to the eye.
I think it employs a,

91
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,280
those,
um,

92
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,300
those elements.

93
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,700
So I think it's,
you know,

94
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,800
I think it's a very well rounded space
and I think when you look at it,

95
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,290
um,
you know,

96
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,760
it,
it,

97
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,450
it,
it evokes emotions that I hope are

98
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,180
positive and I talk about it in my book
or you know,

99
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,220
about the things that I look for it,
I,

100
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,200
I,
that I put that are sort of incorporate

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,780
into all of my designs.
I want them to be fresh.

102
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:32,230
I want them to be inviting,
I want them to be unpretentious.

103
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,130
I want them to be stylish.
Uh,

104
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,150
I want them to be sexy.
I want them to be inviting.

105
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,050
I want,
you know,

106
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,700
so you're,
you're at every,

107
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,050
you know,
every interior and some,

108
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,430
some depending on the spaces or the
client or the situation are more fun

109
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,470
than sexy or more comfortable or less
comfortable or less inviting,

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,000
more inviting,
but they have to be there at some level

111
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,430
and,
and,

112
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,940
and represent and be part of the
collective.

113
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,380
And I think that,
you know,

114
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,680
that ultimately that balance and how you
balance that,

115
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,710
those emotions are really what,
what kind of defines how people

116
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,610
emotionally connect with a space.
And I think that is what that emotional

117
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,650
connection is.
What people are.

118
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,400
You use the term taste in,
you know,

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,050
in,
in,

120
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,150
in terms of,
you know,

121
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,490
relating that experience.

122
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,640
One of my favorite interiors in New York
and um,

123
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,080
it is,
uh,

124
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,260
the four seasons restaurant.
I love it because I think it,

125
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,851
it,
you know,

126
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:37,780
it,
it's just,

127
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,550
it's glamorous,
it's fun.

128
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,610
Um,
it is definitely,

129
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,781
you know,
you know,

130
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,720
the moment,
if not the week it was timed,

131
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,580
you know,
based on interior.

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,250
Um,
it just,

133
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:51,701
you know,
it's a,

134
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:55,720
it's a very cool.
It was cool from the beginning.

135
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,500
It's been cool ever since.
It never,

136
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,530
it's just always been an interesting,
fabulous space and design and when I'm

137
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,540
in,
when I'm in there I feel,

138
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,270
you know,
my emotional reaction to it as like,

139
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,250
I just think it's,
I think it's really awesome.

140
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,010
So I think in,
in New York that's one of my favorite,

141
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,180
uh,
interiors I would say my other favorite

142
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:21,170
interior in New York as my apartment,
I think you have to really like your

143
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
space.

144
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,140
I think you have to really be
comfortable in your space.

145
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,330
You should really like,
and they should always be kind of

146
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,660
challenging,
you know,

147
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,330
and adding and it should always
organically be evolving.

148
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,310
Um,
but I do like my space.

149
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
Um,
and I think you always,

150
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,110
you know,
you could fall in love with so many

151
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,790
interiors.
Um,

152
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,490
and,
and a lot of times it's not even just

153
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,840
the whole,
the whole space,

154
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:49,040
it's just you can fall in love with
pieces in and think that's a really

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
interesting concept or idea and sort of
put that in your,

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,930
you know,
kind of like your,

157
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,050
your,
your file cabinet of good ideas.

158
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,020
Um,
I would say God through the world,

159
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,070
um,
I mean the US,

160
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,650
there's enough.
I,

161
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,170
I would,
I would,

162
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,130
you know,
New York City is such an international

163
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,650
city.
So there's,

164
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:12,940
so,
there's so much.

165
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,740
Um,
there's so many influences,

166
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:16,450
which I think is really fabulous.

167
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,380
I would say as a city,
I love Chicago because I think it's an

168
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,050
amazing American city and the
architecture is really incredible.

169
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,380
Um,
I think it's a great representation of,

170
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,230
you know,
I always say when people come to us and

171
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:29,561
they say,
Oh,

172
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,410
I love New York first time here,
I say,

173
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:32,250
well,
you know,

174
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,280
this is like an international city.
Chicago is a true example of an American

175
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:38,500
city,
I think,

176
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,220
or the best example of an American city
that Philip Johnson's glass house I

177
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,990
love,
but I have to say on the property,

178
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:47,200
I also love the old farm house on the
same property.

179
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,130
It's,
that's a difficult question for me.

180
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,020
I mean,
I think that,

181
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,860
you know,
you know,

182
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,980
worldwide I would say some of my
favorite interiors are very humble

183
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,630
spaces,
um,

184
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,530
that are really not designed in.
There were kind of reaction to,

185
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,590
you know,
making,

186
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,590
making things work.
You know,

187
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,170
I've spent a lot of time in Greece,
the Greek islands,

188
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,000
and you know,
a lot of my favorite,

189
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,580
uh,
spaces are really just kind of very

190
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,320
simple,
very clean.

191
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,460
I'm open and kind of utilitarian at a
certain level.
