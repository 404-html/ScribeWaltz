00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,740
Do an interview with you,
Chuck Feeney with a billionaire who gave

2
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,800
away all of his,
uh,

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,200
molly and he,
he,

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,640
he did it,
he did it.

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,163
I'll give you an example.
I brought them onto the sales survival 

6
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,760
school for,
for the artists language,

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,940
and I was trying to encourage him to 
give some money to it.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,900
And when we released,
he said to me this was,

9
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,734
this was this good where parents had a 
financed by running ruffles and know 

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,243
there that will sort of fundraising 
projects and the kids were all in this 

11
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,084
big,
this big hall and they were getting a 

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,883
brilliant education.
So he's had the baby when we went 

13
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,470
through the whole thing.
And I thought he was hiding impressed by

14
00:00:59,471 --> 00:00:59,871
it.
He says,

15
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:03,140
I'm not going to give them any money.
And I said,

16
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,400
why not?
And they said,

17
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,990
well,
they're doing very well,

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,380
but perhaps if I give them money they 
wouldn't do as well.

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,440
So I would take a leaf from his,
uh,

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,450
experience of philanthropy and put it 
into sustainable projects.
