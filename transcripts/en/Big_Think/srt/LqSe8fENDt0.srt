1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You have to slow down and slowing down
means you have to reflect and it means

2
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:12,390
that you have to listen and listen and
listen some more.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,930
When you start to truly listen,
what happens is that you begin to again,

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,650
self reflect and that isn't necessarily
the most comfortable thing.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,410
Over the last 25 years in working in
professional service firms over and over

6
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,120
again,
I would find myself talking with

7
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:41,121
conversing with individuals who in many
respects never wanted to slow down

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,380
incredibly smart,
a little bit defensive when you gave

9
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,480
them feedback,
um,

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
felt in many respects that they were
really good at everything that they did,

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,120
um,
without ever asking actually some tough

12
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:00,720
questions about whether they really were
competent or not in things like

13
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:05,721
management,
who after a while seem to spend more

14
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,761
time managing their image than actually
worrying about are,

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,150
am I really improving or am I trying new
things?

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,030
And it seemed like that they were
becoming more and more frightened.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm about about some very,
very basic things while their lives seem

18
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,430
to be working and they seem to be
progressing and they seem to be

19
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:30,780
achieving and accomplishing.
If for some reason you tell them that

20
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:32,940
they're falling down in a particular
area,

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,360
what happens is they begin to see
themselves as an absolute failure as

22
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,290
opposed to saying,
well,

23
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,370
you know,
I'm overwhelmed.

24
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,200
I have a lot of things that I need to
balance.

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,290
Anything that gets in the way of them
not accomplishing at the end of the day

26
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:51,141
starts to feel like a distraction.
Often relationships begin to suffer with

27
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,380
these individuals.
They find themselves rather than

28
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,140
listening with their children,
they find themselves asking for

29
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,760
accountability.
They find themselves a giving directions

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,900
and offering advice.
They find themselves asking questions

31
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,220
like,
what did you do today?

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Have you done your homework?
Have you applied for college?

33
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,850
I mean,
you're seven years old.

34
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,280
Why aren't you applying for college?
How was your room dirty?

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,870
And so they're still in that role of
accomplish.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,380
Check things off.
When you start having those kinds of

37
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,730
feelings of,
you know what?

38
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,280
I may be inadequate and these other
dimensions.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,870
What you do is you find yourself going
faster and faster.
