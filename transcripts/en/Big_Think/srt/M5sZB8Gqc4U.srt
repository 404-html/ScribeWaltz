1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,440
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,410
there are many big challenges today.
On the one hand,

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:17,411
there are the mass atrocities.
Places liked r four or I'm eastern

4
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:19,970
Congo,
where where many,

5
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:24,500
many people are killed and displaced.
There are highly repressive governments,

6
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:29,501
say North Korea or Burma or Uzbekistan
or Turkmenistan where just the severity

7
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,950
of the government repression deserves
attention.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,460
There are places where wars have become
so chaotic that,

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,350
that the lack of government is a
problem.

10
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:45,680
I think Iraq as an example of that.
So in that sense,

11
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:50,390
there are many situations where,
where violence and repression call out

12
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,640
for urgent attention,
but there are other,

13
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,700
you know,
quieter forms of abuse that we tend not

14
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,620
to,
you tend not to see in the headlines,

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,950
but that nonetheless affect many,
many people quite severely.

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,980
And here I think about say that the
severe restrictions on,

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,460
on the rights of women that exist in
many parts of the world.

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,280
Um,
I think about migrant workers who were

19
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:15,281
forced to travel long distances and in a
foreign environment often are exist

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,890
completely without respect for rights.
I'm wholly at the whim of their

21
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:20,840
employer.
I think about,

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,420
you know,
children who may be drafted to be

23
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,850
soldiers,
I'll Mariano physically seized and

24
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:30,350
course to become soldiers or who have to
serve as as domestics in lieu of going

25
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:32,480
to school.
So there are many of these quieter

26
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,220
issues that don't get into the
headlines,

27
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:36,590
but that are also quite acute problems
as well.
