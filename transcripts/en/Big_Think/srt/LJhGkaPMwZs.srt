1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,960
One of the problems that we always have
is that the kind of culture,

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,720
uh,
in which save children involved,

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,200
um,
it's hard to replicate in our current,

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,640
uh,
in our current culture.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,880
So I always say sort of ideally what
you'd have is a six to one ratio where

6
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,580
you could have six grownups taking care
of each child.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,370
Um,
and I mean maybe a better way of putting

8
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,910
it is that you'd have a community of
parents,

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,670
you'd have a community of caregivers.
The children are there as part of that

10
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,610
community.
It's not as if anybody is sitting there

11
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:41,700
and doing a bunch of special things that
are just directed at the child.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,510
So the vision that we have from school,
there's someone who's got this special

13
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:50,460
responsibility of shaping education of
the child is the vision that is often

14
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:54,510
imported into being a parent.
So there's some special set of things

15
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,470
you should do,
some,

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,220
you know,
flashcards or video or something other

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,390
than what you would normally do.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,390
That's the thing that you are supposed
to do to educate the child.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,410
And what the data,
the research shows is that children are

20
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:11,220
learning from just observing and
participating in the everyday thing was

21
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,000
that people are doing in an incredibly
subtle and powerful way.

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,920
So all the conscious,
I mean the irony is that the unconscious

23
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,680
things that you do when you're,
when you're interacting with children

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,130
are much more likely to shape and affect
the way they think then any of the

25
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,020
things that you actually consciously
decide to do.

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,840
Um,
and I think we have some lovely models

27
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,150
for the way that,
for example,

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,980
you know,
my personal favorite is cooking.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,580
So my grandchildren come in and cook
with me.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,480
Children love cooking,
they love being involved in,

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,940
there's nothing that seems more
interesting to them.

32
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,580
Then an adult,
she's actually trying to do something,

33
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:51,570
actually trying to bring something about
and integrating them into that work.

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,510
So in a sense in,
in the village,

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,570
the line between here's work and here's
children just wasn't there.

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,600
Now the question is what do we do now to
try to,

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,550
uh,
when that's no longer true,

38
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,050
we are no longer growing up in a
village.

39
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,750
What can we do now to kind of recreate
that situation?

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,190
And I think the best preschools
essentially recreate that village for

41
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,770
children.
So what they do is put children in a

42
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,580
context with a lot of adults who really
care about them,

43
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,620
who are,
who are warm,

44
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,410
who were supportive and lots of stuff
for them to play with.

45
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,580
Um,
another thing,

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,060
another thing I say sometimes if you
really wanted to know what children,

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,430
preschool children,
young children need to thrive.

48
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,500
They need mud,
livestock and relatives.

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,070
And those are things that are in sort of
short supply.

50
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:42,210
But we can try and say a,
a good preschool to replace the mud,

51
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,130
uh,
livestock and relatives with,

52
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,400
uh,
good teachers and cocoons and

53
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,380
caterpillars and sandboxes.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
But that's much more what young children
are learning for.

55
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:57,480
Then all the kind of very scholastic
academic activities that parents feel as

56
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:00,580
if they need to engage in.
And I think that also makes life as a

57
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,540
working parent easier than if you think
that you have one job and then you have

58
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,220
another job to think that,
uh,

59
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,100
you have a job and then you have this
relationship.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,160
This kind of a form of love that you
have with these children that you're

61
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,990
engaged in.
It's not the same thing as work.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Part of the trouble in our culture in
our society is that we measure

63
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,720
everything.
We treat everything as if it's either a

64
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,760
kind of production or a kind of
consumption.

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,200
So from that perspective,
either having children is an extremely

66
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:36,610
badly paid job or else it's an extremely
expensive luxury.

67
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,210
Um,
and caregiving for children and for

68
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:44,470
people in general just isn't a kind of
production or a kind of consumption.

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,170
It's its own thing.
It's a deep,

70
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,910
important part of being human beings
that we make these profound commitments

71
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,730
to other people.
We care about those people.

72
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,850
We do what we can to let those people
thrive on their own terms and in their

73
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,130
own way.
That's a deep thing that we do

74
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:06,550
specifically about children,
but it's a part of our relationships

75
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,700
with spouses.
It's a part of our relationships with

76
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,320
say,
our parents when they get older and we

77
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,960
have to take care of them.
And it's something that's kind of

78
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,280
invisible in our culture at large
because it doesn't fit into the

79
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,830
production bucket or the consumption
bucket.

80
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,520
One way to think about it is instead of
thinking about parenting,

81
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,800
we should be thinking about being a
parent.

82
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,570
And it's interesting that we don't,
you know,

83
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:32,980
we don't wive our husbands and we don't
friend our friends and we don't child

84
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,814
our parents.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,560
We wouldn't measure the quality of any
of those relationships by saying,

86
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,460
oh,
let's see,

87
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:40,870
is my husband actually,
you know,

88
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,080
has he achieved his benchmarks?
Is he better than he was,

89
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,870
uh,
when I married him.

90
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,540
Um,
you work at relationships,

91
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,680
you put time and energy into them,
but you don't think of them as in this

92
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,820
kind of shaping,
uh,

93
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,570
in this kind of shaping process.
And one of the things that makes

94
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:02,080
caregiving so interesting,
so much more interesting than it is on

95
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,230
the parenting model,
is these deep tensions,

96
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:10,231
these kinds of paradoxes that come in
caregiving where we have to go from

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,960
taking care of the most dependent
creature we know of a human baby who

98
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:18,070
completely requires us to make decisions
for them too,

99
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,210
to keep them alive.
And the outcome of all that is to try to

100
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,660
create an adult who's completely
independent of us,

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,390
who's completely autonomous,
who can make decisions,

102
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:32,080
including making terrible decisions
independently of us.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,480
In some sense,
if your children don't have the

104
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,990
potential to fail,
then you haven't succeeded as a parent.

105
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,030
Because what you want to do as a parent
is make someone who's independent and

106
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:48,031
autonomous enough so they can take risks
and taking risks means the possibility

107
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,800
of failure.
That's a really different,

108
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,010
that's a different kind of activity
than,

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,270
than almost any other kind of human
activity.

110
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,710
And it's deep and profound and it's a
big reason that human beings have been

111
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:01,420
able to succeed as well as they have.
