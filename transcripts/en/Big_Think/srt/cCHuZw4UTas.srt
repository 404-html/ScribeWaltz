1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,750
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,180
are you talking about it is informed
risk taking an informed risk taking in

3
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:22,540
that culture is fundamental towards
supporting innovation.

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,460
Number two,
they've got to be an educated

5
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:26,340
population,
uh,

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,410
if,
if you're working on something that you

7
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:34,411
don't quite understand the probability
of making it better by messing with it,

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,850
just reduced.
So if just think about those two tenants

9
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,010
for awhile,
a culture that supports it,

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,650
and then number two,
then,

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,460
uh,
enough,

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,810
enough education and knowledge and
teamwork to be able to go to go build

13
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,180
it,
that there are very few individuals

14
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:55,660
anymore they can understand one of our
products and some of them have over a

15
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:58,120
billion transistors.
It's hard to know what each one of them

16
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,320
does,
right?

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,850
So there are teams of people that create
these and they're bigger teams of people

18
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,550
that try to validate them and distribute
them,

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,423
et cetera.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,330
So if I was thinking about a third
thing,

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,030
it would be about building that culture
of teamwork and allowing teams then

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040
being innovative
at the Intel fellow level,

23
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,690
the top,
the very top approximately hundred

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,330
scientists and technologists that we
have,

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,650
we tell them they can have half the time
to themselves and they can go work in

26
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,390
that.
Very few of them actually take us up on

27
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:36,800
that.
But the offer is genuine now it means in

28
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,020
some,
in some area that they have some

29
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,160
expertise,
right?

30
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,080
Um,
we actually haven't really faced a lot

31
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:50,081
of that difficulty because because our
products are so incredibly complex,

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,560
beautifully complex,
one could argue and because there's so

33
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:59,180
much change that goes on all the time.
So if you're interested in the field of

34
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:02,690
computing,
working for Intel is just our great

35
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:03,710
place to be.
Right.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,880
And they have a tendency to work in,
to work in work in that area.

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,260
Now we,
we try to go off and then there was a

38
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:17,261
pretty formal process for determining in
the R and d labs what technology's still

39
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:24,560
hold promise and when to kind of reduce
the funding in an area.

40
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,120
And when and when to move it forward.
So we have a lot of process until it's a

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,770
process driven company.
We have a lot of processes that do that,

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
but fundamentally the idea is that you
can do most of the development in the

43
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:40,160
area of expertise,
some form of computing.

44
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,500
And then in the research labs
themselves,

45
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,250
a very organized process to determine
which ones we continue to find out which

46
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,500
ones we,
uh,

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
uh,
we pass on.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
Well,
there's the culture.

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,110
The first one I answered the tenants of
the culture would be first you have to

50
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,700
respect that.
And that means doesn't always work.

51
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,510
The second one is education.
Talked about that.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,700
See if there's a third one.
Oh,

53
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,180
well,
I think the third one is really you have

54
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,030
to just feel inwardly wonderful about
the success.

55
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,430
So if you step back and say,
okay,

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,740
you're allowed to fail,
and then people are educated,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,580
then do you really celebrate those
people that can move it forward.

58
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,180
And sometimes a team moves it forward
and then sometimes you know,

59
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,210
just one person makes a difference.
And we give away the intel achievement

60
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,140
awards every year and lots of times
those are teams of people where,

61
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,560
you know,
our team has done something really

62
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,290
innovative and you have a little bit of
money,

63
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,480
but we give them a great party,
uh,

64
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,090
that every once in a while it was just
one individual who stands up and it's so

65
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:54,091
clear at the corporate level that that
one person moved intel and those are

66
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,534
really special.

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,010
We,
we,

68
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,350
we do throw the party,
but it's not that much of it.

69
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,580
Um,
let's step back and say what innovation

70
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,070
really is.
Innovation is the ability to build a new

71
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:13,240
product or new service in some way that
that betters the product line or

72
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,660
hopefully is solving a customer need
better than before.

73
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,260
So we reward that.
First of all,

74
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,660
this is a,
be careful what you ask for.

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,330
You know,
really good design engineers have a

76
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,270
tendency to then become group leads and
they can certainly move up that

77
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:30,340
engineering chain.
We allow,

78
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,360
we allow scientists and engineers to
either move up into a management change

79
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,420
or stay on their technical leadership
towards an Intel fellow.

80
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,420
And an Intel fellow board until senior
fellow is the same,

81
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,580
you know,
range in the company,

82
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:49,030
same grade,
same salary if not more than vice

83
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,190
presidents.
So there is,

84
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,540
you know,
we,

85
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,930
we kind of put our money where I'm out
there and we recruit,

86
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,160
retain and we award those people that
can move this technology forward in,

87
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,470
in,
in a meaningful way.

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,820
And then the second thing,
which I keep trying to say what really

89
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:10,440
makes it work,
you've got people around you that shared

90
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,400
this culture that want to be doing it
too,

91
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,830
that when you know,
when you call them up at at night and

92
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,341
you say,
yeah,

93
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,080
I know it's after work,
but I just got to talk to you about

94
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,330
this.
I'm so excited and they don't hang up on

95
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,320
you.
So I think it's that combination of

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,430
respecting the individual and in dealing
with all the management structures and

97
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:30,490
changes and challenges that result by
then second of all,

98
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:32,770
having a culture and being able to
recruit other people into the

99
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:35,780
organization that share that common goal
set.

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,670
There are a lot of people that would say
that we have lost some of that edge and

101
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:47,671
some would argue with that vehemently.
So let me just point out the data,

102
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,040
right?
The data are that,

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,280
that we're no longer producing the most
engineers.

104
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,170
We are no longer producing the most
amount of,

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,333
uh,
uh,

106
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,130
uh,
the most amount of,

107
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,641
of,
uh,

108
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,500
uh,
uh,

109
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,620
of new new companies.
We have been the technological lead in

110
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,950
the world.
We really had technical supremacy for

111
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,951
decades and are higher our lead,
our higher education institutions still

112
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,360
have that.
We have the best higher education system

113
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,600
in the world,
but if we really want to remain a

114
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,080
technological powerhouse in the next 30
years,

115
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,970
we need to start internalizing though
all those scores that are coming out to

116
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,940
explain that we're in the twenties in
math and science.

117
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,900
Our children are not as well educated.
They don't have the same work ethic

118
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,630
whether we like it or not.
That's what the test indicate.

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,860
And I think we have to look at the
systemic issues that are causing that

120
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,933
and go after it.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Enjoying them.
If you,

122
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,670
if you step back and you say,
uh,

123
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,940
there's a creative,
people will always give you the,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,190
you will spend most of your time on
creative people and,

125
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,380
and that means that they will be the
people that you,

126
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,790
you,
you know,

127
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,360
you want to most embraced.
Sometimes you're just most want to argue

128
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:17,840
with the others because it depends on
where they're going at any given at any

129
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,440
given moment,
but most will usually have to enjoy and

130
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,260
respect their creativity.
If,

131
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,590
if creative people believe they are
liked and respected,

132
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,860
then they will continue to be more and
more creative.

133
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,880
And I don't,
I don't necessarily relate creativity

134
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,060
with,
with lack of discipline.

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,180
You can be very creative within a
discipline.

136
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,580
So if we're talking about how do you
deal with undisciplined creative people

137
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,310
than I think,
then I think that's just a matter of

138
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,780
trying to establish a common goal.
