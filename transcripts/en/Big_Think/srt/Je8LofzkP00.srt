1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,270
I was teaching at University of Texas
and I was teaching a class in

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:10,770
interactive design and,
and this was in the sort of late

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,710
nineties and the Internet had had gotten
really big and my students were

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,070
grappling with notions of interface
design and really trying to figure out

5
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:17,460
what,
how to,

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,800
how do they engage users.
Um,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,120
and so I brought in a project where we
began to study games and the students

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:28,110
began to design and redesign games as a
way to understand what is good

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,130
interactive design.
And that is the first time that I'd

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,930
actually brought games into my own
classroom space.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,310
And the first time that I took people
who'd never done game design and put

12
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:43,290
them in the role of a game designer,
and it was a huge moment of discovery

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:48,291
for me because my students learn more
about how to engage an audience,

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,230
how to really communicate and how to
create really interesting,

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,090
unusual kinds of spaces when they used
game design as a starting point,

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,710
even though they weren't designing
games.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,580
Eventually the process of thinking like
a game designer gave them a whole tool

18
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,740
set,
this tool set that they hadn't had

19
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,270
previously.
Um,

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,810
and so that sort of set me along this
path where I began to say,

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,770
you know,
there's something just interesting in,

22
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:17,490
in this act of teaching people to design
games.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,230
Um,
and then I began to work with kids.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,730
And one of the most interesting thing
that happens when you work with young

25
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:28,731
people in designing games is how deep
they go into the content.

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,830
And so this is this question of where
the math and science,

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,330
um,
stuff might come in.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,680
When we look at kids and we talk about
that definition of who is a Gamer,

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,850
it's actually a really old definition.
There used to be a time when only a

30
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:48,420
certain population of kids played games
and they tended to be boys and they

31
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,360
tended to be kind of Geeky boys that
were hidden away in their basement.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,750
The truth is today when you look at who
was playing games,

33
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,870
particularly younger kids up to about
sixth or seventh grade,

34
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,410
it's all kids.
Um,

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,520
and most kids don't self identify
themselves as gamers.

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,370
If you ask them about that identity.
Um,

37
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:09,720
it's just something that they do.
So there's an assumption when we recruit

38
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,810
kids for the school that,
that all kids have to a greater or

39
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,000
lesser degree,
some experience playing games and an

40
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,760
interest in playing games.
The school is not,

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,130
excuse me,
it's not a vocational school that's

42
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:21,990
intended to graduate game designers.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,290
So that isn't actually any way that we
talk about the school.

44
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,870
Um,
and so the kids that we get,

45
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,871
our kids that are deeply interested in,
um,

46
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,570
a school that might feel a little bit
different than a traditional school,

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,910
um,
they tend to be really creative kids,

48
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,320
um,
that are,

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,450
um,
interested in ideas that they'll have a

50
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,120
chance to design stuff and make stuff.
Um,

51
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,790
they're kids that tend to be,
you know,

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,220
in some sense,
um,

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,050
high performing and having strong
interests.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,570
And those interests don't necessarily
have to be games,

55
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:57,450
but they might be interested in reading
or they might be interested in sports,

56
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,310
but they're kids that get passionate
about something,

57
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,080
um,
and get excited about a school that

58
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,790
might help them cultivate that passion.

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,630
So at the model at quest is that the
teachers collaborate with game designers

60
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,660
to design the curriculum.
So there's no expectation that teachers

61
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,840
have to be game designers in the way
that there's no expectation that the

62
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:19,690
game designers are going to be in the
classroom teaching day to day with the

63
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,250
kids.
Um,

64
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,910
so the teachers that we recruited mostly
came from the public school system.

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,580
We have a couple that taught at private
schools previously.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,670
Um,
none of them had a game design

67
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,840
background.
Uh,

68
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,490
a few of them had an interesting games.
Some of them had a background in

69
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,940
technology,
um,

70
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,170
but all of them were strong
collaborators,

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,540
had worked in context where
collaboration was key.

72
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,340
All of them were deeply interested in
the craft of,

73
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:50,140
of learning and,
and how to really work with kids.

74
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,570
Um,
and all of them were open to the idea

75
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:53,404
of,
uh,

76
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,830
being a curriculum designer and,
uh,

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,540
working with game designers and trying
to see where this model could,

78
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,070
could really take learning for kids.

79
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,370
I would say that it's not so much among
our parents,

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,110
um,
because any open house or talk that they

81
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,870
might come to you where they hear about
the school becomes really clear how

82
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,420
we're talking about games and how we
value them.

83
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,090
But there is a larger cultural
discourse,

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,640
um,
that I think is quite limited around

85
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:26,140
this issue of what's the value of games
and what's the value of play and video

86
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,800
games in particular because they've been
covered I think historically in the

87
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:34,540
media
as either a games that are about

88
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:39,370
violence or games that are about wasting
time.

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,450
Those are the two kind of dominant
narratives that people that don't know

90
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,940
much about games here again and again
and again.

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,030
And so it's a bit of a default
position that people fall into just

92
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,980
because they haven't perhaps really
thought about it.

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,320
Um,
any parent that,

94
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:00,940
that we have that has a child that
spends an amount of time gaming at home

95
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,800
actually understands something about why
that child is gaming and what they're

96
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:06,634
getting out of it.

97
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,650
And partially it is because they talk to
the kids.

98
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,900
Um,
and those reasons really vary.

99
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,300
Sometimes the,
the value of the gaming is,

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,750
uh,
around the,

101
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,130
the social structure and the community
that the kids have.

102
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,630
We find that that gaming is less about
the artifact of the game itself and more

103
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:25,990
about the community that sort of sits
around that game and that players are

104
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,840
part of.
And for many parents that social piece

105
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,010
is pretty big for kids.
Um,

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,740
for other parents,
there is a opportunity around creativity

107
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,630
that they see happening in these games.
They also see their kids persisting on

108
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,600
problems and games that they don't see
them persisting on another other spaces

109
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:48,520
and they begin to recognize that that
persistence and tenacity is actually

110
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,970
something pretty important.
They don't really know how to make it

111
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:55,840
happen in other kinds of spaces,
but they see their kids doing that and

112
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,621
they think,
wow,

113
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,750
if I can get my kid to do that when
they're working on math,

114
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,220
be that persistent.

115
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,890
There's something really valuable there.
Um,

116
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,120
so I think it's more this general
cultural dialog that's pretty,

117
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,480
um,
pretty narrow and pretty underdeveloped

118
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,700
at the moment.
And in part of the goal of this school

119
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,511
as well as some,
you know,

120
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:17,630
a lot of other people doing work in this
space is to try to complexify the

121
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,260
argument,
um,

122
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,230
and begin to understand that,
you know,

123
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:25,340
historically from the moment that human
beings sort of came into existence,

124
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:29,630
play was a part of culture.
It was a profound part of what makes us

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,790
human,
a profound part of what keeps the

126
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,990
community together.
A profound part of ways in which we can

127
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:40,991
deal with complex issues that are maybe
too complicated to deal with outside a

128
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,880
kind of play space.
Um,

129
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,410
and so the,
the notion and value of play

130
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:49,100
historically has been huge and it
doesn't make sense to me today why we

131
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:50,770
would dismiss it.
Um,

132
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,620
because it's something that we see
embodied in a way that maybe we don't

133
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:57,410
understanding and understanding some
digital games that,

134
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,910
um,
for many people look kind of scary.
