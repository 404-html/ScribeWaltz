1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,550
There's a proposal around,
it's got a lot of interest to called the

2
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:14,151
universal basic income where everybody
is guaranteed at least a certain level

3
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:19,300
of income in the society.
Some free market economists.

4
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:23,310
So like Milton Friedman talked about a
negative income tax,

5
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:28,311
which in effect has the same features of
guaranteeing a certain level of income

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,860
for everybody as a base.
I think from a human rights and decency

7
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,820
standard,
there's a lot of sense to the idea that

8
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,300
everybody in the society should be able
to meet their basic needs.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
There's,
on the other hand a sense if you give

10
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,410
someone a check,
uh,

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
whether they're trying not trying,
working,

12
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,880
not working.
If there's no effort,

13
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:58,770
no conditionality involved at all,
maybe we're going to get a lot of people

14
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:03,771
that are absolutely doing nothing on the
backs of those who are really working.

15
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,350
So the incentive issues are real.

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,380
Even if the sensitivity and decency
issues are also real.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,760
I think that one way to handle this as a
little bit more rounded,

18
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:22,761
rather than seeing a universal basic
income as a check and a kind of an

19
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:27,390
unconditional,
a check that's just handed out as

20
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:32,340
income.
I like the idea of social democracy as

21
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,310
it's applied in real countries in
Europe,

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,200
in the Netherlands and Denmark,
Norway,

23
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,550
Sweden,
Germany,

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,760
the ideas,
everybody has access to publicly

25
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:46,761
financed healthcare.
Everybody has access to quality publicly

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,000
financed education including college
tuition.

27
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:53,280
It's not a trillion dollars of crushing
student debt,

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,700
but tuition's paid for.
Everybody has access to not only

29
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,400
guaranteed vacation,
but paid vacation.

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,350
Everybody has access to quality
childcare so that moms can go to work

31
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:11,490
knowing that their kids are in a healthy
nurturing environment.

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,940
Everybody has access to maternity
leaves,

33
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:19,941
so the moms and also paternity leave.
Dads can stay home with their kids for

34
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,020
several months.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,310
It's kind of decent where you say,
we have all this wonderful technology,

36
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,560
this wealth.
Why don't we live decently,

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,150
not,
not miserably.

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,270
If people want to market income beyond
that,

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,560
they've got to go work for it.
If of course they are disabled,

40
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:39,870
if for some reason can't,
then there's added social support,

41
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,320
but it's not cash in people's pockets.
It's decency,

42
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,780
its public services,
it's basic needs met.

43
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,990
I see it as basically living decent
lives in decent societies.

44
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,410
They have a very different spirit to
them.

45
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,220
There aren't a lot of super rich Wall
Street Hedge Fund,

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,720
a misanthropes,
and I'll use the term advisedly because

47
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,370
I find a lot of people on Wall Street
don't give a damn about anybody else

48
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:13,840
except they care about their money and I
find that really weird,

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
but you don't find that kind of
idea in northern Europe because it's a

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,560
really looked down upon a and people
don't like it when people are money

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,190
grubbing.

52
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,000
They're kind of shunned.
So the social ethos is different.

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,210
I remember once I was running to the
airport in Oslo and I fly business class

54
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:44,971
and I'm constantly moving around and on
trips relentlessly around the world and

55
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:51,211
I ran up and where's the business class?
Line a to board and the guy looked at me

56
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,850
like I was crazy and he said,
excuse me,

57
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,750
you were boarding the Scandinavian way,
get back in line.

58
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,730
And I just thought,
okay,

59
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,870
that's pretty cool.
Actually,

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,470
you know,
everybody's in line and let's all get on

61
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,930
the plane.
It's a social spirit.

62
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,350
It's the idea that we'd like.
We'd like wealth by the way.

63
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,650
They're not a,
this is not people tearing their clothes

64
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,680
and living in hair shirts and uh,
and uh,

65
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,170
you know,
not enjoying themselves.

66
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,130
They light their vacations,
they liked their boats in the Stockholm

67
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,140
archipelago.
They like six weeks on their island.

68
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,990
So they,
they live beautifully,

69
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,110
but they don't want gazillions.
They don't,

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,930
they don't want to do it at the expense
of others.

71
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:41,200
They want to do it as a society.
God,

72
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,770
if America could just get a little of
that back rather than a,

73
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,290
a president who believes in killers and
losers sick.

74
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,430
But that's what we got.
And that is what's degrading American

75
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,770
society.
Not just the technical issues,

76
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,030
not just the rising inequality,
but this spirit that you're a winner or

77
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:03,280
you're a loser.
And if you're a loser,

78
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:06,010
get out of the way.
That's Ayn rand talking.

79
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,510
It's ugly.
Uh,

80
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,520
and we've had enough of it.
