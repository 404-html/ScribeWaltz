1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,370
An interesting statistic with Malawi is
that its forests are being stripped of

2
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:18,720
its soft pine because of the amount of
coffins that are being made because of

3
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,210
aids related deaths.
So,

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,090
you know,
you just expect this place to be sort of

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,690
gutted and sort of just an inferno of
misery.

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,710
But it was the act opposite.
Um,

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
I,
one day the longs that,

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,440
that the end of the story is because the
beginning of the story is long,

9
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:45,441
but I got lost and I was walking on the
side of a road in Malawi.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,280
My cell phone didn't work.
I really had no idea where I was.

11
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:53,520
My,
my guide or the person who was driving

12
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:58,260
me didn't know where I was.
And I'm sure to some of the people who

13
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:02,610
were driving past it must've looked
quite strange to see what they call,

14
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,860
I believe I'm,
I'm deemed Emma Zuniga there,

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,040
which means white person on the side of
the road.

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,980
Um,
and I kept on walking and I got to this

17
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:15,450
gas station and I asked,
could someone help me please?

18
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,550
I don't know where I am.
Um,

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,210
I don't even know how to make a phone
call to where I'm supposed to get back

20
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,930
to.
And this woman who worked there came up

21
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,550
to me and she said,
I can help you,

22
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,580
would you like to use my phone,
which was probably expensive for her.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,780
And she found,
she helped me get back to where I needed

24
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,360
to go.
But as I was waiting for someone to pick

25
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,260
me up,
uh,

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,603
they,
uh,

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,720
she said,
what are you doing here?

28
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,540
And I said,
I'm here doing stories about HIV aids

29
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,460
and women and women in Malawi.
And she said,

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,260
I'm one of them.
And we formed this,

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,110
this unusual friendship,
you know,

32
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:57,111
and that was like an experience that
really like kind of as a,

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,510
those people that you meet that kind of
changed your life.

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,360
Like here was this woman who works seven
days a week,

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,850
is a single mother.
Um,

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,230
she finds out while I'm there that her
daughter is positive and she's

37
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:15,231
supporting her family,
her perspective husband gave her the

38
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:20,811
illness and is outs and laughter and
it's out spreading this illness as well

39
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,530
among other women.
But yeah,

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,120
at this woman is the most graceful woman
I've ever met and the most dignified

41
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,370
woman I've ever met.
And

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,250
yeah,

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,430
was so lonely because she couldn't talk
about her status.

44
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,630
But in spite of that,
just exuded such warmth and such

45
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:47,520
kindness and
you know,

46
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:52,020
it was really meeting her.
You really saw the dichotomy of how cold

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,760
her reality was,
but this beautiful heart that existed in

48
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,400
all of this and the grace that she
existed in,

49
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:00,760
in.
