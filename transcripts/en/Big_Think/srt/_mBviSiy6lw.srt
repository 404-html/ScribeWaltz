1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,270
I grew up in the suburbs of New York.
I was very fortunate in that I had a

2
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,260
really good public education and that
public education actually led me to the

3
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:26,801
Rockefeller when I was 16.
I was passionate about biology and the

4
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:32,720
Rockefeller has a series which they
still have of lectures called the

5
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:34,940
holiday lectures,
which are lectures for high school

6
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:38,960
students right after Christmas and now I
guess there's a whole sort of internet

7
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,640
way of getting the tickets if you're
interested.

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,440
But then that wasn't.
The Internet didn't exist so the.

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,620
The way that they were distributed with
each high school in the area got to and

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,070
so they were quite quite a valuable
commodity at my high school among the

11
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:57,071
students who were interested and I was
given one and so I guess it was in 1976

12
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,650
in December.
I had the great fortune of hearing

13
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:05,651
Christian to do speak about the cell and
he gave this amazing tour of the

14
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,650
interior of the stem cell,
which I could probably sit here and

15
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:11,360
spend about an hour telling you about.

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,230
Which is kind of amazing because it was
so long ago.

17
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:19,520
But it was a brilliant lecture and in
fact the lecture is referred to in a

18
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:24,521
book that he wrote called vital dust,
which is also a wonderful book,

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,000
but I was just inspired and I,
I,

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,680
at that moment,
I knew that this was what I wanted to

21
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,510
do,
what he didn't know what that moment

22
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,760
was.
That was the place that I was getting

23
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,410
ended up doing it.
I didn't ever dream that I would be that

24
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:40,520
fortunate and I,
through a series of coincidence,

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,510
coincidence,
I got a summer job with a young

26
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,440
investigator at the time who was
studying dendritic cells,

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,860
which was something nobody had ever
heard of because he had discovered them.

28
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,210
This was 1976 and Ralph Steinman,
who was my mentor then in my mentor now

29
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,920
discover dendritic cells in 1971 or 72.

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,340
The first publications were Njm,
the Journal of experimental medicine in

31
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:08,900
1973.
So I came into the lab and he had one

32
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:12,530
technician and he was at the bench and I
was free labor.

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,980
So he was in his now rather frugal.
And I learned to work in laboratory with

34
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:21,800
him,
which was wonderful because shortly

35
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,180
after that,
probably two years after that,

36
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:28,181
he stopped doing benchwork himself and
he was remarkable in that he'd made an

37
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:33,200
observation that other people didn't
believe and he had the ability and the

38
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:36,620
tenacity to stick with that observation.
People thought that the,

39
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,360
the primary antigen presenting cell in
the body or the cell that would show

40
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,620
other cells anything foreign,
which is what an antigen is,

41
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,310
was the macrophage.
And Ralph had discovered dendritic cells

42
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,820
in cultures of macrophages and dendritic
cells are really potent.

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,450
You only need like one or are literally,
you need like literally 100.

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,060
And so when he saw something,
nobody else believed him.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,620
But Dr Cohen,
who was his mentor did and they were

46
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,910
tenacious and stuck with it.
