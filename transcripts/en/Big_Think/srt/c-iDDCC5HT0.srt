1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,620
One of the most surprising things I
think that people learn when you study

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,000
perception and you look at the research
is that we can be influenced,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,720
uh,
as perceivers by stereotypes that we

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,890
don't even believe are true,
uh,

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,170
so you don't have to be racist or,
or be a chauvinist or be at any,

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,050
any kind of a bad person to be
influenced by stereotypes.

7
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:29,190
It turns out all you need to do is know
the stereotype to be influenced by it.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,670
Stereotypes really are,
uh,

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,200
are an example of categorization.
Brains are,

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,020
have evolved.
Human brains have evolved to be very

11
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,920
rapid categorizes of things.
It's what allows us to interact with our

12
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,890
world so smoothly and effectively.
Right?

13
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:50,940
So you can go into a room and see a
chair for the first time and you know

14
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:55,620
that it's for sitting and not for eating
or climbing because you identify it as a

15
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,760
member of the category.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,570
Chair.
Stereotypes are categories of people and

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,070
sometimes they're actually very helpful.
So we have stereotypes of what police

18
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,830
officers are.
Librarians are nurses are like.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,760
And those stereotypes allow us to fill
in the blanks a little bit and know

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,760
without even talking to a member of that
profession,

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,320
something about what their job is,
how I'm supposed to interact with them,

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,710
what it's reasonable to ask of them,
you know,

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,940
how our interaction is probably going to
go.

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,060
The problem of course,
is that every stereotype is a

25
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:30,840
generalization.
I'm the done never applies completely

26
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,770
accurately to any one person.
And sometimes stereotypes are just flat

27
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:35,820
out wrong.
Um,

28
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,780
they're,
they're just,

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,580
they're just absolutely a unnecessarily
negative and completely untrue.

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,680
And yet we are affected by them because
again,

31
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,500
that's one of these phase one perception
things that,

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,100
that the activation of stereotypes in
the mind is odd,

33
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,240
relatively automatic.

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,030
For example,
I'm a female scientist and there are

35
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:58,200
stereotypes about women not being as
capable in science and mathematics.

36
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,290
So I like to get right out in front with
people and you know,

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,990
show them,
demonstrate my expertise in science and

38
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,270
math.
And so that I can counter that

39
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:09,360
stereotype before it has a chance to
negatively affect their view of me.

40
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,620
Particularly when the perceiver isn't
really motivated to be accurate about

41
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:17,280
you or is only getting really a kind of
a quick glimpse of you when they're

42
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,440
really kind of busy thinking about other
things.

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,730
That's when all of these things are at
their sort of the highest danger of,

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,060
of influencing and getting in the way of
being seen the way you really want to.

45
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,590
So as as the person who is being
perceived really what you want to be

46
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:36,180
able to do is get that other person to
really want to see you accurately.

47
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,130
The the best ways to do that are to get
that person to work with you in some way

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,340
or to get that person to to to to notice
that you can help them reach their

49
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:49,320
goals.
That's another really great way to get

50
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,260
people to,
to kind of get past the initial

51
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,630
assumptions and really take a second
look at you.

52
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,320
So be someone who's instrumental in
helping other people reach their goals

53
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:01,650
and they're going to be much more likely
to try to see the real.

54
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:02,070
You.
