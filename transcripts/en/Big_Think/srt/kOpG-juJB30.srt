1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,080
Hmm,

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,560
no doubt that there has become a growing
concern about the income disparity in

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:18,010
the United States up.
Ceos are making greater incomes and ever

4
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:22,210
before and the gap between what ceos
were making and the lowest paid workers

5
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,860
in those companies are making is
increasing.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,540
And there's no doubt that after 30 or 40
years of a war on poverty,

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,540
we still have a great deal of poverty in
the United States and we are the

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,180
wealthiest country in the world.
Clearly and other countries in the

9
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:35,380
world,
developing countries,

10
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:38,380
emerging countries,
the poverty level is far greater than

11
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:41,650
even here.
I'm not sure that increasing taxes on

12
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:44,290
private equity is going to solve all
these problems.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,630
I do believe though that Congress needs
to look at how to reform the tax code in

14
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,780
ways that does make everything work a
little bit more fairly.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,370
For example,
right now the tax code is 10,000 pages

16
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:57,790
or more.

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,790
It's virtually incomprehensible at are
from the former head of the irs is,

18
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,370
is,
uh,

19
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,203
as a,
uh,

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,200
a employee and he cannot fill out his
own tax returns.

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,440
And I don't doubt of any,
a former head of the irs or current head

22
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,440
of the irs can fill out their own tax
returns because it's too complicated.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,660
I think we need to simplify the system
much better.

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,420
And I think with simplification,
I think would come greater equity.

25
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,630
That's one of the things we should do,
but there's no doubt that the income

26
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:26,140
disparity in our country has increased
and we should do some things to,

27
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,610
to deal with it as soon as we can.
