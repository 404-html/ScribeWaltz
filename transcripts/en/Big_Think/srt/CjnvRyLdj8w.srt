1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,770
Yeah,
Ray Kurzweil and I've met ray several

2
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:09,790
times.
He's a super good guy.

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:11,820
I like him a lot and I'm glad he's out
there doing it.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,510
In this sense,
I'm not skeptical in a cynical way.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,940
I hope that those singularity people are
wrong.

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:18,720
No,
I hope they're right.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
I hope he does it.
I hope he lives forever because that

8
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,330
means I may have a shot at it,
whatever that would even mean living

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,300
for.
And so when,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,860
when people like ray say to me,
Schermer Schermer don't you want to live

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,390
500 years,
a thousand years,

12
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,224
you know,
it's like,

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,120
listen,
I'm 63,

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,100
just get me to like 80 without,
you know,

15
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:39,930
my brain going crazy and I'm losing my
mind and Alzheimer's and senility and

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,750
you know,
get me to 100 without cancer and you

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,150
know,
give me a 120 without being bedridden.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,330
Know just one step at a time,
one problem at a time.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,150
That's how progress really happens
incrementally.

20
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,880
Slowly.
I'm not this grand.

21
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,830
Let's aim for Utopia.
I mean aimed for it.

22
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,520
Fine,
but,

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,290
but just take it one step at a time,
you know,

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,981
cancer,
you know,

25
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:00,900
there's like 50 different cancers that
kill people.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,540
Just tackle them one by one.
Heart disease,

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,680
Alzheimer's,
and senility.

28
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:10,380
You just solved those problems.
And because we know that the human body

29
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,980
is so complex that if you live to 150 or
200,

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,680
there may be other things that happen.
We don't even know yet.

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,530
I mean,
most people 500 years ago had no idea

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,940
about Alzheimer's other than the handful
of people that seem to have lost their

33
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:24,491
memories.
But,

34
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,850
you know,
now we realize because most of so many

35
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,970
of us live that long.
Okay.

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,700
So that's the problem with um,
uh,

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,170
with that is,
is it's too utopian in their thinking.

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,770
Just incremental steps.
And then second,

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,453
um,
my,

40
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,600
my skeptical,
skeptical alarms always go off when the

41
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:47,601
chief proponent of an idea that's going
to be the next big thing always says

42
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:49,720
it's in our generation.
You know,

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,640
every religious leader and cult leader
in history is always said it's going to

44
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:58,260
happen now in our generation,
all the way back to Jesus who said there

45
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:03,261
are some standing here before me now who
will not see the end of a time before I

46
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,980
return.
Okay.

47
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,360
So,
uh,

48
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,290
and,
and we're still waiting,

49
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,813
you know,
so,

50
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,620
you know,
when ray said it's going to happen in

51
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,950
2014 within our lifetime,
ray,

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,770
what if it's 2140?
I know you're gonna you're,

53
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,410
you're doing all the blood cleansing
one,

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,730
but you're not going to make it,
you know,

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,970
like another century now and,
and,

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,240
and,
but even so,

57
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,090
what if it's 31,
59,

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,850
30 1:40 a thousand years from now.

59
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,130
I mean that's possible,
but you know,

60
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,440
you and I aren't going to be here to
enjoy,

61
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,850
you know,
why sell it like it's got to happen in

62
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:40,851
my lifetime because that always to me,
seems like you're just tickling that

63
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,750
part of the brain,
that religions like to tap in that,

64
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:50,640
that sort of egocentric.
It's all about me and I want to continue

65
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:52,200
on in the future.
I get that,

66
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,190
of course I do too,
but um,

67
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,420
but all the more reason we should be
skeptical when that idea on the table

68
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,560
being offered to us is,
feels too good to be true.

69
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,140
It almost always is.
Not Always,

70
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,010
but usually,
uh,

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,850
and so,
and there's hardly anything bigger than

72
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,240
offering in portrait and mortality or
the afterlife because.

73
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,543
Good.
So here's the problem.

74
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,930
When we are all aware that death is
real,

75
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,480
because we see all around us,
$100,

76
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,980
billion people have lived before us.

77
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,930
They're all gone.
Not One of them is come back.

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,380
Not even Jesus in my opinion,
but that's a different video.

79
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,560
Um,
and yet you can't,

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,040
you cannot conceive of what it's like to
be dead.

81
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,800
Because if I asked you,
picture yourself dead,

82
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,990
what do you see now?
Most people say,

83
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,750
well,
I see myself there at the funeral and

84
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,680
the coffin and you know,
my loved ones are,

85
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,910
you know,
hopefully grieving and there,

86
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,310
right?
No,

87
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,440
you wouldn't see that.
You wouldn't see anything because to see

88
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,690
anything,
you have to be conscious to conceive of

89
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,760
anything.
You have to be a,

90
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,360
you had been,
you have to be conscious,

91
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,300
and if you're dead,
you don't have any of that,

92
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,430
you're,
you're just really.

93
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,980
Death is just nothing.
And,

94
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,140
and the whole idea of the afterlife is
fairly new.

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,450
I mean,
the ancient Hebrews,

96
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,210
their idea of the afterlife was nothing.

97
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,070
You're just,
just nothing.

98
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,750
You're just gone.
That's it.

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,410
There's no place to go with angels and
flowers and whatever.

100
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,270
It's just nothing,
you know,

101
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:22,750
all that was added on centuries later
and uh,

102
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,810
you know,
and probably for socio political

103
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:26,620
reasons,
you know,

104
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,370
offer the peasants something nice so
that they'll keep building our pyramids

105
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,900
or whatever,
you know.

106
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:33,090
So,
um,

107
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,871
you know,
again,

108
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,990
we can't conceive of what it's like to
be done and yet we see it all around us.

109
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:41,140
So this creates something of a paradox
that we have to resolve in our minds.

110
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,450
Most people resolve it by thinking,
well,

111
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm not actually going to die.
I'm just not gonna do it.

112
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,020
I'm going to live forever or I'm going
to accept Jesus or whatever and I'm

113
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,520
going to heaven.
You okay?

114
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,870
Yeah,
but what if you're wrong?

115
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,470
That's,
you know,

116
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,480
it's not a,
it's not a Pascal's wager where you can

117
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:55,711
say,
well,

118
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:59,890
I've nothing to lose and everything to
gain because which religion and their

119
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,480
version of the afterlife is the right
one.

120
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,440
Which one are you going to pick?
Well,

121
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,080
the Christians were the right ones.
Yeah,

122
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:07,510
well,
there's a billion Muslims who disagree

123
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,540
with you.
You know,

124
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,920
they don't accept Jesus as a savior.
They don't think he was even the

125
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,120
Messiah,
the son of God.

126
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay?
So now what?

127
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,560
You know and they believe just as
strongly as you do.

128
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,690
So what if your God is the wrong one?
You're your version is the wrong theory

129
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,010
and they have the right one.
You pick,

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,400
you wasted your whole life investing on
this idea and you turned out to be

131
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,160
wrong.
Why not jettison the whole idea entirely

132
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,060
and appreciate the here and now because
that's all we have.

133
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,570
Whatever is in the hereafter,
here and now is what we have.
