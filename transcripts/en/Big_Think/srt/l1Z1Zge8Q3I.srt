1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,690
Yes,
we definitely will.

2
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:13,090
I think they wouldn't be new collecting
categories that we don't even exist yet

3
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:17,150
at this moment or that haven't come to
total fruition that are going to become

4
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,800
more and more important.
For instance,

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,730
a old portable telephones or old
computers,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,930
uh,
all these objects that we take for

7
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:31,580
granted that we use in our daily lives
and that we changed nearly every four to

8
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,290
six months.
Uh,

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,960
those will become collecting categories
in their own right,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,150
or I,
I mentioned earlier,

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,680
Japanese toys and robots.
They will become more and more valuable.

12
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:47,681
There will be a limited editions by
those artists who are great artists in

13
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:51,170
their own right.
And so these are markets that are going

14
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:54,380
to develop and go.
And so

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,480
it's this constantly evolving.
