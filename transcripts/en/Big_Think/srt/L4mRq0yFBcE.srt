1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,520
The war is over.
You know,

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,050
most of us have given up most of our
privacy already.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,980
If you are giving your all of your
financial disclosures online,

4
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,020
your credit card,
your social security and so forth,

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,880
I think the way we protect those things
can afford us the ability to protect our

6
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:24,820
medical records as well.
It's moving in this direction.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,340
In fact,
a one would say there is almost a moral

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:30,820
obligation for people to begin to
disclose at least a portion of their

9
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:34,990
medical records online because it's only
through that disclosure on a large

10
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,160
scale,
uh,

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,390
whether it's,
uh,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,650
you're not your necessarily your name
and your identity,

13
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:44,170
but at least you're finish.
You're phenotypical data and your

14
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:49,171
genomic data will allow us to create a
whole revolution in personalized and

15
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:51,610
preventative medicine,
which I think is a,

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,130
which is extraordinarily important for
the next few decades.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,460
We are testing what it is like to lose
privacy.

18
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:04,461
Now the loss of privacy inherent in
these technologies is a precursor to an

19
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:10,641
almost biological or extra sensory loss
of privacy that will come as the species

20
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:14,400
evolves.
Shame that could be used to control us,

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,430
will no longer be able to control us
because we'll find out that everybody

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,300
masturbates or everybody has this kind
of sex with their,

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,090
with their spouse,
or eat this kind of food or picks their

24
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,530
nose or does whatever.
A lot of taboo won't be taboo anymore.

25
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:34,110
And that,
which is truly taboo will

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,820
kind of rise to the surface in a way.
And we'll see what we all can kind of

27
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,690
agree that we don't want to do this.
If the species survives,

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,370
um,
we'll,

29
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:48,060
we'll develop that sort of organismic
capability and we won't be able to be

30
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:49,560
embarrassed by that stuff anymore.
