1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Just make sure on global climate that
we're talking about more than climate

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,790
and that you understand what climate
means.

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,310
There's a great argument that global
climate change,

4
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,700
which has become warmer,
has actually been a real positive.

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,840
We have less people freezing to death
even though we have some that are dying

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,050
and is that where the highest priority
for our resources is red or is it fight

7
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:29,520
email?
You mail nutrition,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,820
malnutrition around the world.
Whereas if fighting malaria around the

9
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,560
world are HIV aids.
If you gave me $200,000,000,000 to go

10
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:41,730
spend over the next 10 years,
global climate will be the last place

11
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:44,330
I'd put that money.
It would be in the malnutrition.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,550
It would be in a malaria,
it'd be an HIV aids.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,710
That's what we need to decide as a
world.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,410
It's sort of like giving a new heart to
a 90 year old.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,610
Do you give that new heart to a 10 year
old or do you give it to 90 year old?

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,270
You've got to make choices because there
are limited resources at the end of the

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,740
day and if I'm going to end up being
taxed for $100,000,000,000 worth of cost

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,240
is a consuming nation of energy.
I want to make sure those taxes go to

19
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,180
the best places we can for the world's
wealth and health,

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,240
health and welfare,
and I vote for doing that on the side of

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,840
hunger and disease way before I try to
create,

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,500
try to fight the fiction that I think
has been hoisted on us about what CEO is

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:26,130
really doing and we have to absolutely
educate ourselves just as I'm doing

24
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:29,700
right now about what is really causing
the problem.

25
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,730
Is it actually he the warmth the globe
causing ceo to to rise or is it CO2

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,210
causing the the heat of the globe to go
up and importantly,

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,820
if it is going up because of manmade
emissions,

28
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,330
is it all bad or is it actually arguably
somewhat good?

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,990
Is the Arctic actually melting because
of the wind changes or because of co?

30
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:54,930
Two is the Antarctic actually losing
five percent of its ice in one part and

31
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:58,530
growing out of 95 percent more,
make sure we get all the points of the

32
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:02,100
story and that we don't have special
interest groups lobbying groups,

33
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,160
whether it's the oil industry,
whether it's the environmental movement

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,170
or whether it's politicians or other
ngos telling us how the world ought to

35
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,380
work.
Let's get educated all of us on her own

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,130
and get past the rhetoric and actually
make tough,

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,780
tough economic choices based on where
our hurt says the world ought to go.
